The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment has been ported and tested
extensively on a wide range of C++ compilers and uni-processor and
multi-processor OS platforms including Win32 (i.e., WinNT and Win95),
most versions of UNIX (e.g., SunOS 4.x and 5.x, SGI IRIX, DG/UX,
HP-UX, OSF/1 a.k.a. DEC UNIX, AIX 4.x, Linux, SCO, UnixWare, and
FreeBSD), <A HREF="http://www.wrs.com">VxWorks</A>, and <A
HREF="http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/index.html">MVS
OpenEdition</A>.  If you have a problem compiling the ACE wrappers on
the platforms shown below please send email to the <A
HREF="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ACE mailing list</A> and we'll
try to fix it for you.

<DL>
<DT> <B>Win32 (Windows NT and Windows '95) </B><BR><BR>

<DD> All of ACE has been ported to the Win32 API (which includes
	  Windows NT and Windows '95).  The entire release now
	  compiles using the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x and 5.0 compilers 
	  (the 2.0 compiler may also work, but we haven't tested it
	  recently).  ACE can be built as both a static and dynamic
	  library, using the Win32 installation process described
	  below. <P>

<DT> <B> Sun OS 5.x/4.x (a.k.a. Solaris 2.x/1.x) using Sun CC 3.0.1, Sun
     C++ 4.0.x, Centerline C++ 2.x, and GNU gcc 2.7.x. </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> All the source code and tests should build and run without
	  any problems on the Solaris and SunOS platforms using the 
	  Sun C++ compilers. <P>

<DT> <B> Sun OS 4.1.x using Centerline C++ 2.x, Sun CC 3.x, and Lucid
  Energize 3.2. </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> Note that shared libraries do not interact very well with
	  Centerline C++ or Sun C++ on SunOS 4.1.x.  This is due to
	  odd behavior of the SunOS 4.1.x linker, which (1) does not
	  properly call constructors of global objects within shared
	  libraries and (2) does not call the init() and fini()
	  functions in shared libraries, even though the manual claims
	  that these functions are called!  In particular, this means
	  that the tests in the directory
	  $(ACE_ROOT)/tests/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/
	  will not work for statically linked services... <P>

	  Some versions of SunOS 4.1.x do not contain the
	  /usr/lib/libnsl.a library.  This library seems to be
	  optional since System V Transport Layer Interface (TLI)
	  support is optional on SunOS 4.1.x (in contrast, it's the
	  "preferred" transport interface on Solaris). <P>

	  The best work-around for now is probably to either add a
	  dummy libnsl.a in /lib (which may not be feasible) or simply
	  comment out the line: <P>

	  LIBS += -lnsl <P>

	  in the <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU</CODE>
	  file.  Naturally, any programs (e.g., the TLI_SAP tests)
	  that use the TLI wrappers aren't going to work! <P>

	  Note that on SunOS 4.x you may get warnings from the linker
	  that "archive has no table of contents; add one using
	  ranlib(1)" for certain libraries (e.g., libASX.a,
	  libThreads.a, and libSPIPE.a).  This occurs since SunOS 4.x
	  does not support these features. <P>

<DT> <B> AIX </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> The ACE port to AIX assumes that the user has installed the
	  AIX patch containing the dl*() APIs.  To use these APIs, IBM
	  has created a separate product (free to AIX licensees)
	  called shared library hookable symbols (or slhs/6000).  If
	  you don't have this patch, the sv* commands for compiling
	  and linking will not be present on the system. <P>

	  BTW, here's a technique from Rob Jordan &lt<A
     HREF="mailto:jordan@hursley.ibm.com">jordan@hursley.ibm.com</A>&gt  
     that can reduce the size of the ACE libraries by
	  about one third, and can also be applied to applications.  It works
	  by optimising the sharing of template functions, which are created in an
	  ``unusual'' way under AIX. It also speeds up compilation. <P>

	  Here's how to optimise the ACE library generation: <P>

	  Look at the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/ace/Makefile">Makefile</a>
	  in <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/ace</CODE>. Create a file called
	  <CODE>ACE_All_Src.cpp</CODE>, and add a line to #include
	  each of the source files
	  listed under <CODE>FILES=</CODE> in the Makefile. Create a
	  file called <CODE>ACE_All_Tmp.h</CODE>
	  and add a line to #include each of the .h files listed under
	  <CODE>TEMPLATE_FILES=</CODE> in the Makefile. Now update the Makefile so that
	  <CODE>FILES=ACE_All_Src</CODE> and <CODE>TEMPLATE_FILES=ACE_All_Tmp</CODE>. <P>

<DT> <B> Linux and SCO 4.2 </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> ACE has been ported to <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cleeland/ace/">Linux</A> and SCO UNIX
using the GNU G++
     2.7.2 compiler. <P>

<DT> <B> SGI IRIX 5.x and 6.x </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> ACE used to build fine using the SGI C++ and GNU GCC compilers for
	  IRIX 5.x.
	  It has been ported to IRIX 6.x using the SGI MipsPro 7.1 C++
	  compiler;
	  be aware that in IRIX 6.2 there is a number of patches that
	  have to be installed and exceptions appear to fail with the
	  O32 ABI.
	  Please check the config files for the details.<P>

<DT> <B> HP-UX 9.x and 10.x </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> The current HP/UX C++ compiler is incredibly lame and has
	  problems compiling ACE templates and achieving template
	  closure.  I've heard that the next release is better...
	  In the meantime, you might try using GNU GCC or SunC++
	  on HP/UX. <P>

<DT> <B> OSF/1 3.2 and 4.0 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX 4.0a) </B> <BR><BR>

<DD> The current OSF/1 C++ 5.4 compiler still seems to have problems
with ACE's templates. It compiles the lib and test programs, although
giving warnings about template usage.  Most tests run, some dump core.
Hopefully newer compiler releases will alleviate these problems.  <P>
 
GNU gcc 2.7.2.1 compiles without problems. All tests run (besides
minor problems).  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann &lt<A

<DT><B> UnixWare 2.01 </B> <BR><BR>
<DD>
     Steve Huston &lt<A HREF="mailto:shuston@riverace.com">shuston@riverace.com</A>&gt
	has ported ACE to work with UnixWare 2.01 and
	  its standard C++ compiler.

<DT><STRONG>VxWorks</STRONG> <BR><BR>
<DD>
     <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~levine/">David Levine</A> &lt<A
HREF="mailto:levine@cs.wustl.edu">levine@cs.wustl.edu</A>&gt has
ported ACE to VxWorks 5.2/5.3/5.3.1 with the GreenHills 1.8.8
and g++ 2.7.2 compilers.<P>

In addition to all of the other benefits of ACE, it helps
work around some deficiencies with VxWorks 5.3/5.3.1.
Some of these apply only with g++, at least thru version 2.7.2.
That is the version that is shipped with Tornado 1.0.1/
VxWorks 5.3.1.  The problems are:<P>

<OL>
  <LI> The program entry point cannot be called ``main''.  ACE
       renames it to ``ace_main'' on VxWorks.  While this may seem
       trivial, it is important with legacy code.  ACE itself ran
       into this problem.<P>

  <LI> argc/argv isn't used with VxWorks entry points.  ACE provides
       a wrapper function that transparently converts shell command
       line arguments to argc/argv form.  See <A HREF="#spa">below</a>
       for details.

  <LI> Unsigned long long support is not available with the g++ that
       is distributed with Tornado 1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1, or with
       GreenHills 1.8.8.  The documentation says that it is supported
       by g++, but try using it :-)   Wind River technical support verified
       that it doesn't work.  ACE provides its own 64-bit unsigned integer
       type, ACE_hrtime_t, so you don't even have to worry about this
       problem if you use it.<P>

  <LI> There a gory problem with munch that is severely aggravated
       by the presence of a static in the Wind River/g++ iostream.h.
       ACE hides this and provides an easy-to-use workaround in the
       very unlikely situation where it becomes a problem.
       Please see ace/config-vxworks5.2-g++.h for more information.<P>
</OL>

In addition, as noted <A HREF="#g++">below</A> following the
discussion of the g++ -fno-implicit-templates option,
-fno-implicit-templates is broken.  And, -O2 is not supported on some
targets.<P>

Please note that ACE uses one of the spare fields in
the Wind River task control block, spare4, for thread-
specific storage.  This field is specified in only one
place, in ace/OS.i, so it can easily be changed to one
of the other spare fields, if necessary.<P>

Versions of ACE from 4.3.3 and beyond destroy dynamically
allocated singletons in the ACE library.  But, they may not
properly destroy some static objects.  If you have trouble
running a program multiple times, it may be necessary to
unload the module, using unld, and reload it between runs.
Alternatively, you could try calling <code>cplusDtors</code>
and then <code>cplusCtors</code> between runs.<P>

<DT><B>MVS OpenEdition</B> <BR><BR>

<DD>
All of ACE has been ported to OpenEdition by Chuck Gehr &lt<A
HREF="mailto:gehr@sweng.stortek.com">gehr@sweng.stortek.com</A>&gt.
The ACE library, all the tests and most of the examples and apps build
clean.  There are still some problems that need to be ironed out: <P>

   MVS does not support the dynamic linking dl...() calls that the Service
   Configurator uses to dynamically link services at run time. As a result, all
   the examples and apps that use a svc.conf file (for dynamically configuring
   service objects) do not work, however, most of these apps can be built/run
   statically.  Also, the Svc_Conf_l.cpp and Svc_Conf_y.cpp files are generated
   using flex and yacc on a ascii (not ebcdic) machine and as a result they don't
   work very well with ebcdic svc.conf files.  We should be able to regenerate 
   these files on MVS but MVS doesn't have flex.  This is something that needs
   to be done. <P>

   Some of the tests do not execute properly.  This is a minority and over time
   the goal is to get to 100%. <P>

   The make scheme for some of the apps still doesn't work perfectly on MVS. 
   This is mainly due to the way shared libraries are handled on MVS.  See
   <A HREF="#mvs">additional build tips for MVS</A> for more on
   this. <P>

<H4><A NAME="g++">Compiling ACE with GNU C++</A></H4>

If you use the GNU GCC C++ compiler please note the following: <P>
	
<UL>
 	<LI> Earlier versions of G++ may not compile certain
	  parts of ACE correctly due to compiler bugs.  Please
	  upgrade to G++ 2.7.2 or greater. <P>

	<LI> Make sure to update your gcc "config.status" file -
	  this specifies whether your gcc install uses, for
	  example, Solaris's "/usr/ccs/bin" binary utils or
	  GNU binary utils. <P>

        <LI> Make sure that the linker invoked by GCC produces code 
	  that initializes static objects.  Please see GCC's 
	  documentation for using <CODE>collect2</CODE>.<P>

	<LI> By default, gcc (thru version 2.7.2, at least) uses
	  implicit template instantiation.  Besides wasting space,
	  this breaks the use of ACE_Singleton:  instead of one
	  singleton instance, there could be one instance per object
	  (.o) file that "sees" the template.  Therefore, we have
	  overridden this default in ACE by enabling the
	  -fno-implicit-templates option to CCFLAGS in all
	  include/makeinclude/platform_*.GNU files that set CXX to g++.<P>

	<LI> The disadvantage of this approach is that you must
	  add template specializations for all templates that your
	  application uses to your own code.  (The ACE libraries are
	  self-contained:  you don't need to add the templates that
	  they use internally.)  Examples of template specializations
	  occur in quite a few ACE .cpp files; see
	  apps/Gateway/Gateway/Proxy_Handler.cpp for one example.
	  An easy way to figure out what template instantiations are
	  need is to try to build your executable and pipe the output
	  through c++filt.  The linker will report the missing
	  instantiations as undefined symbols.  Iteration may be
	  necessary, if the template instantiations themselves reference
	  other templates.<P>

	<LI> Alternatively, you could apply the Cygnus template repository
	  patches and use the -repo option instead of
	  -fno-implicit-templates.  Please see the g++ FAQ and gcc
	  manual for more information.  The g++ FAQ indicates that
	  a new implementation of templates planned for version 2.8
	  will eliminate the restriction against static data members
	  in template classes, which would allow ready implementation
	  of a correct ACE_Singleton.  A final alternative is to
	  remove the -fno-implicit-templates option from the CCFLAGS
	  macro in your include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU, and
	  thereby use the default g++ implicit template instantiation.<P>

	<LI> Thanks to Thilo Kielmann &lt<A
	  HREF="mailto:kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de">
	  kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de</A>&gt;
	  for reporting the problem with ACE_Singleton on g++, and
	  for helping to find and implement these solutions.<P>

	<LI> On VxWorks only, g++ (thru version 2.7.2, at least, distributed
	  with Tornado 1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1), -fno-implicit-templates is
	  broken.  In addition, -O2 is not supported on some targets.<P>

<H3><A NAME="aceinstall">Building and Installing ACE</A></H3>

The following explains how to build the ACE on <A
HREF="#unixsvcs">UNIX</A> and <A HREF="#win32svcs">Win32</A>.

<H4><A NAME="unix">Building and Installing ACE on UNIX</A></H4>

Building and installing ACE on UNIX is relatively simple (the <A
HREF="#win32">process</A> for Win32 is different).  Here's what you
need to do: <P>

<OL>
<LI> Install GNU make 3.7 or greater on your system (available via
   anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu directory). <P>

<LI> Add an environment variable called ACE_ROOT that contains the
   name of the root of the directory where you keep the ACE wrapper
   source tree.  The ACE recursive Makefile scheme needs this information. 
   There are several ways to set the ACE_ROOT variable.  For
     instance, in my .login file I have the following entry: <P>

<pre><code>
% setenv ACE_ROOT /home/cs/faculty/schmidt/ACE_wrappers
</code></pre><P>

However, if you're building a number of versions of ACE (e.g., for
different OS platforms or for different releases of ACE) you might use
the following approach:

<pre><code>
% setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd 
</code></pre>

<LI> Edit the $ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h file to update things like default
   hostname and port numbers you'd like the programs in the
   $ACE_ROOT/{apps,tests} directories to use by default. <P>
 
<LI> Set the $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h file to point to the appropriate
   platform/compiler-specific header configurations (such as
   config-sunos5-sunc++-4.x.h).  This file contains the #defines that
   are used throughout ACE to indicate which features your system
   supports (see the $ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h file for many
   examples of how the ACE build configuration is affected by these
   macro settings). <P>

   There are config files for most versions of UNIX.  If there isn't a
   version of this file that matches your platform/compiler, you'll
   need to make one.  Please send me email if you get it working so I
   can add it to the master ACE release. <P>

<LI> Set the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU file
   to point to the appropriate platform/compiler-specific Makefile
   configurations (e.g., platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU).  This file
   contains the compiler and Makefile directives that are
   platform/compiler-specific <P>

<LI> Note that since ACE builds shared libraries, you'll need to set
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH to whereever you put the binary version of the
   ACE library.  For example, you probably want to do something like
   the following <P>

<pre><code>
% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</code></pre><P>

<LI> When all this is done, hopefully all you'll need to do is type:<P>

<pre><code>
% make
</code></pre><P>

   at the root of the ACE source tree.  This will build the static and
   shared object libraries and build the tests and the sample
   applications. <P>
</OL>

<P><HR><P>
<H4><A NAME="win32">Building and Installing ACE on Win32</A></H4>

ACE contains project files for Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x (*.mdp) and
5.0 (*.dsw).<P>

<OL>
<LI> Create a directory (e.g., C:\ACE) and copy all of the ACE 
     distribution into it.  This directory will be referred to as
     ACE_ROOT in the rest of this discussion.<BR><BR>
<LI> Create a file called config.h in the ACE_ROOT\ace directory 
     that contains: <BR>
     <BR>
     <CODE>#include "config-win32.h"</CODE><BR>
     <BR>
<LI> Now load up the project file for ACE (ACE_ROOT\ace\ace.mdp or
     ACE_ROOT\ace\ace.dsw).  If you are using MSVC 4.x, you will
     need to add paths to your global settings.  In 
     Tools|Options|Directories, add ACE_ROOT to your include path 
     and ACE_ROOT\ace to your library path. <BR><BR>
<LI> Each project will contain 8 different configurations.  These
     are a mixture of Debug/Release, Unicode/non-Unicode, and
     Static/Dynamic library versions.  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If you
     use the dynamic libraries, make sure you include ACE_ROOT\ace 
     in your PATH whenever you run programs that use ACE.<BR><BR>
<LI> If you are building for Windows NT and plan to use the STL 
     implementation that comes with ACE, then you can start building
     now.  If you are building on Windows 95, then you should add
     the line <BR>
     <BR>
     <CODE>#define ACE_HAS_WINNT4 0</CODE><BR>
     <BR>
     before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h and it 
     will turn off Windows NT 4 specific code.<BR>
     <BR>
     If you want to use the standard C++ headers (iostream, cstdio, ...
     as defined by the C++ Standard Draft 2) that comes with MSVC 5, 
     then add the line <BR>
     <BR>
     <CODE>#define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY 1</CODE><BR>
     <BR>
     before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h.<BR><BR>
     The default project files which build ACE library have various
     configurations to build dynamic/static, with or without Unicode
     support.  Although we recommend using the dynamic library, if,
     for some reasons, you would rather work with static library,
     you'll need to add the line <BR>
     <BR>
     <CODE>#define ACE_HAS_DLL 0</CODE><BR>
     <BR>
     before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h.
     Optionally but highly recommended, you can also add the line <BR>
     <BR>
     <CODE>#define __ACE_INLINE__ 0</CODE><BR>
     <BR>
     before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h to disable
     inline function and reduce the size of static libraries (and your
     executables.)<BR><BR>
</Ol>      

<B>ACE TESTS</B> <P>

The tests are located in ACE_ROOT\tests.  There are two corresponding
project files in that directory also (tests.mdp and tests.dsp).<P>

Once you build all the tests (Batch Build works well for this) you can
run the batch file run_tests.bat in that directory to try all the 
tests.<P>

<B> BUILDING ACE ON A WIN32 MACHINE THAT LACKS A NETWORK CARD </B><P>

install TCP/IP and configure it to ignore the absence of a network
card.  This is one method: <P>

<H4><A NAME="vxworks">Building and Installing ACE on VxWorks</A></H4>
For the most part, you should be able to follow the instructions above
to build ACE and applications that use it.  Use the
<a href="#unix">Unix instructions</a> for Unix hosts, or
<a href="#win32">Win32</a> instructions for Windows NT hosts.<P>

You'll have to let ACE know the target type at compile time.
There are several ways to do this; please see the
$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU
platform file for detailed information.<P>

The VxWorks platform_vxworks*.GNU files are set up so that shared
libraries are not built on VxWorks.  Only static libraries,
with .a extension, are built.  Therefore, it's not necessary
to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on your host
system when building for VxWorks targets.<P>

These non-default VxWorks kernel configuration <code>#defines</code>
are required with ACE:<P>

<pre>
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS		/* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS	/* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */
</pre>

For completeness, here are the non-default <code>#defines</code> that
we use for VxWorks 5.3.1/g++ 2.7.2:

<pre>
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS		/* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS	/* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_CONFIGURATION_5_2 /* pre-tornado tools */
#define INCLUDE_DEBUG           /* pre-tornado debugging */
#define INCLUDE_LOADER          /* object module loading */

It probably wouldn't take much effort to modify the
ACE library to not require <code>INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS</code>,
if necessary.

If you're first getting started with ACE and/or VxWorks, I recommend
just building the ACE library and tests first.  Some of the ACE
examples, in System_V_IPC and Threads, don't build on VxWorks yet.
Then try running the tests.  Please see $ACE_ROOT/tests/README for the
latest status of the ACE tests on VxWorks.<P>

<A NAME="spa">Please</A> note that the <code>main</code> entry point
is renamed to <code>ace_main</code> on VxWorks, to comply with the
VxWorks restriction against using <code>main</code>.  Also, if you run
<code>ace_main</code> directly from a shell, you'll probably have to
restart the shell (using Ctrl-C, if enabled in your configuration) in
order to be able to unld the module.  Alternatively, you can spawn a
new task to run <code>ace_main</code>, using either VxWorks
<code>sp</code>, or ACE'S <code>spa</code>.  <code>spa</code> can be
used from the VxWorks shell to pass arguments to
<code>ace_main</code>.  Its usage is

<pre><code>    spa main, "arg1" [, ...]
</code></pre>

All arguments must be quoted, even numbers.

The following explains how to build the ACE <A
HREF="ACE-netsvcs.html">network services</A> on <A
HREF="#unixsvcs">UNIX</A> and <A HREF="#win32svcs">Win32</A>.

<H4><A NAME="unixsvcs">Building and Installing ACE Network Services on UNIX</A></H4>

Building and installing ACE Network Services on UNIX is relatively
simple (the <A HREF="#win32svcs">process</A> for Win32 is different).
Here's what you need to do: <P>

<OL>

<LI> Build and install ACE on UNIX as described <A
HREF="#unix">earlier</A>.  If ACE is built at the root of the ACE
source tree (and ACE has been ported to your platform, of course) the
netsvcs static and shared object libraries should be built
automatically.  In addition, the server driver program
(<CODE>main</CODE>) contained in <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/netsvcs/servers/main.cpp">
$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/main.cpp</A> should also be compiled and ready to run.<P>

<LI> Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to where the binary
     version of the ACE netsvcs library.  For example, you probably
     want to do something like the following <P>

<pre><code>
% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</code></pre><P>

<LI> By default, if the shared object library is built, the services
     are linked into the <CODE>main</CODE> driver program dynamically.
     To specify which services should be linked in and executed, edit the
<A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/netsvcs/servers/svc.conf">
$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/svc.conf</A> file.  During your editing,
     you should update information (such as the default service port
     numbers) that affects the initialization of services in this
     file.  Refer to the <A HREF="ACE-papers.html#config">Service Configurator</A>
     documentation to learn how the configuration file is parsed and
     how the services are dynamically linked and executed.  In
     addition, refer to the <A HREF="ACE-netsvcs.html">Network
     Services</A> documentation to learn more about how to configure
     each network service. <P>

<LI> If you only want to link the services statically, simply remove
     or rename the svc.conf file. <P>

</OL>

<H4><A NAME="win32svcs">Building and Installing ACE Network Services on Win32</A></H4>

Once again, there are supplied project for both MSVC 4.x and 5.0 for
the Network Services.<P>

If you are using MSVC 4.x, you will need to add another directory to
your global include and library paths, ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/lib.  When you
use the dynamic libraries, make sure to also include ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/lib 
in your PATH.<P>

<H4><A NAME="cloning">Cloning the Source Tree</A></H4>

On UNIX platforms, I typically like to support multiple platform
builds using the same ACE source tree.  This idiom is supported by ACE
using the $(ACE_ROOT)/bin/clone.c program.  To build clone,
perform the following steps: <P>

<pre>
% cd $ACE_ROOT/bin 
% make 
% mv clone ~/bin 
% rehash
</pre><P>

Then create a ./build subdirectory someplace (e.g., under
$ACE_ROOT), and then invoke the top-level Makefile with the
"clone" target, e.g.: <P>

<pre>
% cd $ACE_ROOT 
% mkdir build-SunOS5
% cd build-SunOS5 
% make -f ../Makefile clone 
% setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd 
% make
</pre><P>

This will establish a complete tree of links.  When you do a make in
this directory you will be producing object code that is not stored in
the same place as the original source tree.  This way, you can easily
build another platform in a parallel tree structure. <P>

<B> VERY IMPORTANT! </B> <P>

If you use the "clone trick" discussed above, make sure that the
symbolic links are correctly in place before starting the build.  In
particular, if you plan to clone the tree, it is preferable to do so
before you start a build procedure on the original tree.  This is
because the build procedure create object directories (.obj and
.shobj) and the cloning procedure will clone these directories also.
You would end up with links pointing to object files of another
platform.  If you clone the tree after you've done a build on the
original tree, make sure to remove all ".obj", ".shobj" and (any other
files or directories) in all subdirectories before starting the build
on your cloned tree. <P>

<H4><A NAME="corba">Building CORBA Versions of ACE</A></H4>

Note that if you are compiling with IONA's Orbix implementation of
CORBA or Visigenix's implementation of CORBA, you'll also need to set
ORBIX_ROOT to point to the root of the Orbix source tree and
ORBELINE_ROOT to point to the root of the ORBeline source tree.  Since
many platforms don't have these CORBA tools the default for ACE does
*not* incorporate them.  Thus, if you are compiling with Orbix or
ORBeline, make sure that you set the symbolic links for
$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU and
$ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h to point to the the config* and platform*
files that have "-orbix" in them!

<P><HR><P>
<H4><A NAME="mvs">Additional Build Tips for MVS</A></H4>

For all intents and purpose, MVS OpenEdition (OE) is another flavor of
UNIX, therefore, the instructions under <A HREF="#aceinstall">Building
and Installing ACE on Unix</A> can be used along with the following
additional tips: <P>

   You can get a copy of GNU make that has been ported to MVS OpenEdition from
   the <A HREF="http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/index.html">IBM OpenEdition web site</A>.
   ACE's make scheme generates compile commands that have options and
   operands interspersed.  By default, the c89/cc/c++ compiler expects all options to
   precede all operands.  To get around this, you must set a special
   compiler environment variable (_CXX_CCMODE) to 1 which tells the compiler
   to allow options and operands to be interspersed. <P>

   Note that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is called LIBPATH
   on MVS. <P>

   Shared objects are built a little different on MVS than on
   other UNIX implementations.  This has been accounted for in the makefiles
   that come with ACE   When the linker (via the cxx command) builds the 
   libACE.so file it will also create a file called libACE.x.  This is a 
   side-deck file and it must be included in subsequent link edits with 
   application code.  For more information on this see the C/C++ MVS 
   Programming Guide.  If you want to build your application statically, 
   i.e., using libACE.a instead of libACE.so, you can set ACELIB to 
   ACELIB_STATIC in platform_mvs.GNU. <P>

   When the libACE.so file is built (via the MVS pre-linker and binder), you
   will get a rc=4 from the pre-linker.  This is ok.  This is due to some
   warnings about unresolved references which should get resolved during the
   link step.  Note, however, there shouldn't be any unresolved references
   from the binder (linkage editor).   You can get pre-link and link maps by
   uncommenting the PMAP and LMAP lines in the platform_mvs.GNU file.<P>
