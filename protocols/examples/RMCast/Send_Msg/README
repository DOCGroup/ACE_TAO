In this example SENDER sends a number (defined in Protocol.h, 10000
by default) of messages  to the multicast group. Each message has
an application-level sequence number. RECEIVER tries to receive them
and checks for damaged, lost, and reordered messages. Since reliable
multicast is used there should be no damaged or reordered messages.
There could be some number of lost messages at the beginning,
howevere (standard race condition).

To run the example start a one or more RECEIVERS, e.g.,

$ ./receiver 224.1.0.1:10000

Then start one SENDER:

$ ./sender 224.1.0.1:10000
