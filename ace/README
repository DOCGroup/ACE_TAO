ACE Portability Macros
----------------------

The following describes the meaning of the C++ compiler macros that
can be set in the config*.h file.  When you port ACE to a new platform
and/or C++ compiler, make sure that you check to see which of these
need to be defined.  It's helpful to check the various config*.h files
in this directory to see what's already been defined.  If you need to
add new macros, please send them to me and I'll add them to this file.

Eventually, most of this information should be auto-discovered via GNU
autoconf, which Ossama Othman is working on, at
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~othman/aceconf/.

Macro                                   Description
-----                                   -----------

ACE_CAST_CONST                          Used to work around broken
                                        SunCC ANSI casts that require
                                        an extra const.
ACE_DEFINES_DEFAULT_WIN32_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES
                                        Win32 only.  Users want to use
                                        a predefined security
                                        attributes defined in
                                        ACE_OS::default_win32_security_attributes
                                        as the default security
                                        object.
ACE_DISABLE_DEBUG_DLL_CHECK             Define this if you don't want
                                        debug version ACE search for
                                        debug version DLLs first
                                        before looking for the DLL
                                        names specified.
ACE_DOESNT_INSTANTIATE_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER
                                        Application will allocate its
                                        own object manager.  This
                                        implicitly defines
                                        ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER.
                                        Usually used with MFC
                                        applications.
ACE_MAIN                                Renames "main (int, char *[])",
                                        for platforms such as g++/VxWorks
                                        that don't allow "main".  Requires
                                        the use of
                                        ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER.
ACE_MT_SAFE                             Compile using multi-thread libraries

                                        failure (ANSI C++ behavior).
ACE_NLOGGING                            Turns off the LM_DEBUG and
                                        LM_ERROR logging macros...
ACE_NTRACE                              Turns off the tracing feature.
ACE_PAGE_SIZE                           Defines the page size of the
                                        system (not used on Win32 or
                                        with ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE).
ACE_REDEFINES_XTI_FUNCTIONS             Platform redefines the t_... names (UnixWare)
ACE_SELECT_USES_INT                     Platform uses int for select()
                                        rather than fd_set
ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_PRAGMA            Compiler's template mechanism
                                        must use a pragma This is used
                                        for AIX's C++ compiler.
ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE            Compiler's template mechanim
                                        must see source code (i.e.,
                                        .cpp files).  This is used for
                                        GNU G++.
ACE_TIMER_SKEW                          If a timed ::select () can return
                                        early, then ACE_TIMER_SKEW is the
                                        maximum adjustment, in microseconds,
                                        that ACE_Timer_Queue uses to
                                        compensate for the early return.
ACE_TLI_TCP_DEVICE                      Device the platform uses for TCP on
                                        TLI.  Only needed if not /dev/tcp.

                                        poll() event demultiplexor
ACE_USES_ASM_SYMBOL_IN_DLSYM            Platform uses assembly symbols
                                        instead of C symbols in
                                        dlsym()

ACE_WSOCK_VERSION                       A parameter list indicating
                                        the version of WinSock (e.g.,
                                        "1, 1" is version 1.1).

ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS                       Platform supports POSIX aio* calls.
ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID                     Use ACE's alternate cuserid()
                                        implementation since a system
                                        cuserid() may not exist, or it
                                        is not desirable to use it.
                                        The implementation requires
                                        ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS to be
                                        undefined and that the
                                        geteuid() system call exists.

                                        Defaults to 64.
ACE_DEFAULT_LD_SEARCH_PATH              Specify the platform default search
                                        paths.  This macro should only be
                                        defined on platforms that don't
                                        support environment variables at all
                                        (i.e., Windows CE.)
ACE_THREADS_DONT_INHERIT_LOG_MSG        Specify this if you don't want
                                        threads to inherit parent
                                        thread's ACE_Log_Msg
                                        properties.
ACE_THREAD_MANAGER_USES_SAFE_SPAWN      Disable the "check before lock" feature
                                        in ACE_Thread_Manager.  Defining this
                                        macro avoids a potential race condition
                                        on platforms with aggressive read/write
                                        reordering.

                                        ::{get,set}rlimit ().  The
                                        value of this macro is the
                                        enum definition, e.g., enum
                                        __rlimit_resource, for Linux

                                        this macro is the enum
                                        definition, e.g., enum
                                        __rusage_who, for Linux glibc

                                        is deprecated.  Instead, use
                                        ACE_SIZEOF_LONG == 8.
ACE_HAS_AIX_BROKEN_SOCKET_HEADER        Platform, such as AIX4, needs
                                        to wrap #include of
                                        sys/socket.h with
                                        #undef/#define of

                                        template destructor correctly. See
                                        "ace/OS.h" for details.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_ACCEPT_ADDR              Platform can't correctly deal
                                        with a NULL addr to accept()
                                        (e.g, VxWorks).
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_NAMESPACES               Compiler/platform doesn't
                                        support namespaces (or the
                                        support is not fully
                                        implemented.)

                                        problem with bit-shift
                                        operations.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_CONDITIONAL_STRING_CASTS Compiler can't handle const char *
                                        as rvalue in conditional operator.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_CONVERSIONS              Compiler can't handle calls
                                        like foo->operator T *()
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_CTIME                    Compiler/platform uses macro

                                        properly with datagrams,
                                        i.e. it fails when the iovec
                                        size is IOV_MAX.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_ENUMS                    Compiler can't handle large
                                        enums (e.g., HP/UX C++)
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_HPUX_TEMPLATES           Earlier versions of HP/UX C++
                                        are damned...
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_MAP_FAILED               Platform doesn't cast MAP_FAILED
                                        to a void *.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_MSG_H                    Platform headers don't support
                                        <msg.h> prototypes
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_MMAP_H                   HP/UX does not wrap the
                                        mmap(2) header files with
                                        extern "C".
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_NESTED_TEMPLATES         MSVC has trouble with defining
                                        STL containers for nested
                                        structs and classes
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_POSIX_TIME               Platform defines struct
                                        timespec in <sys/timers.h>
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_RANDR                    OS/compiler's header files are
                                        inconsistent with libC
                                        definition of rand_r().
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_READV()                  OS/Compiler's header files are
                                        not consistent with readv()
                                        definition.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SAP_ANY                  Compiler can't handle the
                                        static ACE_Addr::sap_any
                                        construct.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SENDMSG                  OS/compiler omits the const
                                        from the sendmsg() prototype.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SETRLIMIT                OS/compiler omits the const
                                        from the rlimit parameter in
                                        the setrlimit() prototype.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_T_ERROR                  Compiler/platform has the wrong
                                        prototype for t_error(), i.e.,
                                        t_error(char *) rather than
                                        t_error(const char *).
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_TIMESPEC_MEMBERS         platform define struct
                                        timespec members as ts_sec and
                                        ts_nsec instead of tv_sec and
                                        tv_nsec.  This is highly
                                        non-portable.  Currently only
                                        FreeBSD 2.1.x uses it.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_WRITEV                   OS/compiler omits the const
                                        from the iovec parameter in
                                        the writev() prototype.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_XTI_MACROS               OS header files have some
                                        problems with XTI (HP/UX 11).
ACE_HAS_BSTRING                         Platform has <bstring.h>
                                        (which contains bzero()
                                        prototype)
ACE_HAS_BYTESEX_H                       Platform has <bytesex.h>.
ACE_HAS_CANCEL_IO                       Platform supports the Win32
                                        CancelIO() function (WinNT 4.0
                                        and beyond).
ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_DL                      OS/platform uses char * for
                                        dlopen/dlsym args, rather than
                                        const char *.
ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SOCKOPT                 OS/platform uses char * for
                                        sockopt, rather than const
                                        char *
ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SPRINTF                 sprintf() returns char *
                                        rather than int (e.g., SunOS
                                        4.x)
ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME                   Platform supports POSIX 1.b
                                        clock_gettime ()
ACE_HAS_CONSISTENT_SIGNAL_PROTOTYPES    Prototypes for both signal()
                                        and struct sigaction are
                                        consistent.
ACE_HAS_CPLUSPLUS_HEADERS               Compiler/platform has
                                        correctly prototyped header
                                        files
ACE_HAS_CYGWIN32_SOCKET_H               Platform has cygwin32 socket.h
ACE_HAS_DIRENT                          Compiler/platform has Dirent
                                        iterator functions
ACE_HAS_DLFCN_H_BROKEN_EXTERN_C         For platforms, e.g., RedHat
                                        4.2/Linux 2.0.30/Alpha, that
                                        don't declare dl* functions as
                                        extern "C" in dlfcn.h.
ACE_HAS_DLL                             Build ACE using the frigging
                                        PC DLL nonsense...
ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS                      Compiler supports C++
                                        exception handling
ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_KEYWORD                Compiler support explicit constructors.
ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION Compiler's template
                                        instantiation mechanism
                                        supports the use of explicit
                                        C++ specializations for all
                                        used templates. This is also
                                        used for GNU G++ if you don't
                                        use the "repo" patches.
ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE                     Platform supports
                                        getpagesize() call (otherwise,
                                        ACE_PAGE_SIZE must be defined,
                                        except on Win32)
ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE                       Platform supports the
                                        getrusage() system call.
ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE_PROTO                 Platform has a getrusage ()
                                        prototype in sys/resource.h
                                        that differs from the one in
                                        ace/OS.i.
ACE_HAS_GNUC_BROKEN_TEMPLATE_INLINE_FUNCTIONS   GNUC 2.7.3 mistakenly
                                        takes the template definition
                                        as the place where an inline
                                        function of an argument class
                                        is first used.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES       GNU CC < 2.8 is broken for
                                        template classes. This label
                                        shortens the template parameter
                                        list by removing the iterator
                                        functionality in the
                                        Cache_Map_Manager class.
ACE_HAS_GNU_CSTRING_H                   Denotes that GNU has cstring.h
                                        as standard which redefines
                                        memchr()
ACE_HAS_GPERF                           The GPERF utility is compiled
                                        for this platform
ACE_HAS_HANDLE_SET_OPTIMIZED_FOR_SELECT Optimize
                                        ACE_Handle_Set::count_bits for
                                        select() operations (common
                                        case)
ACE_HAS_LLSEEK                          Platform supports llseek.
ACE_HAS_HI_RES_TIMER                    Compiler/platform supports
                                        SunOS high resolution timers
ACE_HAS_IDTYPE_T                        Compiler/platform supports
                                        idtype_t.
ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS                 Inline all the static class OS
                                        methods to remove call
                                        overhead
ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST                    Platform supports IP multicast
ACE_HAS_IPV6                            Platform supports IPv6.

					platforms that don't have IPv6
					turned on by default.
ACE_HAS_IRIX62_THREADS                  Platform supports the very odd
                                        IRIX 6.2 threads...
ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER        Causes the ACE_Object_Manager
                                        instance to be created in main
                                        (int, char *[]), instead of as
                                        a static (global) instance.
ACE_HAS_THR_KEYDELETE                   Platform supports
                                        thr_keydelete (e.g,. UNIXWARE)
ACE_HAS_THR_MINSTACK                    Platform calls thr_minstack()
                                        rather than thr_min_stack()
                                        (e.g., Tandem).
ACE_HAS_LIMITED_RUSAGE_T                The rusage_t structure has
                                        only two fields.
ACE_HAS_LIMITED_SELECT                  The select is unable to deal with
                                        large file descriptors.
ACE_HAS_LONG_MAP_FAILED                 Platform defines MAP_FAILED as
                                        a long constant.
ACE_HAS_MALLOC_STATS                    Enabled malloc statistics
                                        collection.
ACE_HAS_MEMCHR                          Use native implementation of memchr.
ACE_HAS_MINIMAL_ACE_OS                  Disables some #includes in ace/OS.*.
ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION     Avoid #including ace/streams.h
                                        in OS.h.  Users must include
                                        ace/streams.h, <iostream>, or
                                        <iostream.h> explicitly in
                                        their code.  Some platforms,
                                        such as g++/VxWorks, have
                                        trouble compiling templates
                                        and iostreams header because
                                        of static variables in the
                                        stream headers.  This flag
                                        will also avoid extra
                                        compilation and runtime
                                        overheads on some platforms.
ACE_HAS_MFC                             Platform supports Microsoft
                                        Foundation Classes
ACE_HAS_MSG                             Platform supports recvmsg and
                                        sendmsg
ACE_HAS_MT_SAFE_MKTIME                  Platform supports MT safe
                                        mktime() call (do any of
                                        them?)
ACE_HAS_MUTABLE_KEYWORD                 Compiler supports mutable.
ACE_HAS_MUTEX_TIMEOUTS			Compiler supports timed mutex
                                        acquisitions
                                        (e.g. pthread_mutex_timedlock()).
ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW			Compiler offers new (nothrow).
ACE_HAS_NONCONST_GETBY                  Platform uses non-const char *
                                        in calls to gethostbyaddr,
                                        gethostbyname, getservbyname
ACE_HAS_NONCONST_MSGSND                 Platform has a non-const
                                        parameter to msgsend() (e.g.,
                                        SCO).
ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SELECT_TIMEVAL         Platform's select() uses
                                        non-const timeval* (only found
                                        on Linux right now)
ACE_HAS_OLD_MALLOC                      Compiler/platform uses old
                                        malloc()/free() prototypes
                                        (ugh)
ACE_HAS_ONLY_SCHED_OTHER                Platform, e.g., Solaris 2.5,
                                        only supports SCHED_OTHER
                                        POSIX scheduling policy.
ACE_HAS_2_PARAM_ASCTIME_R_AND_CTIME_R   Uses ctime_r & asctime_r with
                                        only two parameters
                                        vs. three.
ACE_HAS_OPTIMIZED_MESSAGE_QUEUE         Use the semaphore
                                        implementation of

                                        platforms, in which case we need

                                        memory (e.g., Win32 and
                                        VxWorks)

ACE_LACKS_UALARM_PROTOTYPE              Platform/compiler lacks the
                                        ualarm() prototype (e.g.,

ACE_LACKS_UCONTEXT_H                    Platform lacks the ucontext.h
                                        file
ACE_LACKS_UNBUFFERED_STREAMBUF          Platform lacks streambuf

ACE_LACKS_UNISTD_H                      Platform lacks the unistd.h
                                        file (e.g., VxWorks and Win32)
ACE_LACKS_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS           ACE platform has no UNIX
                                        domain sockets
ACE_LACKS_UNIX_SIGNALS                  Platform lacks full signal
                                        support (e.g., Win32 and
                                        Chorus).
ACE_LACKS_UTSNAME_T                     Platform lacks struct utsname

ACE_LACKS_WRITEV                        Platform doesn't define
                                        writev, so use our own

ACE_LEGACY_MODE                         When defined, it will enable some code that is
                                        used to provide some support for backwards
                                        compatibility.

ACE_NEEDS_DEV_IO_CONVERSION             Necessary with some compilers
                                        to pass ACE_TTY_IO as
                                        parameter to DEV_Connector.
ACE_NEEDS_FUNC_DEFINITIONS           Compiler requires a definition
                                        for a "hidden" function, e.g.,
                                        a private, unimplemented copy
                                        constructor or assignment
                                        operator.  The SGI C++
                                        compiler needs this, in
                                        template classes, with
                                        ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_PRAGMA.
ACE_NEEDS_HUGE_THREAD_STACKSIZE         Required by platforms with small default stacks.
ACE_NEEDS_LWP_PRIO_SET                  OS has LWPs, and when the
                                        priority of a bound thread is
                                        set, then the LWP priority
                                        must be set also.
ACE_NEEDS_SCHED_H                       Platform needs to #include
                                        <sched.h>
                                        to get thread scheduling
                                        defs.

ACE_NO_WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN              If this is set, then ACE does not
                                        define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN before
                                        including <windows.h>. Needed for
                                        code that uses non-lean Win32
                                        facilities such as COM.

ACE_ONLY_LATEST_AND_GREATEST            A macro that indicates that the "latest and greatest"
                                        features of ACE/TAO should be turned on.  It has been
                                        replaced by ACE_LEGACY_MODE, which has the opposite
                                        meaning but serves the same purpose.

ACE_WSTRING_HAS_USHORT_SUPPORT          If a platform has wchar_t as a separate type,
                                        then ACE_WString doesn't have a constructor that
                                        understands an ACE_USHORT16 string.  So this
                                        macro enables one. (mostly used my ACE Name Space).

ACE_HAS_BROKEN_PREALLOCATED_OBJECTS_AFTER_FORK
					Under QNX/RTP the objects preallocated
					in ACE_OS_Object_Manager cannot be
					destroyed after a fork() call.
					Since these objects are only destroyed
					at application shutdown we take the
					simpler approach of not destroying
					them at all.
					Both QNX/RTP and LynxOS suffer from
					this problem.
----------------------------------------

The following macros determine the svc.conf file format ACE uses.

Macro                                   Description
-----                                   -----------
ACE_HAS_CLASSIC_SVC_CONF                This macro forces ACE to use the classic
                                        svc.conf format.

ACE_HAS_XML_SVC_CONF                    This macro forces ACE to use the XML
                                        svc.conf format.

ACE_USES_CLASSIC_SVC_CONF               This macro should be defined as 0 or 1, depending
                                        on the preferred svc.conf file format.
                                        Defining this macro to 0 means ACE will use XML
                                        svc.conf file format.  Defining it to 1 will
                                        force ACE to use the classic svc.conf format.
                                        ** This macro takes precedence over previous
                                        ** two macros.
----------------------------------------
The following is a partial list of where some of these macros are used
in the code.  This list was originally compiled by Jam Hamidi
(jh1@core01.osi.com).  It is now hopelessly out of date.  Hopefully,
someone will come along and update it....

ACE_HAS_ALLOCA:
---------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/SOCK_Connect.C
        for allocation of iovp
A
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Msg.C
        for alocation of iovp

  In solaris:
     alloca() allocates size bytes of space in the stack frame of
     the  caller,  and  returns a pointer to the allocated block.
     This temporary space is automatically freed when the  caller
     returns.  Note: if the allocated block is beyond the current
     stack limit, the resulting behavior is undefined.

  In HPUX:
     no equivalent.

  Notes:
     in HPUX it has to do new and delete. Affects performance.


ACE_HAS_AUTOMATIC_INIT_FINI:
----------------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Service_Repository.i
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Parse_Node.i
     include/Parse_Node.i
     include/Service_Repository.i

  In solaris:
     _init() initializes a loadable module. It is  called  before
     any other routine in a loadable module.
     _info()  returns  information  about  a   loadable   module.
     _fini() should return the return value from mod_remove(9F).
     This flag if set, doesn't do anything.  If not set, forces
     _init() and _fini() to be executed as is:
       dlsym ((char *) handle, "_fini").

  In HPUX:
     don't set.
     Maybe have to look into shl_load( ), shl_definesym( ),
     shl_findsym( ), shl_gethandle( ), shl_getsymbols( ),
     shl_unload( ), shl_get( )(3X) - explicit load of shared libraries
     Means Service Configurator won't be available.
     TBA.


ACE_HAS_CPLUSPLUS_HEADERS:
--------------------------

  Used In:
     ace/OS.h

  HPUX:
     set it.

  Notes:
     If this is not defined, libc.h and osfcn.h get included.
     Only needed for older compiler/OS platforms that don't
     provide standard C++ header files in /usr/include.

ACE_HAS_HI_RES_TIMER:
---------------------

  Used In:
     libsrc/Misc/High_Res_Timer.h
     libsrc/Misc/High_Res_Timer.C
     include/High_Res_Timer.h

  In Solaris,
     C++ wrapper around gethrtime(), which returns a long long.
         gethrtime() returns the current high-resolution  real  time.
     Time  is  expressed as nanoseconds since some arbitrary time
     in the past; it is not correlated in any way to the time  of
     day,  and  thus  is not subject to resetting, drifting, etc.

  In HPUX
     look into: getclock(), reltimer(), getitimer()
     maybe even vtimes structure vm_utime, vm_stime ?

  Notes:
     TBA


ACE_LACKS_T_ERRNO:
-------------------

  Used In:
     ace/OS.h

  HPUX:
     set it.

  Notes:
     if set, adds:
     extern int t_errno;


ACE_HAS_POSIX_NONBLOCK:
-----------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  HPUX:
     set it.

  Notes:
     if defined, sets ACE_NONBLOCK and O_NONBLOCK
     O_NONBLOCK is used in libsrc/Misc/misc.C to do a
       fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, opt)
     ACE_NONBLOCK is used in libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv.C in the
       disable member function and options passed to the open function
       in libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO.C


ACE_HAS_PROC_FS:
----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/Misc/Profile_Timer.i

  Notes:
     if set, includes <sys/procfs.h>
     the PIOCUSAGE define is used in Profile_Timer.

  Solaris:
     procfs.h defines things for the prpsinfo structure (basically to
     do a "ps" from inside a program).

  HPUX:
     don't set: obviously a different mechanism.
     Look into /usr/include/sys/proc.h.  The structure is proc.  The
     pointer to the kernel's proc table may be obtained by
     extern  struct  proc *proc, *procNPROC;
     extern  int nproc;


ACE_HAS_PRUSAGE_T:
------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Misc/Profile_Timer.h
     libsrc/Misc/Profile_Timer.C

  Notes:
     If defined, declares the Profile_Timer class that does start(),
     stop() and basically gets real_time, user_time, system_time for
     an interval.
     This stuff is highly non-portable.

  HPUX:
     don't set


ACE_HAS_SEMUN:
--------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Semaphores/Semaphore_Simple.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, defines semun as:
     union semun {
           int          val;    /* value for SETVAL */
           struct semid_ds      *buf;   /* buffer for IPC_STAT & IPC_SET */
           ushort               *array; /* array for GETALL & SETALL */
     };

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     in /usr/include/sem.h:
     /* The fourth argument to semctl() varies depending on the value of
       its first argument.  If desired, "union semun" can be declared
       by the user, but this is not necessary since the individual
       member can just be passed as the argument. */


ACE_HAS_SIG_ATOMIC_T:
---------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a:
     typedef int sig_atomic_t;
     This is used in the Reactor and service configurator.

  HPUX:
     set it.
     in /usr/include/sys/signal.h:
     typedef unsigned int sig_atomic_t;


ACE_HAS_SSIZE_T:
----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a
     typedef int ssize_t;
     used mostly in IPC_SAP.  (don't confuse with size_t).

  HPUX:
     set it.
     in /usr/include/sys/types.h


ACE_HAS_STRBUF_T:
-----------------

  Used in:
     include/Str_Buf.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, declares the strbuf structure as:
     struct strbuf
     {
       int      maxlen;                 /* no. of bytes in buffer */
       int      len;                    /* no. of bytes returned */
       void     *buf;                   /* pointer to data */
     };

  Solaris:
     defined in /usr/include/sys/stropts.h
     Sys V.4 Streams.
     uses strbuf as parameter to putmsg, putpmsg:
     int putmsg(int fildes, const struct strbuf *ctlptr,
          const struct strbuf *dataptr, int flags);

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     no SYS V.4 streams.


ACE_HAS_STREAMS:
----------------

  Used In:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/LSOCK.C

  Notes:
     if defined, includes <stropts.h>

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     no SYS V.4 streams.


ACE_HAS_STREAM_PIPES:
---------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Msg.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Msg.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Listener.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Listener.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Send_Msg.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Send_Msg.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Send_Msg.i
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv_Msg.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv_Msg.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv_Msg.i

  Notes:
     if not set, won't be able to use the SPIPE class (IPC_SAP) with
     rendezvous handles.

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     No sysV.4 streams.


ACE_HAS_STRERROR:
-----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a:
     #define strerror(err) sys_errlist[err]

  Solaris:
     /usr/include/string.h

  HPUX:
     set it.
     in /usr/include/sys/errno.h and string.h
     extern char *strerror (int);


ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING:
-----------------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     tests/Service_Configurator/CCM_App.C

  Notes:
     if defined, includes <dlfcn.h>
     with dlopen(), dlsym(), etc..

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     has its own:
     shl_findsym( ), shl_gethandle( ), shl_getsymbols( ),
     shl_unload( ), shl_get( )(3X) - explicit load of shared libraries


ACE_HAS_SVR4_GETTIMEOFDAY:
--------------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/Reactor/Timer_Queue.i

  Notes:
     has to do with gettimeofday ().

  Solaris:
     gettimeofday (struct timeval *tp)

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     it has gettimeofday (struct timeval *tp, struct timezone *tzp);
     most calls do a:
     #if defined (ACE_HAS_SVR4_GETTIMEOFDAY)
      ::gettimeofday (&cur_time);
     #else
      ::gettimeofday (&cur_time, 0);
     #endif /* ACE_HAS_SVR4_GETTIMEOFDAY */


ACE_HAS_POLL:
------------
  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     #if defined (ACE_HAS_POLL)
     #include /**/ <poll.h>
     #endif /* ACE_HAS_POLL */

ACE_USE_POLL_IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
    Use the poll() event demultiplexor rather than select().

  HPUX:
     set it.


ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T:
----------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     #if defined (ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T)
     typedef void (*SignalHandler)(int);
     typedef void (*SignalHandlerV)(void);
     #elif defined (ACE_HAS_SIGNALHANDLERV_INT_ARG)
     typedef void (*SignalHandler)(int);
     typedef void (*SignalHandlerV)(int);
     #else
     #define SignalHandler SIG_PF
     typedef void (*SignalHandlerV)(...);
     #endif /* ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T */

  HPUX:
     set it.


ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI:
-----------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/TLI.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/TLI.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/TLI_Stream.C

  Notes:
     TLI is the transport layer calls as in: t_bind(), t_open(), t_unbind(),
     t_optmgmt(), ... in SunOS and Solaris.

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     Not supported.


ACE_HAS_SYS_FILIO_H:
--------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, includes <sys/filio.h>.
     didn't find any reference to anything in this file in the ACE code.

  Solaris:
     filio.h defines FIOCLEX, FIOASYNC, ... as _IO('f', 1), ..
     for FIOLFS,.. solaris has this to say:
     /*
      * ioctl's for Online: DiskSuite.
      * WARNING - the support for these ioctls may be withdrawn
      * in the future OS releases.
      */

  HPUX:
     <sys/ioctl.h> defines FIOASYNC and some other ones,
     <sgtty.h> defines some like FIOCLEX.
     some are never defined.
     use #ifdef HP-UX to modify sysincludes.h


ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST:
--------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/Log_Msg/Log_Msg.C

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a:
     extern const char **_sys_siglist;

  Solaris:
     This is an array holding signal descriptions.

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     Some additional work is required.  In libsrc/Log_Msg/Log_Msg.C,
     sys_siglist is used regardless of ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST.
     have to add #ifdefs to remove them.


ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS:
--------------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/ASX/*.[Chi]

  Notes:
     cfront-based C++ compilers don't implement templates that support
     classes with typedefs of other types as formal arguments.  This
     typedef uses the C++ preprocessor to work around this problem.

ACE_HAS_THREADS:
----------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Svc_Conf.y.C
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Thread_Spawn.i
     libsrc/Threads/Synch.C
     libsrc/Threads/Synch.i
     libsrc/Threads/Thr_Manager.i
     libsrc/ASX/STREAM.C
     libsrc/ASX/Queue.C
     libsrc/ASX/Module.C
     libsrc/ASX/Stream_Modules.C
     libsrc/ASX/Multiplexor.C
     libsrc/ASX/Message_List.C
     include/Message_List.h
     include/Module.h
     include/Multiplexor.h
     include/Queue.h
     include/STREAM.h
     include/Stream_Modules.h
     include/Service_Types.h
     include/Thread_Spawn.h
     include/Synch.h
     include/Thr_Manager.h

  Notes:
     We use Message_List.h even in a non-threaded environment.
     our XOMessageList.h does this by #ifdefs around Threaded things.

  HPUX:
     not until 10.0.


ACE_HAS_THREAD_T:
-----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     #if !defined (ACE_HAS_THREAD_T)
     typedef int thread_t;
     #endif /* !ACE_HAS_THREAD_T */

  HPUX:
     don't set.


ACE_HAS_TIMOD_H:
----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if defined, include <sys/timod.h>

  Solaris:
     timod is a STREAMS module for use with the Transport  Inter-
     face  (TI)  functions  of the Network Services library.  The
     timod module converts a set of ioctl(2) calls  into  STREAMS
     messages  that  may be consumed by a transport protocol pro-
     vider that supports the Transport Interface.  This allows  a
     user to initiate certain TI functions as atomic operations.

  HPUX:
     don't set.


ACE_HAS_TIUSER_H:
-----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if set, includes <tiuser.h>

  Solaris:
     in conjunction with t_bind, t_accept, etc.. transport layer.

  HPUX:
     don't set.


ACE_USE_POLL_IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Reactor/Reactor.i
     include/Event_Handler.h
     ace/OS.h
     include/Reactor.h

  Notes:
     in the reactor, use poll instead of select.  In general,
     good thing to have set.
