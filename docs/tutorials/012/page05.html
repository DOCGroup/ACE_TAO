The Task is the only object we've not been through yet.  I'll go ahead 
and show both the header and cpp on this one page since the header
isn't very large.

  This is our basic thread-pool Task.  We have a choice of pool size

  synchronization of our svc() methods so that they all start at the
  "<font color=green>same</font>" time.  The normal case may allow one thread to start working
  earlier than others.  There's no real harm in it but you can get
  better "<font color=green>work by thread</font>" statistics if they start out together.

<P>
Like main() this is actually simpler than the previous tutorial.  It's 
much cleaner to carry around a pointer to the object we're working
with than to try copying data.
<P>
The only complication is the new ACE_Barrier.  It's a pretty simple
object that makes it easy for you to synch threads in this way.  You
could do some fancy tricks with mutexes, counters & semaphores but why 
bother when the Barrier already exists.
