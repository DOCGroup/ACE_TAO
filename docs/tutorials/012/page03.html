In the previous tutorial we moved our complex data into the queue by
copy()ing it directly into the message block's data area.  I hope that 
most readers got a queasy feeling when I did that.  It just isn't a
good idea...
<P>
A better idea would be to teach the message queue about our data types 
(or at least a baseclass) so that it can more efficiently handle things:

  We derive a Message_Block from ACE_Message_Block and teach it about
  our Unit_Of_Work object.  When our task's svc() method pulls a block
  out of the queue, it can then invoke the virtual methods of the work
  object safely.  In this implementation we've also retained the
  original ACE_Message_Block functionallity so that we can use the
  underlying ACE_Data_Block objects to store data other than our
  Unit_Of_Work.

<P>
Ok, this looks pretty good.  We just construct our specialized
Message_Block instead of the generic ACE_Message_Block and let it
carry our data along.  When our application is done with the message
block and release()es it, we know that our work object will also be
taken care of.
<P>
Let's now go to main() and see what we had to change there to use this 
specialization.
