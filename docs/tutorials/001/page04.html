    <font color=red>/* Invoke the recv() method of the ACE_SOCK_Stream to get some
      data.  It will return -1 if there is an error.  Otherwise, it
      will return the number of bytes read.  Of course, if it read
      zero bytes then the connection must be gone.  How do I know
      that?  Because handle_input() would not be called by the reactor
      if there wasn't *some* kind of activity and a closed connection
      looks like a read request to the reactor.  But when you read
      from a closed connection you'll read zero bytes.

      Notice that in the error case or closed case we return -1.  That
      tells the reactor to call our handle_close() where we'll take
      care of shutting down cleanly.

      Although we don't make use of them, there are additional
      parameters you can use with the recv() call.  One of these is an
      ACE_Time_Value that allows you to limit the amount of time
      blocking on the recv().  You would use that if you weren't sure
      if data was available.  Since we only get to handle_input() when
      data is ready, that would be redundant.  On the other hand, if
      you use recv_n() to read *exactly* a number of bytes then
      limiting the time you wait for those bytes might be good.  The
      other paramter that may come in handy is an integer
      &lt;i>flags&lt;/i>.  This is passed directly to the underlying OS
      recv() call.  See the man page recv(2) and the header
      sys/socket.h for the gory details. */</font>

<P>
The comments really should tell the story.  The really
interesting stuff is in <i>handle_input()</i>.  Everything
else is just housekeeping.
In the future, we'll learn about ACE_Svc_Handler&lt;>
which will take care of most of the housekeeping for us.
