@(#)HISTORY	1.1 95/09/13

Mmmmmmmm DD, 1995 -- RELEASE 1.3:
---------------------------------
Release 1.3 includes bugfixes, and support for the COM binary interface
model, both on UNIX and on MS-Windows platforms.  The source tree has
been considerably restructured, with the goal of enabling addition of
other components at both the binary and source levels.


September 1, 1995 -- RELEASE 1.2:
---------------------------------
Release 1.2 includes fixes for problems noted in the recent multivendor
interoperability testing at Object World, and as reported by other users on
the Internet.  The most notable of these is that in some cases, when using
multiple connections to IIOP servers and clients, the connection management
code previously would get confused about which connection was which.  (One
consequence of fixing this is that an old test has been removed.)  Also,
there was no simple way to use Solaris 2.4 threads; see the Makefile for
details.  A few other minor features were added to facilitate use of this
code for more than just protocol testing.


June 28, 1995 -- RELEASE 1.1:
-----------------------------
Release 1.1 includes support for several new platforms.  Particular thanks
go to the team at APM, which contributed the bulk of the new "autoconf"
support (substantially enhancing portability), support for DEC Alpha and
HP 9000 platforms, runtime initialization of the size and alignment table
used to drive the typecode interpreter, and more; see README.apm for details.

Release 1.1 includes POSIX.1c threading support; on platforms which provide
POSIX.1c threads, applications will be able to take advantage of them.

Union and indirection support has been added to the TypeCode interpreter,
and more typecode utility APIs have been implemented.  Various bugfixes and
cleanup have also been provided.  Unfinished stubs for the COS Naming service
are included; these rely on C++ exception support.


March 21, 1995 -- RELEASE 1.0:
------------------------------
The original release ran on a set of UNIX platforms (including Solaris,
SunOS, Linux, and NEXTSTEP) as well as with 16-bit and 32-bit MS-Windows.
