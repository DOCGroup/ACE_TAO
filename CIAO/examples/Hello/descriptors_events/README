Event Descriptors for Hello Example
===================================

This folder contains several deployemnts to demonstrate and test the
functionality of rt event channel integration into CIAO/DAnCE.
Please see $CIAO_ROOT/docs/schema/CIAOEvents.txt for a detailed description
how to configure descriptor files accordingly.

The rest of this file describes the rule of the files in this directory.

single files and their role:
----------------------------

./run_test.pl			: script that executes all available tests

./run_NodeDaemons.pl 		: script to launch two empty NodeApplications
./run_NodeDaemons_svc_conf.pl 	: starts two node NodeApplications on the 
				  localhost interface and loads rtec.conf on 
				  startup
./run_NodeDaemons_with_ip.pl 	: starts two node NodeApplications under the
				  IP address and not on the localhost interface

./NodeManagerMap.dat		: contains ip addresses for SenderNode and 
				  ReceiverNode (both on localhost)
./NodeManagerMap_collocated.dat	: contains an ip address for a single 
				  SenderNode (on localhost)
./NodeManagerMapTwoHosts.dat	: contains ip addresses for SenderNode 
				  (on localhost) and ReceiverNode 
				  (on real ip address)

./rtec.conf			: example for a service configurator file 
				  for the event service


existing test cases:
--------------------

./ciao-events-example.ced
./deploymentplan_events.cdp 
./run_test_simple.pl

	Uses the standard event service and connects one sender to one 
	receiver. In the standard configuration, used here, the EventChannel 
	is running collocated within the NodeApplication "SenderNode", where
	the sender component is located:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES] --> ReceiverNode[Receiver]

./ciao-events-example-collocated.ced
./deploymentplan_events_collocated.cdp 
./run_test_collocated.pl:

	This example modifies the standard example by deploying all components
	within one node:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES --> Receiver]

./ciao-events-example-with-federation.ced
./deploymentplan_federation.cdp
./run_test_federated.pl:

	In this example, two Event Services ES_01 and ES_02 are federated.
	The Sender Event Port is then connected to the first service, while
	the Receiver gets its events from the second service.
	All entities are collocated in one node process:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES_01 --> ES_02 --> Receiver]

	(problem:
	Receiver - Informed by the Sender with message [ACE/TAO/CIAO]
	CORBA EXCEPTION caught
	(27698|3072210624) EXCEPTION, RTEventServiceConsumer_impl::push()

	system exception, ID 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/BAD_INV_ORDER:1.0'
	Unknown vendor minor code id (0), minor code = 0, completed = NO
	)

./ciao-events-example-with-filters.ced
./deploymentplan_with_filters.cdp
./run_test_filtered.pl:

	This example applies a filter to the EventService connection on the
 	receiver side. In this case the filter contains a disjunction group
	of two sender component sources.
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES -{Filter}-> Receiver]

./ciao-events-federation-mcast.ced
./deploymentplan_federation_mcast.cdp
./run_test_multicast.pl:

	To test collocated use of multicast federation of event channels
	use this example. It deploys sender and receiver in the same
	node and connects them through two eventchannels, using udp 
	multicast to communicate:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES_01 --> udp_sender -UDP{224.9.9.2:1234}-> 
	    udp_mcast_receiver --> ES_02 --> Receiver]	


	(unresolved failure:
	Create a receiver object with addr_serv_id: addr_serv_1
	(20850|3072210624) EXCEPTION, NodeApplication_Impl::finishLaunch	

	system exception, ID 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/UNKNOWN:1.0'
	OMG minor code (1), described as 'Unlisted user exception received by c
	lient.', completed = MAYBE
	)

./ciao-events-federation-udp.ced
./deploymentplan_federation_udp.cdp
./run_test_udp.pl:

	In this example, udp communication is used to send the event
	from one sender node to a receiver node:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES --> udp_sender] -UDP{localhost:1234}->
	    ReceiverNode[udp_receiver --> ES_02 --> Receiver]

./ciao-events-federation-udp-collocated.ced
./deploymentplan_federation_udp_collocated.cdp
./run_test_udp_collocated.pl:

	Same example, as the above udp example, but deployed on a
	single node application and therefore collocated:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES_01 --> udp_sender -UDP{localhost:1234}-> 
	    udp_receiver --> ES_02 --> Receiver]

./ciao-events-federation-udp-two-hosts.ced
./deploymentplan_federation_udp_two_hosts.cdp

	this test is not yet automated, because the nodes are
	supposed to be deployed on two different host machines:
	SenderNode[Sender --> ES_01 --> udp_sender] 
	    -UDP{129.59.129.181:1234}-> 
	        ReceiverNode[udp_receiver --> ES_02 --> ReceiverNode]

./ciao-events-example.ced
./deploymentplan_multiple_senders.cdp
./run_test_multiple_senders.pl:

	This example extends the standard example by adding two more sender
	components to the SenderNode:
		  [Sender01  -->    ]	
	SenderNode[Sender02  --> ES ] --> ReceiverNode[Receiver]
		  [Sender03  -->    ]
