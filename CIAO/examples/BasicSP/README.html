This document describes how to compile/run the BasicSP (HUDisplay) example with the new DnC implementation.

<H3> Installing </H3>

<UL>
  <LI> Make sure you have the latest DAnCE framework built.

    <br><br>
    <em>NOTE</em>:  <br>
           While buiding DAnCE, we also suggest that you build the tests in the $CIAO_ROOT/test directory and make sure
           all the tests run OK before you proceed to try out the BasicSP example or any other DAnCE-based
           applications. To do this, open the file

          After this, go back to the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE directory to generate your workspace/project or makefile by using MPC.<br>
          After the DAnCE and the tests are build OK, go to the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/tests/NodeApplicationTest directory and make
          sure all the three perl scripts (run_test.pl, run_test_simple.pl and run_test_ex.pl) run successfully.

  <LI> Generate the project/make files for the <em> BasicSP </em> example directory:
    <UL>
    <LI> <em> linux: </em> <code> [in $CIAO_ROOT/examples/BasicSP] mwc.pl -type gnuace</code> </LI>
    <LI> <em> windows: </em> <code> [in %CIAO_ROOT%/examples/BasicSP] mwc.pl -type vc71</code> </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>


  <LI> Build the generated solution/make files </LI>
</UL>

<H3> Running the test </H3>

<UL>

  <LI> Change into the $CIAO_ROOT/examples/BasicSP/descriptors directory Start NodeManagers (NodeDameon) by running <code> basicNodeDaemon.pl </code>

  <LI> Start the execution manager:
  <code>$DANCE_ROOT/bin/dance_execution_manager -o EM.ior -i NodeManagerMap.dat </code>
  </LI>

  <LI> Start the executor:
  <code>$DANCE_ROOT/bin/dance_plan_launcher -p flattern_deploymentplan.cdp -k file://EM.ior </code>

  <LI> After this, components should be deployed successfully. You can run the $CIAO_ROOT/examples/BasicSP/EC/controller to start the application.
       Please make sure that the component IOR file for the EC component is present when you run this client.
