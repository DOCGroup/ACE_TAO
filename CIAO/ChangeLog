          - Changes incorporating enhancements by folks at Thales ATM to 
            better handle the mapping of escaped identifiers (masking
            IDL keywords) and identifiers that are C++ keywords from
            IDL3 to IDL2. Thanks to Hakim Souami
            <hakim dot souami at thalesatm dot com> for leading this
            effort.
            
          - Further changes to build on those above by adding keyword
            handling support for scoped names and component port names.
            
          - Addition of the capability, also from Thales ATM, to 
            optionally generate #includes of IDL files without the
            addition of the default '_IDL2' suffix. This feature is
            necessary when included IDL files aren't available for
            conversion or when 'system' IDL files are included and
            contain only IDL declarations with no 'implied IDL'
            mapping. It is also handy for users who may have similar
            IDL files included and don't wish to run the conversion
            on them needlessly. While Thales ATM's version of this
            feature uses a list of 'excluded' filenames in a text
            file, the feature in this version uses a command line
            option '-x <filename>' for each file to be excluded.

        * examples/BasicSP/BMDisplay/BMDisplay.mpc:

          Added a dependency from BMDisplay_exec to BasicSP_exec.  Fixes
          problems due to build order.  Thanks to Johnny and Gan for
          reporting the problem.
