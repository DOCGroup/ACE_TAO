          Fixed memory leak in the register_type/unregister_type implemenation. This
          memory existed because of the fact that two different topics where based
          on the same datatype.
          To fix this, a new map was created wich contains the DomainParticipant in
          combination with the already existing type factories. Type factories
          are now stored and removed per DomainParticipant.

          Don't throw an exception when a wrong QosProfile is applied. In the
          end the creation of the DDS entity will fail. As a result to that, an
          exception is thrown. This'll simply code and logging.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/tests/QosProfile/descriptors/PlanMultipleHashes.cdp:

          Improved handling of Qos profile string. Throwing a ::CORBA::INTERAL

        * bin/generate_component_mpc.pl:
          Added a -I as commandline parameter. This will set an

        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/DataReaderHandler_T.h:
        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/DataReaderHandler_T.cpp:
          Adding and removing reference manually. This'll prevent removing the
