          in progress, some lwccm code uses methods from full ccm which
          means that code has to be rewritten to use other types. First step
          is to update all IDL and get code to compile to see what runs
          and what not

        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/dds/DDS_State_Connector_T.h:
        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/dds/DDS_State_Connector_T.cpp:
          When an extended port is partially or fully connected,
          all basic ports in this extended port are initialised.
          When an extended port is not connected. non of the basic
          ports will be connected.
          This means that the performance should increase and
          the usage of ports (and configuring them in the deployment
          plans) is more strict.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/tests/CSLSampleRejected/descriptors/Plan.cdp:
          Removed connector status listener since the sample rejected status isn't part

        * connectors/dds4ccm/tests/On_Inconsistent_Topic/descriptors/Plan.cdp:
          DDS4CCM used to create all extended and basic ports by default. Now that has changed, some tests
          log errors since they do expect a publisher or subscriber. Since these DDS entities are not there
          by default anymore, some tests had to be rewritten.
          Removed some unnecessary code.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/tests/PSLDeadline/Receiver/PSL_DeadlineTest_Receiver_exec.cpp:
          Optimized log output.

        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Base.cpp:
        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Base.h:

          New files, containing the parts of class
          Servant_Impl_Base (which is now derived from
          class Connector_Servant_Impl_Base) pertaining
          to facets and receptacles, since event sources
          and sinks are not allowed in connectors.

        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Utils_T.cpp:

          Similar split from Servant_Impl_Utils_T.cpp,
          containing static methods pertaining only to
          facets and receptacles.

          Other changes necessary to enable a connector
          to inherit from a smaller base class than a
          component, with no-ops for all inherited
          methods pertaining to event sources or sinks.
          The non-skeleton base class of Servant_Impl
          is now determined by a trait in the CONTEXT
          template parameter, which is set in generated
          code according to the type (component or connector)
          the servant is implementing.

        Changed implementation of deployment operations global to local entities
        (preparePlan, startLaunch etc.) to use a combination of AMH and AMI to
        make this part of the deployment fully asynchronous.
        The sequentiality of the operations is still maintained (i.e. a plan needs to
        be fully prepared before a launch operation can be started etc.).

          The CORBA representative of the DDS entities were passed to
          the underlying ports. There's no need to do that and so there's no
          need to keep these interfaces as a member in the proxy classes
          of the ports.
          We're now passing the proxies to the underlying implementation.

          Replaced the DataReader of the Getter when a
          contentfiltered topic is created by the Reader (i.e. the
          user creates a filter on the DataReader). Therefor
          the template arguments of the Reader should be
          extended with 'FIXED'. Because of that, several other
          template classes needed to be extended with this.
