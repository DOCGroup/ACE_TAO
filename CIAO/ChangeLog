          an unwanted *A.idl file. Some extra code generation
          also depends on the "#pragma ciao ami4ccm receptacle xxx"
          directive in this file.

          Added capability to pass selected instance naming context to
          LocalityManager, so non naming service enabled deployments
          won't stall out trying to resolve a naming server.

          Disabled temporarily as these aren't fixed yet, and it's making it
          difficult to read the scoreboard.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/examples/Large_Deployment/DDS_Pub/DDS_Pub.idl:
        * connectors/dds4ccm/examples/Large_Deployment/DDS_Sub/DDS_Sub.idl:

          Fixed incorrect IDL. References to DDS_Write, DDS_Listen and DDS_Get
          were incorrectly scoped inside the connector Large_Connector. They
          are actually defined in the instantiated template module
          LargeTypeConn.

        * MPC/config/dds4ccm_ts_default.mpb:

          Use a mapped keyword "dds_ts_flags" that's the same for any DDS
          implementation.  This would be used by projects for generic flags
          accepted by any of the code generators, such as -D and -I.

          It appears that when a contentfilteredTopic is created
          a new DataReader is created. The listening mask on this
          Reader contains a DDS_DATA_AVAILABLE-mask while it should
          use the mask which was originally set when the listener was set.

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp:

          Removed now-redundant check for non-local uses type in
          generation of connect_* methods.

Tue Apr 20 17:49:15 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp:

          Disabled generation of implied IDL operations for facets
          and receptacles if the underlying interface type is local.
          Ports using local interfaces are used only by the
          container, and not exposed to clients.

Tue Apr 20 09:47:50 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.mpc:

        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Base.cpp:
        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Base.h:

          Removed get_all_receptacles() and get_all_publishers(),
          since these methods are now always generated, except
          when the LwCCM flag is present.

Mon Apr 19 15:31:00 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp(visit_uses):

          Removed generation of the connect_* method if the uses type
          is a local interface. When compiling the generated *_IDL2.idl
          file, the IDL compiler will check arguments for a
          local/remote mismatch, so we skip this method (which takes
          the interface as an IN parameter) for now.

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.idl:

          Removed the comments around the 'local' qualifier of the
          interface which produced the error mentioned above.

Mon Apr 19 14:30:09 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp:

Fri Apr 16 20:29:16 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.mpc:

Fri Apr 16 20:20:07 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/be_sunsoft.cpp:

          Changes to reflect differences in IDL code generation
          from C++ generation, which was what this file was
          for in the original TAO_IDL backend.

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in code generation for the multiplex
          uses *Connection struct.

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.idl:

          Commented out the 'local' qualifier on an interface,
          temporarily until a design question involving our use
          in DDS3CCM of local interfaces in regular CORBA calls.
          The IDL compiler still flags this as illegal, and we
          get an actual error due to an implied IDL operation
          that contains the formerly local interface as a parameter.

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.mpc:

          Added new projects to convert KitchenSink.idl to IDL2,
          process that IDL, and compile the resulting C++.

Fri Apr 16 16:41:36 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp:

          Added missing code generation for a home's supported
          interfaces - as base interfaces of the explicit home
          interface. Also changed layout of code generated for
          component and explicit home equivalent interfaces.

Fri Apr 16 16:07:23 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.idl:

          Fixed bug where the uses multiple helper types
          struct xxxConnection and sequence xxxConnections
          were generated twice for connectors with uses
          multiple ports.

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL3_Plus/KitchenSink.idl:

          Changed names of ports in connector Comp2_T to follow
          the connector name.

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3p_checking_visitor.cpp:
        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3p_checking_visitor.h:

          New visitor that checks module scopes. If they
          contain only template module or porttype
          declarations, code generation for that module
          must be skipped, since it would be empty.

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/IDL3_to_IDL2.mpc:

          Added new files to project.

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/basic_visitor.h:

          Removed some pure virtual methods repeated from
          the ast_visitor base class.

        * tools/IDL3_to_IDL2/idl3_to_idl2_visitor.cpp(visit_module):

          Added creation and launch of the new visitor. When it's
          finished, a member flag is checked to see if code
          generation is necessary or not.

          in progress, some lwccm code uses methods from full ccm which
          means that code has to be rewritten to use other types. First step
          is to update all IDL and get code to compile to see what runs
          and what not

          When an extended port is partially or fully connected,
          all basic ports in this extended port are initialised.
          When an extended port is not connected. non of the basic
          ports will be connected.
          This means that the performance should increase and
          the usage of ports (and configuring them in the deployment
          plans) is more strict.

          DDS4CCM used to create all extended and basic ports by default. Now that has changed, some tests
          log errors since they do expect a publisher or subscriber. Since these DDS entities are not there
          by default anymore, some tests had to be rewritten.
          Removed some unnecessary code.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/tests/PSLDeadline/Receiver/PSL_DeadlineTest_Receiver_exec.cpp:
          Optimized log output.

        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Base.h:

          New files, containing the parts of class
          Servant_Impl_Base (which is now derived from
          class Connector_Servant_Impl_Base) pertaining
          to facets and receptacles, since event sources
          and sinks are not allowed in connectors.

        * ciao/Servants/Connector_Servant_Impl_Utils_T.cpp:

          Similar split from Servant_Impl_Utils_T.cpp,
          containing static methods pertaining only to

          Other changes necessary to enable a connector
          to inherit from a smaller base class than a
          component, with no-ops for all inherited
          methods pertaining to event sources or sinks.
          The non-skeleton base class of Servant_Impl
          is now determined by a trait in the CONTEXT
          template parameter, which is set in generated
          code according to the type (component or connector)
          the servant is implementing.

        The sequentiality of the operations is still maintained (i.e. a plan needs to
        be fully prepared before a launch operation can be started etc.).

Mon Mar 22 18:07:32 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * connectors/ami4ccm/examples/Hello/Base/Hello.mpc:

          Removed exec export macro and include from AMI_Hello_idl_gen
          project. The former was not used, probably intended to
          be used for the same thing as the lem stub export macro
          and include in AMI_Hello_lem_gen. This latter project had
          no command to actually generate the export header file,
          so -Gxhst was added to that project.

Mon Mar 22 17:44:03 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/dds/DataReaderStateListener_T.cpp:
          No return_loan was invoked when using ONE_BY_ONE mode. Therfor
          a precondition_not_met error was given when the datareader
          was removed.

          The CORBA representative of the DDS entities were passed to
          the underlying ports. There's no need to do that and so there's no
          need to keep these interfaces as a member in the proxy classes
          of the ports.
          We're now passing the proxies to the underlying implementation.

          user creates a filter on the DataReader). Therefor
          the template arguments of the Reader should be
          extended with 'FIXED'. Because of that, several other
          template classes needed to be extended with this.
