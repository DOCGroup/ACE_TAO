    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The DDS4CCM connector implements the DDS4LwCCM specification.<br/>
      DDS4CCM is part of CIAO and intergrates DDS into a Component based framework,
      which can be easily deployed, using DAnCE.<br/>
      For now, the DDS4CCM connector only supports
      <a href="http://www.rti.com/products/dds/index.html">RTI DDS</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Building and Installing DDS4CCM</h3>
    <p>First of all, be sure that CIAO is build and installed and functioning as
      expected (see <a href="../../CIAO-INSTALL.html">CIAO-INSTALL.html</a> on
      how to build and install CIAO).<br/>
      DDS4CCM uses DAnCE as deployement tool in all of the examples and tests.
      Therefor one should also be sure that DAnCE is build and installed
      in order to run the DDS4CCM examples.<br/><br/>
      But... before one builds and installs CIAO and DAnCE, one should
      first set the correct flags in the default.features and platform_macros.GNU.
    </p>
    <h4>Setting up default.features and platform_macros.GNU</h4>
    <p>Besided the flags needed to build ACE, TAO, CIAO, and, DAnCE, the following
      flags should be added for DDS4CCM.
    </p>
    <p>default.features should contain the following flags:<br/>
      <ul>
        <li><code>dds4ccm_ndds=1</code></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>platform_macros.GNU should contain the following flags:<br/>
      <ul>
        <li><code>ndds=1</code></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure that CIAO, DAnCE and DDS4CCM are build correctly, one might
      use the CIAO_TAO_DAnCE.mwc workspace.
    </p>

    <h3>Supported Platforms for DDS4CCM</h3>
    <p>DDS4CCM should be usable on all platforms that CIAO runs on.
