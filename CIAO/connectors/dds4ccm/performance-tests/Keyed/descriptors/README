These tests test the performance with different options.

-	test one publisher and one subscriber in 1 process:
	run_test.pl with resp. Plan.cdp


-	default test (RELIABLE) , separate publisher and  subscriber:
	run_pub.pl and run_sub.pl with resp. Plan_pub.cdp and Plan_sub.cdp .

-	test with one publisher and three separate subscribers:
	run_pub3.pl with Plan_pub3.cdp  and run_sub.pl, run_sub2.pl, run_sub3.pl all with Plan_sub.cdp .

-	BEST_EFFORT test, separate publisher and  subscriber:
	run_pub_BE.pl and run_sub_BE.pl with resp.  Plan_pub_BE.cdp and Plan_sub_BE.cdp .


To test changes in the next attributes, changes this values in the publisher cdp-files:
latency_count : indicates the number of messages minus 1 between two latency messages
iterations : the number of messages from one instance to send. 0 = INFINITY .
datalen: the datalen of a message (minimal 32).
sleep:  time in ms to sleep before writing the next message
spin: number of times to do a code loop before writing the next message, sleep has to be 0 .
keys: number of instances. (default 1) MORE THEN 1 NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
