Welcome to the latest release of The ACE ORB (TAO).  TAO is a freely
available, open-source implementation of a CORBA 3.x-compliant ORB

www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/TAO for more information on TAO
features, services, and the status of current work.  In addition,
document for TAO is available in the $TAO_ROOT/docs/ subdirectory in

We welcome suggestions for improvement, bug fixes, portability
enhancements, etc. and will strive to integrate correct bug fixes
quickly!  The current release has been tested extensively, but if you
find any bugs, please report them to the TAO github project
https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO using the $TAO_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM.
