CORBA Messaging


File: DevGuideExamples/Messaging/RelativeRoundtripTimeout/README


This directory contains an example illustrating the relative
round trip timeout policy defined in CORBA Messaging.

At each request invocation on the server, the client checks
against a user-specified timout value. If the time spent since
the start of the request exceeds the timeout value, a CORBA::TIMEOUT
exception is raised.

This example is based on the Messenger example in GettingStarted
directory.

Exeuction via Perl Script
