Portable Interceptors


File: DevGuideExamples/PortableInterceptor/SimpleCodec/README


This directory contains an example illustrating marshaling of data in
client and server Request Interceptors.

This example extends the authentication example in ../Auth. It is based on
the Messenger example in GettingStarted directory.  A message is
sent by MessengerClient and displayed by MessengerServer.  A client-side
portable interceptor adds an encoded (marshaled) GID to each request
sent to the server. A server-side interceptor verifies that the supplied
GID is valid.

How to Run
----------

To start the server:
------------------
./MessengerServer


To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient


Execution via Perl Script
-------------------------

A Perl script has been created to automate the steps shown
above.  This script can be run via the following command:

./run_test.pl
