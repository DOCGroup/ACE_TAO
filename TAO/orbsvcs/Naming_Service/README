This directory contains files that implement a server for the TAO
Naming Service.  In addition, it contains files that run the TAO
Naming Service as a Windows NT Service.  Both of these services are
described below.

How to Run the TAO Naming Service
=================================

The following describes how to run the TAO Naming Service.

1. Syntax

        % Naming_Service [-ORBNameServicePort nsport]
                         [-o ior_output_file]
                         [-p pid_file_name]
                         [-s context_size]
                         [-t time]
                         [-f persitence_file_name]
                         [-b base_address]
			 [-m (1=enable multicast(default),0=disable]

2. Optional Command-line Arguments

        -ORBNameServicePort nsport
                Multicast port for listening for requests from clients
                trying to bootstrap to a Naming Service through the
                use of multicast.

        -o ior_output_file
                The name of the file, in which to store the IOR of the
                root Naming Service context.

        -p pid_file_name
                The name of the file, in which to store the process id
                of the Naming Service server.

        -s context_size
                Size of the hash table allocated for the root Naming
                Context (if one is created).  All contexts created
                under the root will use the same size for their hash
                tables.  The default is 1024.

        -t time
                How long (in seconds) the server should listen for
                client requests before terminating.

        -f persistence_file_name
                The name of the file to use to store/retrieve
                persistent state of the Naming Service.  Without this
                option, Naming Service is started in non-persistent
                mode.

        -b base_address
                The address used for memory mapping the file specified
                with the "-f" option above.  The value supplied with
                this option is only used when the Naming Service runs
                in persistent mode, i.e., "-f" option is present.

	-m <0|1>
		By default the Naming Service will respond to
		multicast queries.  This is a non-standard but very
		simple way to discover the Naming Service in TAO.
		In real applications the multicast lookup mechanism
		can be innadequate, for example, if there are multiple
		naming services running on the network.
		In such cases the Interoperable Naming Service
		bootstrap options are a better choice.

3. Environment Variables

        NameServicePort
                Multicast port for listening for requests from clients
                trying to bootstrap to a Naming Service through the
                use of multicast.

4. Persistence

        TAO Naming Service has an optional persistence capability.  By
        default, the Naming Service is started in a non-persistent
        mode.  Supplying "-f" command-line option to the server causes
        a persistent version of the Naming Service to run.

        The file specified with the "-f" option is used to store the
        persistent state of the Naming Service, i.e., all Naming
        Contexts and their bindings.  When "-f" option is specified:

        1. If the specified file does not exist, it is created and
           used to store the state of the Naming Service.  An initial
           (root) Naming Context is also created.

        2. If the specified file exists, it is scanned and:

                a) If any inconsistency is detected in the stored
                state, or the file is not recognized by the Naming
                Service, the server exits.  (This may happen, for
                example, if a server or host crashed in the middle of
                writing a record to this file on a previous run).  A
                noncorrupted version of the file must be used instead.

                b) If the file is recognized and is ok, the state
                stored in the file becomes the current state of the
                Naming Service.

        Internally, TAO uses memory mapped file to implement
        persistence feature of the Naming Service.  A default memory
        address (ACE_DEFAULT_BASE_ADDR) is used for mapping the file.
        Alternate mapping address can be specified at compile-time by
        redefining TAO_NAMING_BASE_ADDR in tao/orbconf.h.  Alternate
        mapping address can also be specified at run-time
        with the "-b" command-line option, which takes precedence over
        TAO_NAMING_BASE_ADDR definition.
        NOTE: Naming Service stores absolute pointers in its
        memory-mapped file.  Therefore, it is important to use the
        same mapping address on each run for the same persistence file.


5. Implementation Policies

        a. Destroying Binding Iterators

                A binding iterator is destroyed when client invokes
                <destroy> operation either on the iterator itself or
                on the naming context it is iterating over.  In both
                cases, subsequent calls on the binding iterator object
                will cause OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception.

        b. Dealing with orphaned contexts

                This implementation of the Naming Service does not
                include any form of 'garbage collection' for orphaned
                naming contexts.  It is solely the responsibility of
                clients to clean up after themselves and not leak
                server resources.  All the resources, including
                orphaned contexts, are released during the Naming
                Server shutdown.

6. Clients: ways to bootstrap to the Naming Service:

        There are several methods for a client to bootstrap to a
        Naming Service, i.e., there are several mechanisms
        <resolve_initial_references> can use when asked for
        "NameService".

        1. Multicast

                By default (unless other options are specified - see
                items 2 and 3 below), ip multicast is used to locate a
                Naming Service. TAO Naming Server is listening for
                client multicast requests on a specified port.  On the
                client side, <resolve_initial_references> sends out a
                multicast request on the network, trying to locate a
                Naming Service.  When a Naming Server receives a
                multicast request from a client, it replies to the
                sender with the ior of its root Naming Context.  Note,
                the port used for this bootstrapping process, i.e.,
                'multicast port', has nothing to do with the ORB port
                used for CORBA communication.  Other points worth
                mentioning:

                - A client and a server will only click through this
                  multicast protocol if they are using the same
                  multicast port.  For both client and server
                  -ORBnameserviceport command-line option and
                  NameServicePort environment variable can be used to
                  specify the multicast port to use.  If none is
                  specified, the default port is used.  (The ability
                  to specify multicast ports can be used to match
                  certain clients with certain Naming Servers, when
                  there are more than one Naming Server running on the
                  network).

                - If there are several Naming Servers running on the
                  network, each listening on the same port for
                  multicast requests, each will send a reply to a
                  client's request.  The client's orb will use the
                  first response it receives, so the Naming Service
                  will, in fact, be selected at random.

                Since this mechanism is proprietary to TAO (i.e.,
                non-standard), it only works when both client and
                server are written using TAO.  There is no way to turn
                multicasting off, but it is used only as a last
                resort, i.e., any of the options below will override
                it.

                When OS platform doesn't support multicast, or client
                or server isn't written using TAO, or a more reliable
                location method is desired, etc., one of the options
                below can be used to bootstrap to the Naming Service.

        2. Command-line options

                The "-ORBInitRef NameService=IOR:..." or environment
                variable NameServiceIOR can be used on the client side
                to specify the object that the call to
                <resolve_initial_references> should return to the
                client.  (On the server side, -o option can be used to
                get the ior).

                Example (Unix, same host):

                        % TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service -o ior_file
                        % my_client -ORBInitRef NameService=file://ior_file

                        On the first line, we start the Naming
                        Service, and output its ior to <ior_file>.  On
                        the second line, we start some client, and
                        specify the ior <resolve_initial_references>
                        should return for the Naming Service in a file
                        format.

        3. Interoperable Naming Service.

                TAO implements the standard CORBA Interoperable Naming
                Service (ING).  Therefore, most initialization options
                provided by INS can be used to bootstrap to the Naming
                Service (see TAO's releasenotes for the status of INS
                implementation).

How to use the NT_Naming_Service
================================

To set the options for the TAO Naming Sevice, go to the Services icon
in the Settings group under the start menu (start menu -> settings ->
services).  There, highlight the NT_Naming_Service, which is the name
used by the Naming Service when it is registered.  After it's
highlighted, you should see at the bottom of the dialog box an area to
specify options.  Just enter the options you wish in that edit box and
everything should just work.  However, some options, such as
-ORBDebugLevel, won't work since an NT service can't write output to
standard out.

1. Syntax

        % NT_Naming_Server [-i value]
                           [-r]
                           [-s]
                           [-k]
                           [-t n]
                           [-d]

2. Optional Command-line Arguments

        -i value
                Install this program as an NT service, with specified startup

        -r
                Remove this program from the Service Manager
        -s
                Start the service

        -k
                Kill the service

        -t value
                Set startup for an existing service

        -d
                Debug; run as a regular application

3. Usage

        To see different stages of an NT service application, you have
        to run the program several times, with different options.
        Please note: run with only one option at a time.

        a. First, you must initialize the service in the NT SCM
           database.  Run NT_Naming_Service with -in, where n is one of
           the following startup options:

           // Start Type (from WinNT.h)
           //
           #define SERVICE_SYSTEM_START    0x00000001
           #define SERVICE_AUTO_START      0x00000002
           #define SERVICE_DEMAND_START    0x00000003
           #define SERVICE_DISABLED        0x00000004

           If only -i is specified, SERVICE_AUTO_START is default option.

        b. Now you are ready to run the actual service. Run
           NT_Naming_Service again, this time with -s option. If the
           service starts successfully, it will ring the system
           bell every second or so until the service is stopped.

        c. To stop service execution, run NT_Naming_Service with the
           -k option.

        d. To remove the service from the Service Control Manager
           database, run NT_Naming_Service with -r.

        In addition, once you have initialized this service (by using
        the -i option) you can change its startup type to one of the
        other values above.  To do this, run NT_Naming_Service with
        -tn option. n is as explained above for -i.

        In order to debug the service's execution itself, use the -d
        option.
