Notification Service examples:

This directory has examples to illustrate how to use the Notification Service

Examples:

Filter: A simple example to how how to do filtering of events.
------
An event passing through the channel encounters filters at the proxy,
admin and channel level.This example shows how to setup filters and use them.

Subscribe: A simple example to show how to specify subscription constraints.
---------
This example does not add any filters to keep the example simple.
If filters are added, then they would be evaluated *after* the event type
constraints have been met.
Thus subscriptions are a way of provide coarse grain filtering.
