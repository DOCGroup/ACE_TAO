Description:

	This is a simple test for SSLIOP, it sends a file,
line-per-line to the server, using truss we can take a look at the
buffers and verify that they are giberish.

Expected output:
	The server prints out the IOR of the object it serves. Later
it prints all the lines sent by the client.  The client shouldn't
print out anything, it returns 0 on success.

How to run:

# Setup the environment and add the fake CA to your trusted list:
$ SSL_CERT_FILE=cacert.pem
$ export SSL_CERT_FILE

	Now run the simplest test:

# Run the server
$ server -ORBSvcConf server_nopasswd.conf -o test.ior

# Run the client
$ client -ORBSvcConf client_nopasswd.conf -k file://test.ior < myfile

	notice that this test uses unsecure private key files.  This
could be appropriate if the keys are kept is a very trusted system,
but usually you will want to use a pass phrase protected key:

$ server -ORBSvcConf server.conf -o test.ior
$ client -ORBSvcConf client.conf -k file://test.ior < myfile

	In this case both the client and the server ask for the pass
phrase (it is 'test').

======= Testing IIOP interoperability

	We also want to verify that the client and server (assuming
	"-SSLNoProtection" flag is set in server's `server.conf' file)
	can interoperate with regular IIOP servers and clients.
	First setup a pure IIOP server:

$ server -o test.ior
$ client -ORBSvcConf client.conf -k file://test.ior < myfile

	next a pure IIOP client (assuming "-SSLNoProtection" flag is
        set in server's `server.conf' file):

$ server -ORBSvcConf server.conf -o test.ior
$ client -k file://test.ior < myfile

	and finally both are pure IIOP:

$ server -o test.ior
$ client -k file://test.ior < certificate.pem

======= Testing failed authentications:

	To test failed server authentications we simply run the client
and server as indicated below, but we enter invalid pass phrases in
the client and/or server.

$ server -ORBSvcConf server.conf -o test.ior
$ client -ORBSvcConf client.conf -k file://test.ior < myfile

======= Testing connections without client authentication:

	We run the server and client as follows:

$ server -ORBSvcConf server_none.conf -o test.ior
$ client -ORBSvcConf client.conf -k file://test.ior < myfile
