                        ===================

This is an implementation of the telecom log service.
Currently we support the DsLogAdmin interface.

The idl spec is $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsLogAdmin.idl

The example in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/examples/Log/Client demonstrates a simple
usage of the Log service.

The Log Service implementation is in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log
