Event Notification Service


File: examples/NotifyService/OfferSubscriptions/README


This example extends the NotifyService/Messenger example by incorporating
"offers" and "subscriptions" into the utilization of the Notification
channel.

The publication of "offers" by a supplier, informs consumers of the
Notification channel about the types of events it will be producing.  This
is accomplished via the 'offer_change()' operation.

Moreover, the example demonstrates how consumers can inform Notification
channel suppliers about the types of events in which they are interested.
The set of events in which a consumer is interested is called a "subscription"
and can be communicated via the 'subscription_change()' operation.



The Client code is stored in:

examples/NotifyService/OfferSubscriptions/MessengerClient.cpp

The Server code is stored in:

examples/NotifyService/OfferSubscriptions/MessengerServer.cpp

The Consumer code is stored in:

examples/NotifyService/OfferSubscriptions/MessengerConsumer.cpp
