This test verifies the proper behavior of the -ORBListenerInterfaces option on IPv4 and IPv6 with values *=ip_addr,
*=interface_name, and CopyPreferredInterfaces. The latter requires also using the -ORBPreferredInterface option.
It does so by doing the following:

1. Calling the local helper utility if_addrs_helper to determine the system name of the loopback interface and
   ethernet-like interface(s) with routable IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, as well as the correct IP addresses for those
   interfaces.

2. Creating a matrix of tests across these interfaces, IP addresses, and the *=ip_addr, *=interface_name, and
   CopyPreferredInterfaces option values.

3. Executing the matrix of tests and asserting a specific failure (but no other failures) for loopback interfaces and
   no failures for non-loopback interfaces. Specifically, for loopback interfaces, the server process should never
   receive the instruction to shut down from the client, and so the test should time out waiting on the server process
   and elect to kill it.
