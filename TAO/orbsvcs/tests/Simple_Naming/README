This application tests different features of TAO's Naming Service.

To run all tests automatically -
	execute Perl script run_test.pl

To run tests manually -
	start Naming Service ($TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service),
	 then run ./client with one of the following options below.

The following options exist:

-s	Run the Simple test of the Naming Service.

-t  	Run the Tree test of the Naming Service.

-e	Run the Exceptions test of the Naming Service

-i 	Run the Iterator test of the Naming Service.

-y      Run the Destroy test of the Naming Service.

-m      Run the MT test of the Naming Service.  Requires integer
        argument specifying number of thread to spawn.  (If running
        this test manually, its output should be redirected to some
        file, say, "foo".  Then, process-m-output.pl script can be
        used to analyze the test output and print out a diagnostic
        message.  Invoke the script with
        "process-m-output.pl foo number_of_threads", where
        <number_of_threads> is the argument that was supplied with "-m"
        option to the client.)

If no option is specified, Simple test is run.  If more than one
option is specified, only one test runs.

NOTE: if running tests manually, Naming Service has to be restarted
before each test (this is due to some tests not 'cleaning up' bindings
after themselves).

NOTE: destroy test will not produce desired output if POA 'recreates
servants on request'.

DESCRIPTION AND EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR EACH TEST
*******************************************

Simple Test.

Performs bind (), resolve (), and unbind () of an object reference in
the root context.

Expected Output:

Bound name OK
Resolved name OK
Unbound name OK

********************************************

MT Test.

Spawns a specified number of threads.  Threads concurrently attempt to
bind (), resolve (), and unbind () the object reference.

Expected Output (produced by the output processing script):

Multithreaded output is ok
*******************************************

Tree Test.

Checks all Naming Service functions with a tree of Naming Contexts.

root->bind_new_context (level1)

new = root->new_context (), new->bind (foo, obj), and
  root->bind_context (level1/level2, new)

We now have root->level1->level2->foo

root->resolve (level1/level2/foo).
root->unbind (level1/level2/foo).
root->bind (level1/level2/foo, obj).

new = root->new_context()
root->rebind_context(level1/level2, new)

root->bind (level1/level2/foo obj)
root->resolve (level1/level2/foo)
root->rebind (level1/level2/foo, obj2) to have a different object under the name bar.
root->resolve (level1/level2/foo) to make sure correct reference is returned.


Expected Output:

All funtions work properly
********************************************

Exceptions Test.

Makes sure that Naming Service throws exceptions as expected, and data
inside exceptions is set correctly.

Create a tree of Naming Contexts: root context -> level1 -> level2.

Bind an object with the name foo into each of the Naming Contexts.

root->resolve () (with a Name of length 0) - should get InvalidName exception.
root->bind (foo, obj) - should get AlreadyBound exception.
root->bind (level1/foo, obj) - should get AlreadyBound exception.
root->unbind (level1/level2/bar) - should get NotFound exception
  with why = not_object, rest_of_name = bar.
root->unbind (level1/level3/foo) - should get NotFound exception
  with why = missing_node, rest_of_name = level3/foo.
root->unbind (level1/foo/foo) -should get NotFound exception
  with why = not_context, rest_of_name = foo/foo.


Expected Output:

AlreadyBound exception (case 1) works properly
AlreadyBound  exception (case 2) works properly
NotFound  exception (case 1) works properly
NotFound  exception (case 2) works properly
NotFound  exception (case 3) works properly

*********************************************

Iterator Test.

Checks iterator functions.

Bind () objects with the following names foo1, foo2, foo3, and foo4
into the root Naming Context.

root->lists (1, bl, iter)
iter->next_one ()
iter->next_n (2, bl)
iter->next_one () - should return false
iter->destroy ()


Expected Output:

First binding: foo1
Second binding: foo2
Third binding: foo3
Fourth binding: foo4

*********************************************

Destroy Test.

Makes sure destroy method is working properly.

Create a context and bind an object under it.
Attempt to destroy the context - NotEmpty exception should be raised.

Unbind the object and call destroy on the context.
Attempt to call destroy on the object again - OBJECT_NOT_EXIST
exception should be raised.


Expected Output:

NotEmpty exception works properly
Destroy works properly
