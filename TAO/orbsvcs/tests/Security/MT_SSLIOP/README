Description:

This is a simple test for a thread-pool server that can
service multithreaded clients with the same object reference.
It creates a server process with a variable number of threads,
multiple (multithreaded) clients can send requests to it, the
requests are handled in different threads.

Expected output:

The server prints the thread that handles each request. The Client
prints the Validation info as well as the  thread pid and iteration
number.

How to run:
Use the run_test.pl.

For SSL:
   Key and certificated are copied from the Security/cert directory
   Pvt Key File ( RSA ) = server_key.pem
   Self Signed Certificate = server_cert.pem

   ORB Svc Conf File for Server = server.conf
   ORB Svc Conf File for Client = client.conf
