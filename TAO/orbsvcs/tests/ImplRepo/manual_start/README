This test demonstrates that a client attempting to contact a stopped MANUAL server will
not lock up the ImR. The test starts primary and backup Locators, then registers and
starts a server with MANUAL activation mode. The server connects to the locator then
shuts down. Next a client is started that attempts to contact the server via the locator.
Since this is a disallowed implicit activation, a TRANSIENT exception is raised. The
client tries again via the backup IMR. At this point the IMR would hang due to a retained
server accessor in an inactive but final state. The fixed IMR continues to operate normally.
