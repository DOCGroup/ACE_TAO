<h2>Implementation Repository in TAO</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Implementation Repository in TAO is for the automatic
activation of a TAO server when a method is invoked but the server is not
running. It does this by working with the server to keep track of when it is
activated and stores information on how to reactivate it.&nbsp; Method
invocations on the server will actually be sent to the Implementation
Repository, which will then be able to start the server process if it is not
already running and forward the invocation to the real server. </p>

<p>In the pages here (and in most of the documentation written for it),
Implementation Repository will often be shortened to ImplRepo or IR.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The IR in TAO was first based on a paper on the subject by <a href="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi-henning.html">Michi
Henning</a> called <a href="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi/cacm.pdf">Binding,
Migration, and Scalability in CORBA</a>.&nbsp; Mr. Henning later went on to
coauthor the book <a href="http://cseng.awl.com/bookdetail.qry?ISBN=0-201-37927-9&amp;ptype=0">Advanced
CORBA Programming in C++</a> and included a chapter on the Implementation
Repository.&nbsp; The description of the IR in this chapter is used as the
specification for TAO's IR.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="usersguide.html">Users Guide</a> - Overall documentation on
how to use the IR in your programs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="paper.html">The Paper</a> - A paper that has a general
description of the IR. This is also where to look to find information on the
inner working of the IR.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>A large part of the IR has been implemented, but there are several areas that
are not finished or complete yet.</p>

<h3>Who wrote it?</h3>
<p>The guy currently in charge of the IR is&nbsp; Darrell Brunsch &lt;<a href="mailto:brunsch@cs.wustl.edu">brunsch@cs.wustl.edu</a>&gt;.
You can reach me by either email (which is better), or through the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE
mailing list</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:ace-useres@cs.wustl.edu">ace-users@cs.wustl.edu</a>&gt;,
or through the <a href="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">comp.soft-sys.ace</a> newsgroup.
The newsgroup mirrors the mailing list, but not the other way. Also, if you use
the mailing list, it is best if you join it before sending a question since
responses are usually just replied back to the group.</p>
