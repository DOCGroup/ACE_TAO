<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>This document describes the proposed design of the TAO
Implementation Repository, which was originally known as the
reactivator/activation service. If you have any questions or
comments on our design, please post them to the <a
href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE</a>
mailing list &lt;<a href="mailto:ace-useres@cs.wustl.edu">ace-users@cs.wustl.edu</a>&gt;
or send email to Darrell Brunsch &lt;<a
href="mailto:brunsch@cs.wustl.edu">brunsch@cs.wustl.edu</a>&gt;.</p>

<h3><a name="PersistentandTransientIORs">Persistent and Transient
IORs</a></h3>

<p>CORBA defines two types of object references: <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/C++-report-col12.ps.gz">persistent
and transient</a>. The difference between the two stems from the
lifetime of the reference in relation to the lifetime of the
server process that created it. The lifetime of a transient
object reference is limited to the lifetime of its server
process. Once the server process exits the transient object
reference no longer exists. All references to this object should
now be invalid, even if the server is restarted. In contrast,
persistent object references can outlive their originating server
process. Therefore, the server can exit and be restarted without
invalidating its persistent object references. This enables the
implementation of features like automatic server activation and
object migration.</p>

<p>Note that both persistent and transient object references can
refer to objects that reside in <em>manually activated</em>
servers, <em>i.e.</em>, the so-called ``persistent servers.'' A
persistent server is a server that is launched manually, <em>i.e.</em>,
it is always running. A persistent server can generate transient
references and/or persistent references. </p>

<p>Developers should be aware that persistence of the object
reference does not imply any persistence on the object
implementation state. It is certainly possible to provide
persistent object references for objects whose state is not
persistent. Therefore, servant implementors are responsible for
preserving the state of their servants, <em>e.g.</em>, using a
database or file. </p>

<h3><a name="TheImplementationRepository">The Implementation
Repository</a></h3>

<p>According to the CORBA specification, &quot;The Implementation
Repository contains information that allows the ORB to locate and
activate implementations of objects&quot; [CORBA Spec Rev. 2.2:
2.1.14] In earlier revisions of the specification, there was a
method <code>get_implementation</code> in the CORBA Object
interface. This has been deprecated as of the CORBA 2.2
specification, leaving both the interface and implementation of
the Implementation Repository to the ORB vendor.</p>

<p>A good paper describing the functionality of the CORBA
Implementation Repository is &quot;<a
href="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi/cacm.pdf">Binding,
Migration, and Scalability in CORBA</a>&quot; [Michi Henning].
This paper describes the following three functions of the
Implementation Repository: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Maintain a registry of known servers.</li>
    <li>Record which server is currently running, and which port
        and host it uses.</li>
    <li>Starts servers on demand if they are registered with the
        Implementation Repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>The TAO Implementation Repository is based on the design in
this paper. He also wrote an earlier <a
href="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi/binding.txt">email</a>
that may be useful to see the issues involved. The next section
details our goals and plans for the implementation.</p>

<h2><a name="TAOsImplementationRepository">TAO's Implementation
Repository</a></h2>

<p>The following is an brief outline of TAO'S Implementation
Repository. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Use of TAO's Implementation Repository will be optional.
        Real-time applications can choose not to use the
        Implementation Repository according to their
        performance/predictability/footprint requirements.</li>
    <li>Use of TAO's Implementation Repository will be invisible
        to clients and servers for common use-case. For more
        complicated behavior, programs can use Implementation
        Repository extensions of the POA.</li>
    <li>TAO's Implementation Repository will work with any CORBA
        client that supports <code>LOCATION_FORWARD</code> IIOP
        messages and multiple profiles in IORs, even if the
        client is not implemented using TAO.</li>
    <li>TAO's Implementation Repository will know if one of the
        servers registered with it is running by the use of a
        &quot;ping&quot;-like service in the server. This service
        allows the Implementation Repository to know when it
        should restart the server.</li>
    <li>TAO will be fork-safe. Since there will be an open
        connection to the client while the server is restarted
        (via fork or CreateProcess) then care will be needed to
        make sure that the open sockets will be closed in the
        client process. The addition of CLOEXEC feature to TAO
        will cover this problem.</li>
    <li>TAO will exploit features of IIOP 1.1 to safely and
        efficiently verify if an IOR was generated by TAO itself
        on the client side. The server will still determine this
        through the object key, since that is all that is passed
        in a request.</li>
    <li>TAO will support multiple profiles in IORs. A profile
        contains the host/port and object key of a CORBA Object.
        An optimization that will be possible is to have a last
        known profile of the object as the first profile and an
        Implementation Repository as the second profile in an
        IOR. The client will first try the object to see if it
        still active at the host/port before it contacts the
        Implementation Repository. This strategy will reduce
        latency. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="VirtualServers">Virtual Servers</a></h3>

<p>TAO's Implementation Repository must keep track of whether an
object's implementation is currently running or is stopped. To
have a record for every object would require too much overhead,
but having a record for every executable server would be
inflexible and prevent the migration of objects. In the Henning
paper, he mentions the use of a <em>server name</em> as the index
for the table maintained by the Implementation Repository. </p>

<p>A virtual server does not refer to the executable but instead
to a group of objects. An executable may have one or more virtual
servers within it. This allows one virtual server to be moved off
the executable to another executable (for instance, onto another
machine) without affecting the objects in other virtual servers
on the original executable. </p>

<p>Each virtual server will be indexed in the Implementation
Repository by a name that is given to it by the user. It is the
users responsibility to make sure that each virtual server name
is unique. By default, this name is the name of the executable
(since by default there is only one virtual server per
executable). However, this default behavior can be overridden. </p>

<h3><a name="PingObject">Ping Object</a></h3>

<p>Ping objects are simple objects that reside in the server, one
for every virtual server. It is contacted by the Implementation
Repository to determine if the virtual server is still running
and responding. At certain intervals the Implementation
Repository will invoke a one-way method on the ping object, and
then will expect a &quot;pong&quot; message to be sent back.
Different strategies for pinging (which will depend on a TAO
option) will be used by the implementation repository. If a
server is expected to be responsive, the Implementation
Repository will not wait long for a response before considering
the server to be gone. Other servers may be
computationally-intensive and need to be held under less
stringent expectations.</p>

<p>We chose the ping method to be a one-way (instead of two-way)
because if the server became unresponsive, it would not return
from the method invocation. The Implementation Repository needs
some form of a timeout with the ping to be able to determine if
the server is unresponsive or not.</p>

<h3><a name="NewIORs">New IORs</a></h3>

<p>Standard CORBA IORs contain the following two sections:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>Type ID</td>
        <td>Sequence of Tagged Profiles</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The Type ID is an indicator for the most derived type known at
the time of the reference creation. It is used as a hint for the
client in determining what interfaces the object can support. The
Sequence of Tagged Profiles consist of one or more profiles that
encapsulate information used by the associated protocol in order
to communicate with the object (host, port, object id, etc.).</p>

<p>Currently, TAO uses only one IIOP 1.0 Tagged Profile, which is
defined as follows:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>Version</td>
        <td>Host</td>
        <td>Port</td>
        <td>Object Key</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td>Object Key: </td>
        <td><table border="1">
            <tr>
                <td>Transient/Persistent Flag</td>
                <td>TimeStamp</td>
                <td>POA ID</td>
                <td>OBJ ID</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>To accomodate the Implementation Repository and IIOP 1.1, the
Profile was changed according to the CORBA specification as
follows:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>Version</td>
        <td>Host</td>
        <td>Port</td>
        <td>Object Key</td>
        <td>Components</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td>Object Key: </td>
        <td><table border="1">
            <tr>
                <td>TAO</td>
                <td>TAO version</td>
                <td>TimeStamp/Server Name</td>
                <td>POA ID</td>
                <td>OBJ ID</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The two main changes is the addition of the Components field
(which is a IIOP 1.1 thing) and the addition of TAO with its
version. Transient object references will still have a TimeStamp
to ensure uniqueness, but persistent object references will have
a server name to identify themselves to the Implementation
Repository.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For servers that move around or need to be restarted often,
the IOR will contain a reference to the Implementation Repository
with the object key of the server and the server name imbedded.
&nbsp; Once the client contacts the Implementation Repository, it
will be forwarded to the correct object. This IOR will look like
the following:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>Version</td>
        <td>Host</td>
        <td>Port</td>
        <td>Object Key</td>
        <td>Components</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td>Object Key: </td>
        <td><table border="1">
            <tr>
                <td>TAO</td>
                <td>TAO version</td>
                <td>Server Name</td>
                <td>POA ID</td>
                <td>OBJ ID (actually the OBJ Key of the Server)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>For servers that expect to remain in the same host/port for a
long time, the above IOR can be optimized by placing the server
profile in the IOR before the Implementation Repository
profile.&nbsp; TAO clients will first try the server, and if that
fails, then try the Implementation Repository.&nbsp; Clients from
other ORBs may behave the same way, but this isn't guaranteed
since the handling of multiple profiles is not yet in the CORBA
spec. There will be an option to only generate the IR-only IORs
for ORBs that do not support multiple profiles in the needed
manner. </p>

<p>There will be a POA policy to determine which type of
Persistent IOR to use.&nbsp; By default, the Implementation
Repository alone version will be used.</p>

<h4><a name="WhatwaswrongwiththeoldIOR">What was wrong with the
old IOR?</a></h4>

<p>We need a place to put a TAO marker in the IOR so TAO servers
can differentiate TAO IORs from IORs of other vendors. In the
original scheme used in TAO, Persistent IORs had a null
timestamp. To support virtual servers, we will use that slot to
store the server name so the Implementation Repository knows
which server to launch.</p>

<h4><a name="WhydoesImplRepocontainanOBJKey">Why does the
Implementation Repository profile contain an Object Key?</a></h4>

<p>It needs to know what the object key of the object when
forwarding is used. A server may contain more than one object, so
the object key is needed to forward to the correct object on the
server. </p>

<h3><a name="POAExtensions">POA Extensions</a></h3>

<p>TAO's POA will contain a new TAO-specific method called <code>create_reference_with_virtual_server[_and_id]
(...)</code>. This method takes additional arguments for a
virtual server name and a sequence of Implementation Repository
IORs. The POA will register the virtual server name with each of
the Implementation Repositories in the sequence passed in.
Several Implementation Repositories can be specified to enhance
availability through redundancy. </p>

<p>TAO's POA will also contain a policy for the type of IOR
created with <code>create_reference</code>. &nbsp; It can either
produce the standard type, with just a reference to the
Implementation Repository, or it can produce one also containing
a reference to the current server.</p>

<h3><a name="PossibleFutureGoals">Possible Future Goals</a></h3>

<p>The following are features that may be added to support TAO's
Implementation Repository: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Optimization on TAO clients to recognize when a server is
        restarted, and change all other IORs that contain the
        server instead of going through the Implementation
        Repository</li>
    <li>Some sort of server security that checks the executable
        to make sure it is the correct executable (checksum,
        signatures, etc).</li>
    <li>Add the ability to put servers into DLLs or Shared Object
        files so the Implementation Repository can load it via
        those methods.</li>
    <li>GUI interface for such things as the helper application.</li>
    <li>Federations of Implementation Repositories.</li>
    <li>The ability to start a remote server (possibly with rsh,
        ssh, rexec, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ServerRestrictions">Server Restrictions</a></h3>

<p>Most often servers that have Persistent IORs will save their
state to secondary storage. Databases are a good example of this,
where the server can be stopped and restarted with all the
information remaining on disk. </p>

<p>The server must also make sure it creates the POA and Object
in a way that does not change the POA ID and Object ID. The
Implementation Repository forwards requests based on the
information in the IOR; if the POA ID or Object ID changes, then
the Implementation Repository will be unable to sucessfully
forward requests. If the server implements dynamic servants and
dynamic POA activations, then this is not an issue since the
necessary POAs and servants will be created on demand.</p>

<h3><a name="PreliminaryInterface">Preliminary Interface</a></h3>

<p>The following is a proposed IDL interface for the TAO
Implementation Repository: </p>

<pre>module TAO

<h2><a name="AlternateImplementations">Alternate Implementations</a></h2>

<p>Other ORB vendors use alternative techniques for their
Implementation Repositories. These techniques usually require new
naming techniques to access persistent object references and new
client-side APIs to bind to persistent object references. TAO's
Implementation Repository will not require such extensions. </p>

<p>A possible design alternative for the IR might use an Object
Reference that points to the Implementation Repository instead of
pointing directly to the persistent object. This extra level of
indirection would be used by the Implementation Repository to
start the server, if needed. The Location Forwarding mechanism
would then be used to forward the client request to the server.
The difference between this design and TAO's design is that the
persistent IOR in TAO will contain a profile pointing to a
location of the server (where it still might be running) to try
first, and then only if that fails does the client contact the
Implementation Repository. This is an optimization for case where
the server does not shut down often, and most requests do not
need to be forwarded to a new address.</p>

<p>In cases where most requests will require a forward, TAO can
support a policy that is just like this alternative, where the
Implmentation Repository will be contacted first.</p>

<h2><a name="AccessingtheImplementationRepository">Accessing the
Implementation Repository</a> </h2>

<p>The Implementation Repository will be transparent to the
clients and the servers. Clients will only deal with IIOP 1.1
IORs, and in the default case all the Implementation Repository
logic on the server side will be handled internally by the ORB
and the POA. </p>

<h3><a name="HelperApplication">Helper Application</a></h3>

<p>A helper application will be included with the Implementation
Repository. It will be a command-line utility that will assist
users with adding and removing server records (containing virtual
server names and executable name/options) from the Implementation
Repository. </p>

<h3><a name="LocatinganinstanceofImplRepo">Locating an Instance
of the Implementation Repository </a></h3>

<h4><a name="Serverside">Server-side</a></h4>

<p>In the default case, the Implementation Repository will be
found via the command-line, environment variables, and multicast
(in that order). This location strategy is consistent with that
used by TAO to local its default Naming Service instance. Using
the POA extensions, other Implementation Repositories can be
specified in the call to <code>POA::create_reference_with_virtual_server</code>.
The default port of the Implementation Repository can be
overridden through command-line options or environment variables.
</p>

<h4><a name="Clientside">Client-side</a></h4>

<p>One or more Implementation Repositories will be stored in
additional profiles in the IOR. Other Implementation Repositories
can also be located by multicasting (on a default multicast
group) the server name of the Persistent Object the client is
interested in. The default multicast group and default port of
the Implementation Repository can be overridden through command
line options or environment variables. </p>

<p>In most cases, one Implementation Repository will be enough.
For redundancy, several Implementation Repositories can be
specified.</p>

<h2><a name="Howitworks">How It Works</a></h2>

<h3><a name="HowServerProducesPersistentIORdefault">How a server
produces a Persistent IOR (in the default case)</a></h3>

<p>Before a server starts, it must be registered (via a
command-line utility) with an implementation repository. On
platforms that don't support multicast, the Implementation
Repository must be specified on the command line or in an
environment variable. </p>

<ol>
    <li>When the server starts up it calls <code>ORB_init</code>.
        <code>ORB_init</code>, if not passed a server name, will
        take argv[0] and use that as a default server name (TAO
        expects this to be the executable name). </li>
    <li><code>ORB_init</code> will create a ping object.</li>
    <li><code>ORB_init</code> will look for Implementation
        Repositories on the command-line, environmental
        variables, and then through multicast (in that order).
        Once it finds one it registers itself and passes the ping
        object to the implementation repository with <code>server_is_running</code>
        operation. </li>
    <li>The profile returned by registration will be stored for
        later use.</li>
    <li>Client later can call the <code>POA::create_reference</code>
        operation.</li>
    <li>The <code>create_reference</code> operation will create
        the local profile.</li>
    <li>The stored Implementation Repository profile will have
        its object id changed to be the object key just created.</li>
    <li>Both profiles will be joined together if the multiple
        profile IOR policy is set, and then returned.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="HowServerProducesPersistentIORcomplex">How a server
produces a Persistent IOR (in complex cases)</a></h3>

<p>As with the default case, the server must be registered with
an Implementation Repository, although it does not need to be
multicast aware since the IORs will be passed to the POA by the
program. </p>

<ol>
    <li><code>ORB_init</code> is called and does the default work
        (if it has Implementation Repositories to contact).</li>
    <li><code>POA::create_reference_with_virtual_server[_and_id]</code>
        will be called with a server name and list of
        Implementation Repositories. </li>
    <li>The profile for the object is created.</li>
    <li>The ping object created in <code>ORB_init</code> and the
        object key is passed to the Implementation Repositories,
        and their profiles are returned.</li>
    <li>Both profiles will be joined together if the multiple
        profile IOR policy is set, and then returned.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="HowClientUsesPersistentIOR">How a client uses a
Persistent IOR</a></h3>

<p>For all Clients: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Client obtains a Persistent Object Reference, which
        contains multiple profiles to both regular objects and
        Implementation Repositories.</li>
    <li>It will now make a request on the first profile.</li>
    <li>If the first profile if the server profile, and the
        server is still there, then it will be successful.&nbsp;
        If the server has moved (or shut down), then the next
        profile will be tried.</li>
    <li>If the first profile is the Implementation Repository, or
        if the server profile failed, then it will be
        contacted.&nbsp; The Implemenation Repository will then
        return NOT_FOUND or will start up the server and return a
        Location Forward message.</li>
</ul>

<p>If everything fails, then most clients will return failure for
the request. TAO clients will attempt to contact other
Implementation Repositories that are specified on the
command-line, in environment variables, or found through
multicast. </p>

<ul>
    <li>If all of the profiles fail, then contact the other
        Implementation Repositories. First get those specified on
        the command line or in environment variables.</li>
    <li>Then, if multicast is available: <ul>
            <li>Multicast the Object Reference to a group of
                Implementation Repositories </li>
            <li>Wait until response or a timeout. The response
                will contain the Object Reference of a
                Implementation Repository that knows about the
                Object Reference </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Connect to the Implementation Repository that responds
        first.</li>
    <li>Call <i>activate</i> passing the Persistent Object
        Reference.</li>
    <li>If a new Object Reference was sent back then retry the
        request using the it. If this request fails, then fail
        (no more retries).</li>
    <li>If a null reference was sent back, then fail.</li>
</ul>

<p>TAO clients will have an optimization where if there are
several IORs that have the same server name, and one of them gets
forwarded, then the client will be able to change its other IORs
without going through the overhead of contacting Implementation
Repository.</p>
