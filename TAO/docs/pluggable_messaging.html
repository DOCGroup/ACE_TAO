            <h1>Pluggable Messaging Framework</h1>
  <HR>
    <h2>Context</h2>
          TAO uses GIOP message formats to exchange messages between
          inter-operating ORBs. GIOP, essentially specifies formats of
          messages exchanged between ORBs. It has only a few message
          types but still provides full CORBA support. But, there has
          been a trend to try out different message formats like <a
          HREF= "http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-HTTP-NG-architecture/">
          HTTP-NG </a> for inter-ORB communication. This framework
          tends to take a first step in the direction to support
          different protocols. The framework,though not complete in
          itself, has been used for implementing GIOP and
          GIOPlite. The framework would be re-factored and reworked
          depending on the use cases our users come across.

    <h2>Idea</h2>
          We wanted to give a flexibility to the user to load the message
          formatting protocol by selecting a protocol during the
          bootstrapping process. So, we tried to leverage the work
          that has already been done for the <a HREF =
          "pluggable_protocols/index.html"> pluggable_protocols</a>.

          The fundamental idea that we followed was to isolate all of
          the ORB code from the message formatting details. The
          framework is constrained by the type of marshalling
          scheme. The framework now completely relies on CDR
          formatted streams.


          <h2>Implementation of GIOP</h2>

          <P>The common interface that has  been defined is the class
          Pluggable_Messaging_Interface forms the core class for the
          implementation of a concrete messaging protocol. We have
          been able to implement the GIOP & GIOPlite successfully using
          this minimal interface. The different versions of GIOP have
          been managed successfully within this implementation.</P>

          <P>When the user loads protocols like IIOP he/she in turn is
          loading the TCP/IP mapping of GIOP formatted message. The
          same argument can be used for UIOP, SHMIOP too. So, using
          this fundamental understanding, we load the GIOP protocol for
          the user behind the scene. If an user wants to use GIOPlite
          mapped on to TCP/IP he would load IIOP_Lite using the
          svc.conf file. The format is given below </P>

          <P><code>dynamic IIOP_Lite_Factory Service_Object * TAO:_make_TAO_IIOP_Lite_Protocol_Factory() ""</code></P>
          <P><code>static Resource_Factory "-ORBProtocolFactory IIOP_Lite_Factory". </code></P>

          <P>At the moment the TAO Strategies library is used the
          svc.conf file should contain: </P>

          <P><code>dynamic IIOP_Lite_Factory Service_Object * TAO:_make_TAO_IIOP_Lite_Protocol_Factory() ""</code></P>
          <P><code>static Advanced_Resource_Factory "-ORBProtocolFactory IIOP_Lite_Factory". </code></P>

          <P>Please see the documentation of the pluggable protocol
          framework for exact meaning of the above syntax. The same
          applies to GIOPlite mapping on UIOP too.</P>

          <P>The class GIOP_Message_Base derives from the
          Pluggable_Messaging_Interface. This class holds most of the
          common code needed for the GIOP classes. GIOP places a
          restriction on the client and server roles, in terms of
          initiating and receiving messages. This concept has been
          mapped on to the framework by two sets implementation
          classes, namely GIOP_Message_Connectors and
          GIOP_Message_Acceptors. </P>

          <P>The GIOP_Message_Connector and the derived classes
          implements the different types of messages that can
          originate from the client. In GIOP 1.2, with the
          specification of Bi-Directional GIOP, this disticntion
          between the client and server would decrease. But, this
          would be applicable only for GIOP 1.2. The present
          inheritance model, allows us to implement some of the roles
          defined for the server in the 1.0 and 1.1 versions of GIOP, on
          the client side. This needs to be done only for 1.2.</P>

          <P>The GIOP_Message_Acceptor class is a Context, which maintains
          a reference to a strategy based on the incoming request.</P>

          <P>The GIOP specification specifies that if a server supports
          GIOP-1.2, it should also offer support for GIOP-1.1 and
          GIOP-1.0. This would mean that clients that can communicate
          in any of the three protocols can connect to a server that
          supports 1.2. The server should also reply based on the same
          revision.</P>

          <P> The strategisation on the server side is based on the
          different version numbers of GIOP. The reference that would
          be maintained by the context, GIOP_Message_Acceptor, would
          be based on the version number of the incoming request. The
          reply is also sent using the same reference. This makes it
          possible to send compatible replies to the client. </P>

          <h2>Limitations</h2>
          <P> Uses only CDR formats. </P>
          <P> Need more ise cases to make the interface more flexible
          and better. </P>
