<h3>
TAO IDL Compiler User's Guide</h3>

<h3> Scope</h3> This document describes the options and features of
TAO IDL compiler.  It is not a reference manual or tutorial on OMG
IDL.  For more information on OMG IDL see the <A
HREF="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/corba_spec_catalog.htm">
online CORBA specification</A> and the <A
HREF="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi-henning.html">Advanced CORBA
Programming with C++</A> book.  More information on the design of
TAO's IDL compiler is also available <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/ami1.pdf">online</A>.
Finally, comprehensive documentation on TAO's IDL compiler is
available in the OCI <A HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com/product/index.html">TAO
Developer's Guide</A>.<P>

<h3>Optional CIAO Functionality</h3>

For users of the <b>Component Integrated ACE ORB</b>
(<a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/CIAO.html"> CIAO</a>), it is
important to note that, in keeping with recent developments in
the OMG's Lightweight CORBA Component Model
(<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/components.htm"> LwCCM</a>) specification,
CIAO's <i>Component Implementation Definition Language</i> (CIDL) compiler,
along with the .cidl files it processed, have been eliminated, and replaced
by additional functionality in the TAO IDL compiler. All the additional files
generated and command line options used are described below.

<HR><P>
<h3>Generated Files</h3>

The IDL compiler generates up to 16 files from each <tt>.idl</tt> file.  The
file names are obtained by taking the IDL <EM>basename</EM> and
appending the following suffixes (see the list of TAO's IDL compiler
<A HREF="#options">options</A> on how to get different suffixes for
these files:) <P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B><EM>Client stubs</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*C.h</tt>,
      <tt>*C.inl</tt>, and <tt>*C.cpp</tt>.  Pure client applications
      only need to <code>#include</code> and link with these files.
  <LI> <B><EM>Server skeletons</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>,  <tt>*S.h</tt>, and
      <tt>*S.cpp</tt>.  Servers need to <code>#include</code> and link
      with these files. Generation of these files may be suppressed with the <tt>-SS</tt> option.
  <LI> <B><EM>Server skeleton templates</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*S_T.h</tt>, <tt>S_T.inl</tt>,
      and <tt>*S_T.cpp</tt>.  Some C++ compilers do not like template
      and non-template code in the same files, so TAO's IDL compiler
      generates these files separately. These files define tie classes,
      used to enable servant inheritance trees, and are not generated by
      default.
  <LI> <B><EM>Anyop files</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*A.h</tt>,
       and <tt>*A.cpp</tt>. Optionally generated files containing
       typecode and Any insertion/extraction operator definitions.
       This option enables the contents of these files to remain
       unlinked if not used.
  <LI> <B><EM>CIAO servant files</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*_svnt.h</tt>,
      and <tt>*_svnt.cpp</tt>. Optionally generated files, containing component
      and home servant implementations, as well as factory fuctions to create
      components and homes.
  <LI> <B><EM>Executor IDL file</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*E.idl</tt>.
      IDL file containing local interfaces used for component and home
      executors, optionally generated.
  <LI> <B><EM>Executor implementation files</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*_exec.h</tt>,
      and <tt>*_exec.cpp</tt>. Optionally generated files containing executor implementation classes
      with empty function bodies for facet, supported and inherited operations,
      as well as factory functions to create component and home executors.
  <LI> <B><EM>Connector implementation files</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*_conn.h</tt>,
      and <tt>*_conn.cpp</tt>. Optionally generated files containing connector implementation classes
      with complete function bodies. The function implementations are specialized
      for DDS at present, but will be configurable to other connection mechanisms
      in the future.
  <LI> <B><EM>Export header files</EM></B>, <EM>i.e.</EM>, <tt>*_export.h</tt>.
      Optionally generated files defining export/import macros as well as
      corresponding macros related to singletons and tracing, all in terms of
      existing ACE macros. Note that, while these files must have the
      "_export.h" suffix, the base name of the file is usually not derived
      from the IDL filename, as is the stem of the other file groups above.
      There can be as many as 4 of these files per build, for stub, skeleton,
      servant, and executor export macros, and they may also be generated by
      the Perl script <tt>generate_export_file.pl</tt>, located in
      <tt>$ACE_ROOT/bin</tt>.
</UL>

TAO's IDL compiler creates separate <TT>*.inl</TT> and <TT>*S_T.*</TT>
files to improve the performance of the generated code.  For example,
the <TT>*.inl</TT> files enable you to compile with inlining enabled or
not, which is useful for trading-off compile-time and run-time
performance.  Fortunately, you need to <CODE>#include</CODE> only the
client stubs declared in the <tt>*C.h</tt> file and the skeletons in
the <tt>*S.h</tt> file in your code. Inline files are not generated
for CIAO servant or executor implementation code.<P>

<a name="idl_env"><h3>Environment Variables</h3></a>

<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=0>
  <TH>Variable
  <TH>Usage
  <TR>
    <TD>TAO_IDL_PREPROCESSOR
    <TD>Used to override the program name of the preprocessor that TAO_IDL
            uses.
  <TR>
    <TD>TAO_IDL_PREPROCESSOR_ARGS
    <TD>Used to override the flags passed to the preprocessor that TAO_IDL
        uses.  This can be used to alter the default options for the
        preprocessor and specify things like include directories and how
        the preprocessor is invoked.  Two flags that will always be passed to
        the preprocessor are <CODE>-DIDL</CODE> and <CODE>-I.</CODE>.
  <TR>
    <TD>TAO_ROOT
        <TD>Used to determine where <CODE>orb.idl</CODE> is located.
  <TR>
    <TD>ACE_ROOT
        <TD>Used to determine where <CODE>orb.idl</CODE> is located.
  <TR>
    <td>CIAO_ROOT
        <TD>Used to determine where <code>Components.idl</code> is located.</TD>
    </td>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Because TAO_IDL doesn't have any code to implement a preprocessor, it has
to use an external one.  For convenience, it uses a built-in name for an external
preprocessor to call.  During compilation, this is how that default is set:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>If the macro TAO_IDL_PREPROCESSOR is defined, then it will use that.
  <LI>Else if the macro ACE_CC_PREPROCESSOR is defined, then it will use that.
  <LI>Otherwise, it will use "cc"
</OL>

<P>And the same behavior occurs for the TAO_IDL_PREPROCESSOR_ARGS and
ACE_CC_PREPROCESSOR_ARGS macros.</P>

<P>Case 1 is used by the Makefile on most machines to specify the preprocessor.
Case 2 is used on Windows and platforms that need special arguments passed
to the preprocessor (MVS, HPUX, etc.).  And case 3 isn't used at all,
but is included as a default case.</P>

<P>Since the default preprocessor may not always work when TAO_IDL is moved to
another machine or used in cross-compilation, it can be overriden at runtime
by setting the environment variables TAO_IDL_PREPROCESSOR and
TAO_IDL_PREPROCESSOR_ARGS.</P>

<P>In previous versions, the environment variables CPP_LOCATION and
TAO_IDL_DEFAULT_CPP_FLAGS were used for this purpose.  Both will still work,
but TAO_IDL will display a deprecation warning if it detects one of these.
It is possible that support for these old variables will be removed in a
future version of TAO.</P>

<P>If ACE_ROOT or TAO_ROOT are defined, then TAO_IDL
will use them to include the $(ACE_ROOT)/TAO/tao or $(TAO_ROOT)/tao
directories. This is to allow TAO_IDL to automatically find
&lt;orb.idl&gt; when it is included in an IDL file.  TAO_IDL will
display a warning message when neither is defined.</P>

<h3>Operation Demuxing Strategies</h3>

The server skeleton can use different demuxing strategies to match the
incoming operation with the correct operation at the servant.  TAO's
IDL compiler supports perfect hashing, binary search, and dynamic
hashing demuxing strategies.  By default, TAO's IDL compiler tries to
generate perfect hash functions, which is generally the most <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/COOTS-99.pdf">efficient and
predictable operation demuxing technique</A>.  To generate perfect
hash functions, TAO's IDL compiler uses <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/gperf.pdf">gperf </a>, which
is a general-purpose perfect hash function generator. <P>

To configure TAO's IDL compiler to support perfect hashing please do
the following:

<ul>
  <LI>Enable <CODE>ACE_HAS_GPERF</CODE> when building ACE and TAO.
      This macro has been defined for the platforms where <CODE>gperf</CODE>
      has been tested, which includes most <A
      HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-versions-i.html">platforms</A>
      that ACE runs on. <P>

  <li>Build the <CODE>gperf</CODE> in $ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf.  This build
      also leaves a copy/link of the ace_gperf program at the $ACE_ROOT/bin
      directory.<P>

  <li>Set the environment variable $ACE_ROOT appropriately or add
      $ACE_ROOT/bin to your search path. <P>

  <li>Use the <CODE>-g</CODE> option for the TAO IDL compiler or set
      your search path accordingly to install <CODE>ace_gperf</CODE> in a
      directory other than $ACE_ROOT/bin.
</ul>

Note that if you can't use perfect hashing for some reason the next
best operation demuxing strategy is binary search, which can be
configured using TAO's IDL compiler <A HREF="#options">options</A>.<P>

<h3>AMI support</h3>

The TAO_IDL compiler generates AMI stubs and skeletons as
described in the CORBA 3.0.3 specification.

<hr><p>
<h3><a name="collocation-stubs">Collocation Strategies</a></h3>

TAO_IDL can generate collocated stubs using two different collocation
strategies.  It also allows you to supress/enable the generation of
the stubs of a particular strategy.  To gain great flexibility at
run-time, you can generate stubs for both collocation strategies
(using both '<a href="#Gp"><code>-Gp</code></a>' and '<a
href="#Gd"><code>-Gd</code></a>' flags at the same time) and defer the
determination of collocation strategy until run-time.  On the other
hand, if you want to minimize the footprint of your program, you might
want to pre-determine the collocation strategy you want and only
generate the right collocated stubs (or not generating any at all using
both  '<a href="#Sp"><code>-Sp</code></a>' and '<a
href="#Sd"><code>-Sd</code></a>' flags at the same time if
it's a pure client.)  See our <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/C++-report-col18.pdf">collocation
paper</a> for a detail discussion on the collocation support in
TAO.<p>

<h3><A NAME="options">TAO's IDL Compiler Options</A></h3>

TAO's IDL compiler invokes your <tt>C</tt> (or <tt>C++</tt>)
preprocessor to resolve included IDL files.  It receives the common
options for preprocessors (such as <tt>-D</tt> or <tt>-I</tt>).  It
also receives other options that are specific to it.<p>
