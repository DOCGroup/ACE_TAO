      <p>Persistent State Service (PSS) describes a way of making a
	service persistent. The fact that PSS is being used by a
	service is known only to the service (server) and not to the
	client which makes use of the service. PSS presents persistent
	information as storage objects stored in storage homes, to
	quote the specification. The storage homes are the datastores
	where the persistent data is saved. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The specification introduced Persistent State Definition
	Language (PSDL), a superset of IDL with five new
	constructs. PSDL is used to specify the interface to the
	datastore. The PSDL file used in the application will define
	the types that might be saved in the datastore. </p>
      <br>
      <p>We have a compiler, psdl_tao, which is similar to the tao_idl
	compiler, which will process the psdl file and generate stubs
	that are used mainly for the insertion and extraction
	operations.
      </p>

      <a name="current"><h3>Current status:</h3></a>

      <ul>
        <li><p>The PSDL compiler understands and supports the simple
	    types like <br><CODE>
	      typdef, module, structures, interfaces.</CODE>
	  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> The datastore for now is a regular file. The
	    <CODE>libTAO_PSDL_Datastore</CODE> interfaces the
	    datastore and helps write and read from the datastore.
	    The data that is saved persistently is a hash map whose
	    external id is TAO_PSDL_String, a wrapper around
	    ACE_CString and the internal id is TAO_PSDL_OctetSeq, a
	    wrapper around for CORBA::OctetSeq. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
	  <p> There is an example in
	    $ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs/examples/PSS which shows how the PSS
	    can be used to make a simplified naming service persistent.
	  </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a name="future"><h3>Future work:</h3></a>

      <ul>
        <li>
	  <p>Add support to the remaining types defined in PSDL.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
	  <p>Use RMCast to have another form of persistency via data
	    replication.
          </p>
        </li>

      </ul>
