The IDL_Cubit test for Hardpack ORB
------------------------------------

Compiling
---------

setup the HARDPACK_ROOT environment variables before compiling.

The following is an  example configuration for SunOS_5.5.1:

setenv HARDPACK_ROOT /project/doc/pkg/Hardpack/dsi_5.1
setenv PATH ${HARDPACK_ROOT}/bin:${HARDPACK_ROOT}/SunOS_5.5.1/bin:${PATH}        
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${HARDPACK_ROOT}/SunOS_5.5.1/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

1. Hardpack provides a build tool to build the Makefile from the Imakefile. 
You should set the BUILD variable in the Imakefile to the directory of
your Hardpack for your platform.

2.To build and compile 

 $build SUN

 $build clean 
        will clean the object files and executables and also the Makefile.

To Run:
------

1. Edit the initref.cfg file in this directory by putting the hostname
on which  you want the name  server to run.

2. Run the Hardpack nameserver

   $nameserver

3. Run the server
        
   $server

4. Run the client
        
   $client
