Changelog for chapter 3 example in "Advanced CORBA Programming
with C++" by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski, Copyright 1999,
Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA.  The following changes have been made
to the book's source code to make the example work with TAO and
with various platforms and compilers.

______________________________________________________________________________
ESSENTIAL CHANGES:
  1. changed filenames .cc to .cpp and .hh h, and modified #includes in
     client.cpp server.cpp and server.h appropriately.

  2. a) changed #include "time.h"  to  #include "timeC.h" in client.cpp

     b) Moved standard #includes below local #includes, and commented-out
        unnecessary #includes to avoid warnings and errors (g++)
          -client.cpp now reads:
              #include "timeC.h"
              #include <iomanip.h>
              // #include <iostream.h>
          -server.cpp now reads:
              #include "server.h"
              // #include <time.h>
              // #include <iostream.h>

ADDITIONAL CHANGES:
  3. added .in() to _var type parameters
       -3 times in client.cpp for calls to is_nil() and _narrow()
       -3 times in main() in server.cpp for calls to _narrow(),
        object_to_string, and <<
