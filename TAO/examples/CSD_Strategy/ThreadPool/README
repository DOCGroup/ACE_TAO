Description:

This is the simplest example shows the use of a Custom Servant Dispatching (CSD)
Strategy.  This test uses the reference implementation, known as the Thread Pool
CSD Strategy.  This tests some simple remote two-way CORBA requests and a simple
remote one-way request.

The server application creates one servant object, runs the ORB event
loop using the main thread, and uses one worker thread for the
Thread Pool CSD Strategy.

The client application invokes simple two-way calls on the object
reference.  There is also a simple one-way call that is also made on
the object reference.

The run_test.pl script will launch 1 sever process, and 40 client processes.
Each client process will make invocations on the single object reference
provided by the (single) server process.

Executables:

  * client_main

      This is the client test executable.

      Command-line arguments:

        -? : Prints the executable's available command-line options, and
             then exits.

        -i <ior string> : Provide the IOR to the client (ie, file://some.ior).

  * server_main

      This is the server test executable.

      Command-line arguments:

        -? : Prints the executable's available command-line options, and
             then exits.

        -o <ior filename> : Name of file to which the IOR will be written.

        -n <num_clients> : The number of clients that will use the server.

  * run_test.pl

      This perl script will run an automated test using 40 client processes
      and 1 server process.  The script returns 0 if the test was successful.

      No command-line options are supported.  Simply execute the perl script
      as follows:

          $ ./run_test.pl
