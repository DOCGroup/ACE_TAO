Description:

This is another test showing the use of a Custom Servant Dispatching
(CSD) Strategy.  This test uses the reference implementation, known as the
Thread Pool CSD Strategy.  This tests some simple remote two-way CORBA
requests and a simple remote one-way request.

The server application creates 1 servant object, runs the ORB event
loop using 4 threads (one being the main thread), and uses 10 worker
threads for the Thread Pool CSD Strategy.

The client application invokes simple two-way calls on the object
reference.  There is also a simple one-way call that is also made on
the object reference.

The run_test.pl script will launch 1 sever process, and 40 client processes.


Executables:

  * client_main

      This is the client test executable.

      Command-line arguments:

        -? : Prints the executable's available command-line options, and
             then exits.

        -i <ior string> : Provide the IOR to the client (ie, file://some.ior).

  * server_main

      This is the server test executable.

      Command-line arguments:

        -? : Prints the executable's available command-line options, and
             then exits.

        -o <ior filename> : Name of file to which IOR will be written.

        -n <num clients> : The number of clients that will use the server.

        -t <num ORB threads> : Number of threads running the ORB event loop.

  * run_test.pl

      This perl script will run an automated test using 40 client processes
      and 1 server process.  The script returns 0 if the test was successful.

      No command-line options are supported.  Simply execute the perl script
      as follows:

          $ ./run_test.pl
