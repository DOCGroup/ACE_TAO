This program illustrates how to implement a simple client and server
using CORBA, IIOP, and asynchronous method invocations (AMI).  Client
applications can use this service to download and display files from a
CORBA server on the network.  The core functionality of this program
is as follows:

        * Client applications register callbacks with servers using
           the Observer pattern.  The server will ``push'' chunks of
           data to the client.  Thus, the client will play the role of
           a ``server,'' as well.

        * Operations in the IDL interface will use exceptions to propagate
          problems back to clients.

        * The CORBA Naming Service is used to bind and resolve object
          references, rather than using a file.


Basic design of the programs:

The basic idea used in both the client and and the server is to use
AMI when performing all requests.  This allows both the client and the
server to perform other tasks without having to wait for a given task
to complete.

The client first activates its Callback object, and then
asynchronously registers a reference to its Callback object with the
server's Push_Iterator_Factory.  The Push_Iterator_Factory then
creates an AMI reply handler "Callback_Handler" for the requested file
that asynchronously sends chunks of data to the client's Callback
object.  After creating and running the Callback_Handler, the
Push_Iterator_Factory returns the Metadata containing the content type
and modification date of the file to client.  Since the Callback was
registered using the Push_Iterator_Factory using AMI, an AMI reply
handler called "Push_Iterator_Handler" on the client side will receive
and handle the Metadata returned from the Push_Iterator_Factory.  The
Push_Iterator_Handler then passes the received Metadata to the
Callback object.  The Callback will spawn an external viewer once both
the Metadata and the entire file content have been received.  The
Callback object is designed to correctly handle the case where the
content is received before the Metadata, and vice versa.  This
operation is thread-safe.  Note that no threads are created at the
application level in neither the client nor the server, yet
concurrency is still achieved due to the fact that AMI is used on both
sides.

A schematic of the operations involved follows:

  CLIENT				SERVER
  ------				------
  Push_Iterator_Handler - activate
  Callback - activate			Push_Iterator_Factory - activate

  sendc_register_callback()	--->	register_callback()
					Callback_Handler - activate

  next_chunk()			<---	sendc_next_chunk()
  .					.
  .					.
  .					.
  next_chunk()			<---	sendc_next_chunk()

  register_callback()		<---	Metadata - returned
  Metadata passed to Callback

  next_chunk()			<---	sendc_next_chunk()
  .					.
  .					.
  .					.
  next_chunk()			<---	sendc_next_chunk()

Note that the Callback_Handler will not send the next chunk until it
receives a reply from the client's Callback object.  This ensures that
the client receives all chunks of data in the proper order.


The client program performs the following activities:

        1. From the command-line, it reads the name of the pathname
           you want to download.  It then initializes the client-side
           ORB and uses resolve_initial_references() to obtain a
           reference to a Naming Service (which must be running). This
           object reference is then downcast via _narrow() to an
           object reference for a CosNaming::NamingContext interface,
           which is then used to resolve the object reference that the
           server bound earlier.  After narrowing this to the Server
           interface, the sendc_register_callback() operation is
           called via the object reference to pass asynchronously pass
           the Callback interface from the client to the server, which
           then uses AMI to push chunks of the file to the client.

        2. The server calls the sendc_next_chunk() method on the
           callback, passing in the offset and the next chunk.

        3. When the client receives the next_chunk() callback that
           contains a chunk of the file, the contents are written into
           a temporary file created in your a cache (e.g.,
           /tmp/yourloginname) on the local host.  Then, an external
           viewer is spawned to display the file.  The type of viewer
           to spawn is determined by examining the the content_type_
           metadata returned by the server.


The example can be run as follows:

	1. Start the Name Service:

		$ NameService -o /tmp/ns.ior

	2. Start the SMI Content Server:

		$ server -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior

	3. Request a file using the client:

		$ client -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior \
		~/foo.jpg ~/bar.pdf ~/baz.jpg

This example can service multiple file requests.


Server output should look like the following:

$ ./server -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior
Bound <Push_Iterator_Factory> to <IOR:010000002300000039434c3a5765625f5365727665722f4974657261746f725f466163746f72793a312e300001000000000000007c000000010102001400000076616c696e6f722e6563652e7563692e65647500489700001b00000014010f00525354a6ae4e392ad209000000000001000000010000000003000000000000000800000001000000004f4154010000001400000001ac854001000100000000000901010000000000004f41540400000001ac0000> in Name Service.

Notice that requests for chunks of data from three separate files occur
in the above run.


Client output should look similar to:

$ ./client -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior ~/foo.jpg ~/bar.pdf \
~/baz.jpg
