Mon Mar 15 02:27:05 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/POA.{h,cpp}: Applied "some" ACE try macros into POA.
	  (etherealize_servants): Moved the function out of destroy
	  method.

	* tao/POAManager.{h,i,cpp} (remove_poa): Removed the POAManager if
	  there is no more POA under this POAManager's control.  The
	  current implementation may cause potential race condition when
	  one thread hold the lock to remove the last POA and another
	  thread is blocked the POAManager's lock and is trying to add
	  another POA into this POAManager.  This should be solved by
	  refcounting the POAMnanger's usage but currently, POA uses
	  TAO_POA_Manager directly...
	  (deactivate_i): According to the spec., this function should
	  etherealize servants in the managing POAs and wait for request
	  completion instead of destroying the POAs.
	  (activate_i,hold_requests_i,discard_requests_i,deactivate_i):
	  Added these no-lock functions.

Sun Mar 14 18:05:51 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Param_Test/*.h
	* tests/Param_Test/*.cpp: Made the changes that are necessary
	  because of the previous changes to the tao/Request.*

Sun Mar 14 14:58:51 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Request.i:
	* tao/Request.cpp:
	* tao/Request.h: Changed the arguments of two method call in the
	  Request class. They are send_oneway () and invoke (). They now
	  take in the environment variable ACE_TRY_ENV that should be
	  passed in from the application. These methods were using a
	  variable env_ stored in the class itself. The variable env_ has
	  also been removed thus necesitating the users of the API to send
	  their own environment variables that should be theoretically in
	  a TRY block.

	* performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
	  Made the changes that is a fallout of the above changes..

Sun Mar 14 14:13:22 19	99  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout): Fixed
	  warnings reported by David and Carlos for g++/egcs.  Replaced
	  the constant 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF with 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFull and
	  for platforms lacking Ulonglong, called the constructor of
	  ACE_U_LongLong.

	  (handle_timeout): Added the ACE_UINT64_LITERAL () to fix an NT
	  warning.

Sat Mar 13 23:35:01 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosEC_Multiple.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECConsumer.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
	  fixed minor compile warnings regarding "statements not reached",
	  "unused parameters", and using .in ().

Sat Mar 13 23:33:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp: removed trailing semicolons from instantiation
          pragmas.

Sat Mar 13 21:53:57 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the Inaccuracy measure to the time returned by a
        Universal Time Object (UTO). The inaccuracy is a 64 bit number
        broken into inacchi and inacclo as :

                Inaccuracy 64-bits
        |------------------------------------|
        |         | inacchi |   inacclo      |
        |------------------------------------|
          16-bits   16-bits     32-bits

        The current measure of inaccuracy is the skew in synchronization of
        the clerk's time. It is the difference in the largest and smallest
        times from servers that the clerk syncs its time with. The inaccuracy
        is dynamically updated with every time synchronization cycle.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout): Added the
        logic to calculate the inaccuracy from the times returned by servers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp :
        Constructed the Inaccuracy within UTO from the hi,lo values in UTC
        struct in uto_from_utc(). Filled the UTO with the current inaccuracy
        estimate in universal_time (). Added the GET/SET methods for the
        inaccuracy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h :
        Added a class variable for inaccuracy estimate and the declarations
        for the GET/SET methods. These are used by the Timer_Helper class to
        set the inaccuracy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp :
        Changed the constructor to initialise the UTO inacchi and inacclo
        with properly extracted bits from the given inaccuracy. Rewrote the
        GET method for inaccuracy to construct the inaccuracy from the UTC
        struct hi,lo values. This was previously being returned as just the
        addition of hi and lo values.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Client_i.cpp : Changed the test to test for the
        newly added inaccuracy and timezone information in the UTO time.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/README : Updated to include this addition in
        the Time Service.

        Thanks to Brian Dance <Brian_Dance@UECCS.co.uk> for reporting this.

Sat Mar 13 11:58:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp:
          Removed unused variable, thanks to David Levine for reporting
          this.

        * TAO-INSTALL.html:
          Updated the notes on how to compile TAO.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs_static.dsp:
          Added the new event channel files to the static library.
          Also removed some old files that are no longer used
          (Event/Task_Manager.cpp) thanks to Francois Bernier
          <fbernier@gel.ulaval.ca> for reporting this problem.

Sat Mar 13 11:57:27 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init): Revised the multicast_query() stuff just
          a bit to make it easier to maintain.

Sat Mar 13 00:44:51 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.11 released.

Fri Mar 12 20:48:00 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/IR_Helper.cpp: Fixed improper use of
          TAO_RETHROW macros.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Fixed problem in location forwarding, the
          test for errors while demarshaling the new object reference was
          inverted.

Fri Mar 12 19:51:36 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: Fixed some
          bugs with forwarding support in void functions without output
          arguments.

        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Fixed warning about unused variable.

          in generated code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
          Cosmetic changes.

          Added the new Nestea Bookshelf test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/README:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/run_test.pl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/ImplRepo.dsw:

          Changed because of the new test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/IR_Helper.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.h:

          Now uses ACE exception handling macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_client_i.cpp:

          Added the -k option for IOR input.

Fri Mar 12 14:11:28 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ORB.h, ORB.cpp and orbconf.h: Fixed multicast problem.  Removed
          dynamic memory allocation in multicast_query () and now pass a
          pointer to a buffer allocated on the stack in
          multicast_to_service ().  Also added a macro
          TAO_DEFAULT_MULTICAST_SEND_ATTEMPTS = 2.  This control the
          number of attempts multicast)query () will make to get a
          response.

          Also moved a call to multicast.close () to after to attempt
          loop.  It seems when multicast.close () is called the reply
          packet from the server is lost on solaris hosts.  By moving this
          to after the recv the packets are now read on the first recv.

Fri Mar 12 12:23:07 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout):
          Retrieved the timezone information and set the time displacement
          factor for the clerk's time.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h : Added the
           GET/SET methods for the time displacement factor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp : Added
          implementation for the above methods. Passed the time zone
          information to the UTO created in universal_time ().

          The timer_helper uses the newly added timezone wrappers of
          OS.h. These wrappers are yet to be tested on NT. Thanks to Brian
          Dance <Brian_Dance@UECCS.co.uk> for reporting this.

Fri Mar 12 10:38:18 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * tao/CDR_Interpreter.cpp:

          setup_entry for objrect references required
          TAO_Object_Field_T<CORBA_Object> as the first parameter instead
          of CORBA_OBject_ptr for the accurate size computation. Thanks to
          Alexey Gadzhiev <alg@null.ru> for reporting the bug and
          supplying us with a test program and other information to help
          us fix the bug.

        * tao/{encode, decode, deep_free}.cpp:

          In encode/decode/deep_free for structures, for the case where we
          are dealing with fields that are object references, we cast the
          data to TAO_Object_Field_T<CORBA_Object>* instead of simply
          TAO_Object_Field*. These changes were made during the bug fix
          described aove. These fixes also removed the Array Bounds Read
          (ABR) error message produced by Purify.

Fri Mar 12 00:35:47 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp Fixed the problem of client
          not being able to resolve Naming Service ior through multicast
          when client and server are run on different hosts.  Thanks to
          Steve Totten for tracking down since when this was broken, and
          to Carlos O'Ryan for providing hypotheses as to why.

          Made the server wait a little bit before sending a reply to the
          multicast as well as send a reply several times.  This 1) gives
          client a chance to start listening for a reply, 2) provides a
          better protection against packet loss.  (The problem was
          occuring because the server sent a reply before the client had a
          chance to start receiving.  This was happening due to the added
          dynamic memory allocation in the client code in the interval
          between multicast_send and reply_receive).

          A more flexible policy-based solution should be added (as
          opposed to hardcoding intervals and retries).  This will
          probably be a part of Vishal's upcoming Interoperable Naming
          Service changes.

          Values encoded in the code now should work for most
          platforms/networks.  However, they are not guaranteed to work
          for all!  Part of the problem is that UDP is unreliable, so in
          theory can be retransmitted 100 times and still not work.  Also,
          specific network configurations (busy network, busy hosts, old
          routers, etc.) may have special needs.  Again, this should be
          better addressed once hardcoded values are replaced by flexible
          policies.

Thu Mar 11 22:49:35 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): INET_Addr::get_port_number ()
          returns a port number converted to host byte order.  Made
          changes to account for that.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp: Made sure that upon the
          receipt of the multicast packet, the reply was sent to the port
          indicated in the array contained in the packet as opposed to the
          port from which the packet came from.

Thu Mar 11 20:41:39 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp: There were some major
          inconsistencies with byte order conversions.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): Fixed some subtle bugs with
          multicast.  First, we were sending a struct when we should have
          been sending an array (due to portability issues with struct
          padding).  Second, we weren't being consistent with ACE macros.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): There was a read of BUFSIZ where
          there should have been a read of ACE_MAX_DGRAM_SIZE.  Thanks to
          Marina for noticing this.

Thu Mar 11 20:46:04 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp
          In the CosNaming_Client::init () changed
              // Initialize ORB.
                is->orbmgr_.init (argc,
                                  argv,
                                  TAO_TRY_ENV);
          to
              // Initialize ORB.
              this->orbmgr_.init (this->argc_,
                                  this->argv_,
                                  TAO_TRY_ENV);

          to facilitate proper processing of the arguments.

Thu Mar 11 19:55:18 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp: Fixed template instantiations and some warnings.

        * tao/encode.cpp: Removed unused variable.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl: Use IOR object references, they
          are actually easier than URL-style.

        * tao/Stub.i:
        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Implemented compiled marshaling and demarshaling of object
          references.
          Removed uses of do_static_call() from the
          CORBA::Object class in favor of compiled marshaling.
          Removed several uses of interpretive marshaling, we can use
          compiled marshaling now.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl:
          The client cleanly shutdowns the server now.

Thu Mar 11 16:36:34 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp:
          Fixed code generation of _ptr_type and _var_type
          typedefs to include a guard against certain versions
          of g++.

Thu Mar 11 14:30:05 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
          Check for error in call to Repository::get_hostport

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
          Enabled test for unions and the RTI data structure.

Thu Mar 11 13:59:05 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{i,cpp} (operator<<=): un-inlined, to avoid use of
          inline CORBA::string_dup () before definition.

Thu Mar 11 13:43:12 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          Enabled compiled marshaling by default (again).

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:
          Fixed generated code to handle location forwarding.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_client_i.cpp:
          We don't abort on the first exception, instead we keep
          trying. We also clear the environment before making a
          request.

Wed Mar 10 16:43:55 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Generator.cpp:
          The type of event generated by the filter is can be passed in
          the Filter constructor.
          This is also used to control if the event is a one shot timeout
          or an interval timeout.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp:
          We must create a Timeout_Filter for events of type
          ACE_ES_TIMEOUT_EVENT too.
          The type of event is passed to the Timeout_Filter.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Only push events if the consumer is not disconnected.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          The UDP gateway does not require an scheduler, it can be argued
          that it cannot use an scheduler because UDP is not suitable for
          hard real-time systems.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp:
          Removed scheduler and some includes related to the old EC.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set.h:
          Work around horrible g++ 2.7.2 bug with forward declaration of
          templates.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h:
          Also fixed a couple of g++ 2.7.2 warnings, that look like
          compiler bugs to me.

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Updated some comments in the object reference decoder.

        * tests/CDR/allocator.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

Wed Mar 10 10:43:08 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
          The front-end was incorrectly handling "const" definitions of

          reporting the problem.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/{y.tab.cpp, y.tab.h, lex.yy.cpp}: Regenerated since
          idl.yy was modified.

        and files.

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.h

        Renamed these files to:

        * tao/CDR_Interpreter.h
        * tao/CDR_Interpreter.cpp

        All references to IIOP_Interpreter have been changed to
        CDR_Interpreter since "IIOP_Interpreter" is no longer an accurate
        name for the classes and files in question.

Tue Mar  9 15:40:06 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/big_union.cpp:
          Fixed a MSVC++ double-to-float warning.

        * examples/Quoter/Factory_Finder.cpp:
        * examples/Quoter/Generic_Factory.cpp:
        * examples/Quoter/server.cpp:
          Fixed null-pointer usage in the server destructors when the
          naming service wasn't resolved.

        * examples/Quoter/server.cpp:
          Also fixed some memory leaks.

Tue Mar  9 13:42:49 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe: Regenerated the y.tab.cpp file using Berkeley
          yacc rather than yacc so the nifty tracing features
          will be enabled.

Tue Mar  9 13:05:49 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp: Fixed all the
          Sequence_out parameters to get created even though their length
          may be zero. This is according to the CORBA spec.

Tue Mar 09 01:16:41 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.10 released.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Fixed a problem in the Makefile.

Mon Mar 08 22:20:32 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile (TAO_ORBSVCS_SRCS): if the Trader
          is built without the Naming Service in TAO_ORBSVCS, add
          IOR_Multicast because the Trader needs it.  Thanks to
          Seth for reporting this.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.h:
        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:
          Added support for file://-style IORs; we simply use the
          ACE_Read_Buffer class to read the IOR from the file and then
          call string_to_object again.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
          Fixed debug message.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

Mon Mar  8 20:09:07 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Added an entry about the Pluggable test.

Mon Mar  8 19:02:21 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp:
          Added the new typedefs for _ptr_type and _var_type
          (see Advanced CORBA Programming with C++, section 7.6.1).
          I couldn't find anywhere that the IDL compiler
          generates code for template member functions - everything
          like that in orbsvcs seems to be handwritten. If anyone
          sees that I overlooked something. let me know.

Mon Mar  8 16:20:22 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.i: Moved CORBA::string_dup() into the *.i file and made
          it an inline method.  Thanks to Jon Biggar for suggesting this.

Mon Mar  8 16:46:36 1999  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/README:
          Changed description of correct test output to reflect change
          from get_host_by_name () to get_host_by_addr ().

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp:
          Altered the return values in verbosity_conversion to correspond
          to the changed values in ace/Log_Msg.h. Also modified logv to
          use get_host_by_addr () rather than get_host_by_name (). This
          speeds things up somewhat. Thanks to Ulf Jährig for pointing
          this out.

Mon Mar  8 14:27:38 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/skip.cpp:
          The first four files have the new ACE timeprobes for the
          pluggable protocols test. The last has a change in
          TAO_Marshal_Union::skip() from using
          (ACE_Message_Block *) Any::value() to
          Any::_tao_get_cdr ().

Mon Mar  8 13:44:23 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Added a superfast implementation of
          CORBA::string_copy().  Thanks to Terry Rosenbaum
          <Terry.Rosenbaum@Radiology.MSU.edu> for suggesting this and to
          Jon Biggar <jon@biggar.org> for optimizing it still further ;-).

Mon Mar  8 11:08:02 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/include/utl_scope.h:
          TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp:

          Incorporated the right scoping lookup rules based on the latest
          CORBA 2.3 revisions. Thanks to Torsten Kuepper
          <kuepper2@uni-wuppertal.de> for providing the patches.

Sun Mar  7 19:29:06 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

Sun Mar 07 17:39:22 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (send): Remember to reset <iovcnt> after
          we send out a batch of data.

Sun Mar  7 17:27:31 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/client.cpp:
          Removed ACE_OS::thr_exit(). this was borrowed from
          IDL_Cubit/client.cpp. It has been decided that this
          usage is a "Bad Thing"[TM], and that line has been removed
          from the IDL Cubit client as well.

Sun Mar 07 16:39:03 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp (main):
          removed call to ACE_OS::thr_exit ().  It's no longer
          necessary; it's just a relic from a workaround that's
          no longer needed.  Thanks to Jeff for noticing it.

Sun Mar  7 16:03:51 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

          New files implementing tests for pluggable protocols stuff,
          using ACE Timeprobes. Builds and runs fine on NT, builds
          with suncc, but client seg faults on ACE_OS::thr_exit().
          I've emailed the doc group to see if anyone can give me a
          hand with this bug.

Sun Mar  7 10:41:58 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp:
        Fixed the g++ warnings

          In general, redid a lot of exception handling to work better
          with native exceptions.

Fri Mar  5 20:50:23 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile: included the CosEvent_Channel in the list
          of directories to build.

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service{.h, .cpp}:
          replaced the TAO_TRY macros with ACE_ macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/{*.h, *.cpp}:
          replaced the TAO_TRY macros with ACE_ macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer{.h.cpp}:
          added an ORB pointer, which is used to shutdown the ORB
          after a <push> is received by a consumer.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic{.h, .cpp}:
          fixed a bug that caused this test to fail - thanks to
          Jim Crossley <jim@lads.com> for pointing this out.
          The RtEC needs to be constructed with a valid
          TAO_Reactive_Module_Factory. Creating the Rtec on the heap
          with an initialized module factory fixed this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple {*.h, *.cpp}
          replaced the TAO_TRY macros with ACE_ macros.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: updated the CosEC information.

Fri Mar  5 18:11:04 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

          Fixed const correctness problem, Sun/CC didn't even give a
          warning for this one!

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiation.

          Removed redundant cast to ACE_Message_Block* of
          the return value of _tao_get_cdr().

Thu Mar  4 18:40:45 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CurrentC.cpp:
          Changed the code for the >>= operator to get rid of
          another Any::value() inconsistency and to reflect what
          the IDL compiler now generates for these operators.

Thu Mar  4 16:53:28 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp:
          Fixed minor warnings.

Thu Mar  4 12:43:46 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.i:
          Fixed nasty bug, thanks to J. Russell Noseworthy
          <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for catching this one.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Removed a couple of memory leaks, thanks to J. Russell
          Noseworthy <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for catching them up.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          The ACE_EventChannel implementation does not shutdown the ORB
          anymore, instead we use composition in the Event_Service program
          to shutdown the ORB there (where it actually makes sense).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

          Added the TAO_ORBSVCS_Export in many classes.

Thu Mar 04 10:22:55 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.cpp (parse_args):
          when type_count_ <= 0, moved the statement that resets it to 1
          to before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN.  That way, it really will be
          reset to 1 :-)

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp (parse_args):
          when ec_concurrency_hwm_ <= 0, moved the statement that resets
          it to 1 to before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN.

Wed Mar  3 18:28:51 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.cpp:
          Factored out the collection of ProxyPushSuppliers from the
          ConsumerAdmin class: it is used in other places like the
          SupplierFiltering strategies.
          I also added extensive documentation about the several
          variations on this particular strategy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.cpp:
          Added a new SupplierFiltering strategy, simply keep the list of
          consumers for each supplier.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.i:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.cpp:
          Changed the mechanism to match suppliers and consumers: the
          filter objects have a new method that can be used to detect if a
          event is potentially interesting to the consumer.
          The red-black tree is not needed anymore.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp:
          Moved the instantiation of the EventHeader red-black tree to
          this file, because now this is the only place we use it.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.cpp:
          Added new factory methods to create and detroy
          EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set objects.

        * tao/orbconf.h:
          Added description of the TAO_DOTTED_DECIMAL_ADDRESSES macro.

        * tao/MProfile.i:
        * tao/Any.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

Wed Mar  3 18:15:14 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/client.dsp:
        * tests/Param_Test/server.dsp:
          Added big_union.

Wed Mar  3 03:05:06 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/README:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile:
          Removed all the naming service stuff from DII_Cubit_Test.
          Made a note in the README file that the IDL server no
          longer uses it either. Also removed the orbsvcs library
          load from the makefile since we no longer need it. And
          removed client.h from the VC project file and the link to
          orbsvcsd.lib from same.

Tue Mar  2 17:36:29 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEventComm.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEventChannelAdmin.idl:
          added a comment header to describe the idl file contents.

Tue Mar  2 11:41:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DoubleVisComp.java: Added flexible
          monotonic scaling of all DoubleVisComp windows.

Tue Mar  2 02:32:34 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.{h,i,cpp}: Added new file IIOP_Profile.i for
          inline functions.  Moved some accessors from .cpp file to .i
          file.  Added _host_(), _port_(), _object_key_(),
          reset_object_addr() when TAO_USES_FLICK is defined.  Flick needs
          to access the structure directly.

Mon Mar  1 23:37:58 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp:
          Fixed yet another instance of backwards
          any_owns_data behavior, is dsi_marshal(). Will look
          at the rest of Server_Request.cpp later - there
          seems to be questionable stuff in the other methods
          as well.

Mon Mar  1 17:57:18 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/dynany_test/test_dynsequence.cpp:
          Fixed a double-deletion problem with a data string.
          All the dynany test code will need to be looked over
          for memory-handling behavior since the many recent
          changes to the IDL compiler. Thanks to Barry Hoggard
          for reporting this bug.

Mon Mar  1 17:31:57 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/sfp.cpp: Added the flowProtocol:: class
        specifier for frameHeader so that it compiles on win32. Thanks to
        David Hooker <DHooker@uniview.net> for the fix.

Mon Mar 01 17:19:04 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.8 released.

Mon Mar  1 14:43:20 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/compiler.html:
          Fixed minor error in the IDL compiler documentation, thanks to
          Frederic Maria  <fmaria@lucent.com> for pointing this out.

Mon Mar 01 14:20:44 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.7 released.

Mon Mar 01 08:28:26 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: removed ACE_Guard<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX>
          template instantiation, because it collided with
          ACE_Guard<ACE_Thread_Mutex> in ace/Synch.cpp.

Sat Feb 27 20:05:10 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_assign_cs.cpp:
          Removed unused variables.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          The temporary used to read the discriminant must be declared
          using the fully qualified name of the type, because the
          operator>> is in the global scope.

Fri Feb 26 23:41:08 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Oops, unlinking
          of temp file should not be disable on non-Win32 platforms.
          Thanks to David for noticing this.

Fri Feb 26 23:30:12 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: removed the clean target, because it
          deleted tao_idl.  The realclean target does that.  Thanks
          to Tres Seaver <tseaver@palladion.com> for reporting this.

Fri Feb 26 21:03:47 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:
          Added support for forwarding in stubs generated with compiled
          marshaling.
          We use the new ACE_TRY macros to do this.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_label.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_type.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_union_branch.h:
          Fixed code generation for unions whose discriminators are
          enums. It wasn't prefixing the enum label with the scope where
          the enum was generated i.e. for enums defined inside a module
          Foo it was using "value1" instead of "Foo::value1".

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.cpp:
          Fixed Timeprobe use.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/README:
          Added more details, started a section that describes the
          interaction between the components.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp:
          The SupplierFiltering module splits an EventSet into single
          events before passing them to the ProxyPushSuppliers, this is
          needed so that filtering will work correctly.

Fri Feb 26 18:29:04 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/implrepo.conf

          performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf
          performance-tests/Thruput/TAO/svc.conf

          Changed -ORBdemuxstrategy option to
          -ORBsystemidpolicydemuxstrategy


Fri Feb 26 18:00:52 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tao/TAO.dsp:
          Removed file Align.h from the repository, the makefile
          and the project file. All that stuff moved to OS.h
          with the CDR classes.

Fri Feb 26 17:37:04 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added the function next_profile_retry to stub object.

Fri Feb 26 16:46:37 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added some methods to Stub_Object for forwarding.

Fri Feb 26 13:32:35 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/grid/README:
        New file for the benefit of the community. Thanks to Dr.Schmidt
        for reminding me to do this.

Fri Feb 26 12:44:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/big_union.cpp:
          Fixed some warnings for Linux/EGCS.
          check_validity was incomplete.

        * tests/Param_Test/svc.conf:
          Removed obsolete options.

Fri Feb 26 11:35:51 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile:

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.h:
          Implemented compiled marshaling for unions.
          I also had to debug and fix parts of the union implementation
          too.

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile:
        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl:
        * tests/Param_Test/tests.h:

        * tests/Param_Test/big_union.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/big_union.cpp:
          Added a new test for unions, the union contains many basic
          types, sequences, arrays, variable and fixed sized structures,
          object references, sequences, strings, etc.
          I couldn't test unions inside unions because there seems to be a
          bug with union code generator.

Fri Feb 26 10:06:57 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Fixed inline function ordering in Stub.i!

Fri Feb 26 00:43:30 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs: Updated all the ORB services IDL files so that
          they are protected by #ifndef ... #endifs.  Thanks to Lothar
          Werzinger <werzinger.lothar@krones.de> for this suggestion.

Fri Feb 26 00:05:16 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.6 released.

Thu Feb 25 23:38:46 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Fixed another confusion between an Any's value and
          its message block. This one was in TAO_Marshal_Union.
          Maybe unions will work a little better now ;-).

Thu Feb 25 20:19:26 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Cubit_Task.h:

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.h:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp:

        Modified these files so that they will compile if ACE was built
        without thread support by changing ACE_MT_SYNCH macros to
        ACE_SYNCH and by using the ACE_SYNCH_SEMAPHORE macro instead of
        ACE_Thread_Semaphore.  Thanks to Doug for suggesting the ACE_SYNCH
        changes.

        ACE_Condition in Task_Client.h for the unthreaded case will be
        dealt with soon.

Thu Feb 25 18:16:31 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/compiled_marshal_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/compiled_marshal_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/compiled_marshal.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          IDL generated code was passing in the size instead of
          the length for bounded strings. Then CDR would add 1
          to get back the size... Just subtracted 1 in the
          appropriate spots in IDL compiler code. Checked out the
          new version in param_test and all seems to be ok. Thanks to
          Henrik Nordberg <hnordberg@lbl.gov> for reporting this bug.

Thu Feb 25 16:06:49 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: Added make commands to generate dummy *S_T.*
          files when building with Flick.

Thu Feb 25 15:53:13 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be
          TAO_IDL/driver
        Changed the TAO_TRY macros with ACE_TRY macros in the
        IDL generated stubs and skeletons

Thu Feb 25 15:35:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (main): removed
          ACE_OS::thr_exit () call on VxWorks, because it's no longer
          necessary:  the client doesn't die on shutdown.

Thu Feb 25 14:44:40 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.cpp:
          Fixed a typo, still another timeprobe error - not sure
          what was intended, will email doc_group.

Thu Feb 25 12:41:08 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/Orbix: Updated the Makefiles to
          use the newer dependencies.  Thanks to Uma Markandu
          <umam@nortelnetworks.com> for reporting this.

Thu Feb 25 11:38:48 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): Still allow the use of
          -ORBdemuxstrategy but spit out a warning when used.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Don't remove
          temporary files on Win95/98.  Thanks to Rod Joseph
          <rodjoseph@adt.com> for reporting the problem.

        * docs/Options.html: Added a short note about the change of
          -ORBdemuxstrategy.

Thu Feb 25 09:27:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          Use interpretive marshaling by default, at least until unions
          work correctly.

Wed Feb 24 23:21:53 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECSupplier.cpp:
          added #include <ace/Get_Opt.h>

Wed Feb 24 22:54:59 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.i (_svc_conf): This new function allows user to
          overwrite TAO_DEFAULT_*_ARGS settings at application's main
          without recompiling TAO library.  Notice these settings are
          further overwritten by external svc.conf files because svc.conf
          files are parsed before these fake entries.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf: -ORBdemuxstrategy
          has become -ORBsystemidpolicydemuxstrategy now.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static: Fixed
          static service's names.  Changed to use
          -ORBsystemidpolicydemuxstrategy.

        * tao/orbconf.cpp: Fixed TAO_DEFAULT_*_ARGS.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/default_client.cpp:
        * tao/default_server.cpp: Corrected names of the static services.

Wed Feb 24 17:08:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

          Fixed explicit template instantiations.

Wed Feb 24 16:01:53 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp: Fred and I fixed up Location Forward logic in
          do_static_call ().  It wasn't advancing the profiles when a
          location forward message was returned.

Wed Feb 24 14:13:03 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/index.html: Added a link to
          $ACE_ROOT/docs/exceptions.html.

Wed Feb 24 11:45:29 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>
        * Added a test for multiple profile forwarding.  This
          test verifies the Stub methods by duplicating
          the forwarding and request handling logic in wrappers.
          tests/Multiple_Profiles/forwarding.cpp

Wed Feb 24 11:40:08 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Stub.cpp - changed goto two_way to goto one_way

Wed Feb 24 11:07:32 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Updated how forwarding is performed so that multiple
          profiles are used.  This following files were modified.
          These is still an issue with concurrency since the Stub object is
          responsible for managing the profile list and forwarding
          information.
          IIOP_Profile.cpp
          IIOP_Profile.h

Tue Feb 23 20:10:52 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Added EC_ObserverStrategy to the set of files for Event2

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp:
          Implemented delayed and/or immediate removal and additions from
          the ConsumerAdmin internal set (of ProxyPushSupplier). This is
          important to applications that use reactive dispatching and can
          generate disconnections and/or connections to the EC as part of
          the consumer upcalls.
          This strategies require condition variables and thus the use of
          templates to parametrize the locking strategy.
          I also added a simple policy to control the level of concurrency
          in the ConsumerAdmin set: the user can specify how many threads
          can be concurrently running on the ConsumerAdmin.  If this limit
          is exceeded then the new threads must wait until all the other
          threads leave.  At that point the delayed operations are
          executed.
          This strategy ensures that operations are not delayed forever;
          setting the HWM to 1 (the default) ensures that operations are
          executed before the next upcall; setting the HWM to a very high
          value results in maximum concurrency; this could be a reasonable
          options if periodically there are periods without any activity.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp:
          Added missing destructor.
          Minor cosmetic changes.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Added reference counting to this objects.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Busy_Lock.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Busy_Lock.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Busy_Lock.cpp:
          A simple adapter that conforms to the ACE_Lock interface. It
          invokes the busy() and idle() method on another object to
          acquire and release.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.cpp:
          Implemented two simple Command objects that can invoke the
          connected_i() and disconnected_i() methods on another class,
          this are useful to implement the delayed connection and
          disconnection from the EC.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
          Use the new EC_ConsumerAdmin types with the right locking
          strategies.

        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.h:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.h:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:

        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.h:
          The test is more flexible wrt event types subscribed by each
          consumer and published by the suppliers, this could be useful to
          measure how the test scales with the number of consumers and/or
          suppliers.

        * orbsvcs/RtecEventComm.idl:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic changes.

Tue Feb 23 19:44:20 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root/root.cpp:
        Added context state
        Tahnks to Mason Taube

Tue Feb 23 18:11:11 1999 Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Callback_Quoter/Callback_Quoter.dsw:
          examples/Callback_Quoter/Notifier.dsp:
          examples/Callback_Quoter/Consumer.dsp:
          examples/Callback_Quoter/Supplier.dsp:
          Changes due to the removal of the ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE directive
          from the stubs and skeletons generated by the tao_idl compiler.
          This directive caused compiler errors using MSVC 5.0. It went
          through when compiled with MSVC 6.0.

Tue Feb 23 16:53:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp (run):
          removed old comment that server shutdown would cause a
          memPartFree on VxWorks.  It no longer does.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.{h,cpp}
          (sched_fifo_init): removed SCHED_PARAMS_FIFO macro, because
          it's not needed, fixed name of program in comment.

Tue Feb 23 15:24:46 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          Fixed some more g++ warnings in generated code. It was
          unused arg in the case of the union and an
          unnecessary ACE_NOTREACHED in the case of the objref. If
          g++ is going to complain now about this, we might need
          to add it to the list in the #define of ACE_NOTREACHED.

Sun Feb 21 18:59:15 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.5 released.

Sun Feb 21 17:29:28 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/server.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/bank/AccountManager_i.cpp:
        Fixed compilation error in EGCS compiler

Sun Feb 21 16:54:46 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MProfile.i:
          Modifed TAO_MProfile::get_prev() and
          TAO_MProfile::get_current_profile() to always return a value -
          warning turned up in VC 6.0.

Sun Feb 21 16:38:15 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Took care of
        #includes with <>'s  in the idl files. Thanks to Mark Little
        <M.C.Little@ncl.ac.uk> for pointing this out.

Sun Feb 21 09:07:38 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Driver.cpp (dump_results):
          fixed 64-to-32 bit conversions so that they operate on the
          64-bit quantity directly, instead of a quotient.  And, divide
          by a float instead of an int, to use floating point division.
          Thanks to Souhad Mcheik <mcheiks@inrs-telecom.uquebec.ca> for
          reporting that the code attempted to convert an unsigned 64-bit
          integer to a double.  That's not supported by MSVC++ 5.0.

Sat Feb 20 21:09:49 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/Bank_Client_i.h:
        * examples/Simple/bank/client.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/bank/server.cpp:
        Made changes to the TAO_TRY macros

Sat Feb 20 15:55:01 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile: moved TAO_IDLFLAGS override to
          after includes, so that any settings in platform_macros.GNU
          are not lost.

Sat Feb 20 000:28:57 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/InconsistentTypeCodeC.h:
          Added title and description to the class header.

Fri Feb 19 23:12:58 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
          Updated to the new request arg manipulation functions.
          Commented out cube_union for the present until compiled
          marshaling gets finished for unions.

Fri Feb 19 22:53:19 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/Pluggable: Began to add support for CORBA operation
          calls that can timeout.  Thanks to Kevin Royalty
          <kroyalty@mdc.com> for suggesting this.

Fri Feb 19 21:52:45 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: The Twoway_Invocation class was re-fetching
          the profile and transport objects *after* sending the
          request. But during a nested upcall the transport hint in the
          current profile can change (if an invocation over the same
          object reference is required).  The solution is to keep a
          reference to the transport object in the stack and pass it down
          to the invoke_i() method of the GIOP_Invocation class.  Thanks
          to Hans Horsmann <Hans.Horsmann@icn.siemens.de> for reporting
          this bug.

Thu Feb 18 20:07:10 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_factory.cpp:
          Added missing context states in the TAO_Compiled_Visitor_Factory
          for servant implementation files Thanks to Mason Taube
          <taube@westcon.prc.com> for bringing it to our notice.

Thu Feb 18 17:28:43 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/dynany_test/Makefile: Fixed a line that needed to
          start with a tab. Thanks to Hakan Kallberg <hk@simulina.se> for
          reporting this.

Thu Feb 18 00:50:10 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MProfile.cpp: Need to include MProfile.i here when not
          inlined.

Wed Feb 17 17:57:01 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP_ORB.cpp MProfile.cpp MProfile.h ORB.cpp Stub.cpp
          Stub.h Stub.i decode.cpp MProfile.i
          Inlined many of the MProfile methods
          Also, changed MProfile so it could assume ownership of
          a profile, thus saving a lock.

Wed Feb 17 10:45:28 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp:
          I added an strategy to support the Event Channel observers. The
          Event Channel uses this strategy to implement the
          append_observer(), remove_observer() methods and it informs the
          strategy of any changes in the set of consumers and/or
          suppliers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl:
          The operation remove_observer can also raise a
          SYNCHRONIZATION_ERROR exception

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.h:
          Added a typedef for the HeaderSet iterator.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.cpp:
          Made the iterator over the set of consumers a public interface.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

Tue Feb 16 17:15:12 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/vb.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/ab.{h,cpp}
          Defined a new VideoBuffer () class for the Video buffering
          process and AudioBuffer class for the audio buffering process
          and used the reactor for i/o handling instead of
          blocking i/o calls. Also uses a socketpair between the control
          process for exit notifications which eliminates the SIGUSR*
          signals. Also replaced the exit () calls with reactor
          end_event_loop so that the processes exit cleanly.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/Command_Handler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/vd.cpp:
          Replaced the SIGUSR signals code with socket notification code.

Tue Feb 16 16:48:28 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp} (print_exception): Added this
          method to print out the exception type in a human readable
          form.  This is not CORBA compliant and should never be used
          directly in user code.

        * tao/Environment.cpp (print_exception): Changed to use _narrow to
          determine if we have a SystemException or not.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (location_forward): Changed to use
          ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION.

Tue Feb 16 16:45:38 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
          Fixed warning due to unproper use of ACE_TRY macros, this time
          the warning was *very* significant.

Mon Feb 15 21:22:55 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/post_upcall_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/pre_docall_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/upcall_ss.cpp:
          Some g++ unused arg warning fixes I overlooked checking in.

Mon Feb 15 17:24:52 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Invocation.i:
          replaced all the TAO_TRY macros with their ACE_ equivalents.

Mon Feb 15 16:24:42 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/CDR/Makefile:
        * tests/CDR/allocator.cpp:
          Added a new test to measure the effect of using TSS allocators
          in the CDR streams.

Mon Feb 15 13:26:29 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.4 released.

Mon Feb 15 10:45:10 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_compiled_cs.cpp:

          Jeff's changes are now valid only for the "inout" paramater and
          not to the "out" parameter.

Mon Feb 15 09:11:27 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument.h:

          Jeff had forgotten to #include the newly added files that he
          mentioned in his ChangeLog below. Due to this, we wre getting
          compile errors.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_cs.h:

          Once again, Jeff had forgotten to add the visit_string method to
          the class declaration, although he had provided the
          implementation.

Sun Feb 14 18:29:50 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_compiled_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_factory.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_cs.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation/arglist.h:
          Added post_invoke string_free() for INOUT and OUT strings, and
          release() for OUT objects, to plug a leak found with Purify.
          Added the compiled marshaling version classes for this as well.
          Changed the spot where post_invoke lines are generated, plus
          some other cosmetic fixes.

Sun Feb 14 12:41:55 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Pluggable.cpp:
          We must always check the environment after passing it down to
          another function.

        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:

        * tao/POAC.cpp:
        * tao/Typecode_Constants.cpp:
        * tao/orbconf.h:
          Several cosmetic fixes, mostly trailing spaces removed.

Sat Feb 13 17:52:01 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Changed the following to make the time returned in units of 100
        nanoseconds instead of seconds.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Server.cpp :
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp) :
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp :

Sat Feb 13 01:11:52 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server/Property_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server/augmented_server.cpp:
          Replaced the  _env environment variable usages with the TAO_IN_ENV
          parameters.

Fri Feb 12 22:04:31 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
          Added new methods to create the locking strategies in the
          ProxyPushConsumer and ProxyPushSupplier.
          The Null_Factory uses ACE_Lock_Adapter<ACE_Null_Mutex>, the
          Basic_Factory uses ACE_Lock_Adapter<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX>.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          The ProxyPushSupplier uses the new locking strategies.
          A couple of private _i methods were added to avoid dead-locks.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.cpp:
          The dispatching strategy receives the consumer object reference
          from the ProxyPushSupplier, otherwise it has to make an upcall
          and incurs in a dead-lock.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic changes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Added dependencies for the new Event2 service.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
          Added some comments.

          and I may have missed a file or two. I'll build what I can

          thread-per-connection example back to IDL_Cubit.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/collocation_test.dsp:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: Changed to

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.{h,cpp}
          tao/ORB.cpp
          tao/Stub.{i,cpp}
          Modified Stub and IIOP_Profile creation to use the cached
          address info in the orb_core.  Thanks to Dr. David A. Janello
          <argon@mcs.net> for reporting this performance problem.

        * Modified tao/Stub.i to not print warning messages with a
          forwarded request is itself forwarded.  Since the multiple
          profile code and forwarding is still in development I left a
          debug message.

          monotonic scaling of windows for the dual EC demo.

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{cpp, h}
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.{cpp, h}:
          added dummy registrations to schedulers to ensure priority
          separation for high and low priority channels, put all threads
          in DualEC_Sup process into the realtime scheduling class.

        * TAO/performance-tests/cubit/tao/idl_cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
          Took out one too many "unused args". Had to put one back.
          Thanks to Nanbor for pointing this out.

Thu Feb 11 16:01:17 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp: Changed the ior_read () method
          to use ACE_Read_Buffer instead of fscanf (). Also ran purify on
          this. Got 0 memory leaks.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.h (class Clerk_i): Changed ior_fp_
          from FILE * to int. Used an ACE_HANDLE instead of FILE*.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AVStreams.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp :
        Fixed the problem with marshalling/demarshalling multiple
        exceptions. Also changed PropertyException from exception to struct
        the CosPropertyService.idl file, as suggested by OMG. But, AVStreams
        is not updated by OMG yet. All the instances of "raises
        CosPropertyService::PropertyException" in AVStreams.idl has been
        changed to "raises AVStreams::PropertyException". Thanks to Carlos for
        the great help in debugging exception marshalling problem. Thanks to
        Ulf  <jaehrig@desys.com> for the bug report.

        this.

Thu Feb 11 11:28:44 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp:
        removed an extra #pragma from the file.

Thu Feb 11 11:23:05 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.cpp:
          The GreenHills compiler (at least versions 1.8.8 and 1.8.9 of
          it) gets really confused by some template forward
          declarations. We had to re-arrange the includes to match the
          compiler liking.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:
          Need to include ORB_Core.h in platforms that do not support
          svc.conf or when tao is using a static services.

Thu Feb 11 10:34:41 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Use of PHandle in MProfile.{h,cpp} create a name conflict.
          Added TAO_ to fix this.

        * Thanks to  John Morey <jmorey@tbi.com>
          for reminding me of the ACE-Guidelines ;).

Thu Feb 11 02:51:34 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init): Only initialize the ORB global variables
          _after_ the ORB has been initialized.  Otherwise, the
          init_orb_globals() will create a server_strategy_factory (as TAO
          is now) before we have a chance to initialize it.

          This bug was causing grief in POA registration test. Thanks to
          David A. Janello <argno@mcs.net> for reporting the bug.

Wed Feb 10 23:50:11 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp (handle_input): It is unfotunate that an
          exception (probably a system exception) was thrown by the upcall
          code (even by the user) when the client was not expecting a
          response.  However, in this case, we cannot close the connection
          down, since it really isn't the client's fault.

          Thanks to Mark L. Boriack <mboriack@std.saic.com> for helping in
          tracking down this problem.

Wed Feb 10 23:15:27 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp : Fixed a bug for the service
          not working on NT with files. The initialization of the
          ACE_Array_Base was not being done in the right place.  Thanks to
          Souhad Mcheik <mcheiks@inrs-telecom.uquebec.ca> for reporting
          this.

Wed Feb 10 22:16:01 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Fixed off-by-one error with
          calculating dynamic string length.

Wed Feb 10 19:39:27 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Using
          ACE_DEFAULT_TEMP_FILE for generating gperf input file. Thanks to
          Lothar Werzinger <lwerzinger@krones.de> for suggesting this.

Wed Feb 10 18:55:09 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Changed Stub.i, set_fwd_profiles () so it doesn't
          complain about fwd_profiles which are themselves forwarded.

Wed Feb 10 17:17:46 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp:
          I had to zero out the buffer to generate identical Typecodes on
          all platforms, including the padding bytes (which are now
          zeros). Thanks to Jim Crossley <JCrossley@mobsec.com> for
          chasing down the problems with this code and for suggesting that
          we test it out by comparing the output of different IDL
          compilers; this showed that the padding bytes were not
          initialized.

Wed Feb 10 16:36:41 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{i,cpp}:
          Streamlined the new arg manipulation helper functions.
          They're now short enought to be inlined.

Wed Feb 10 14:22:34 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Enabled the unused variable warning again. It compiles cleanly
          enough on Linux/EGCS.

Wed Feb 10 14:11:07 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/NVList.cpp:
          Added a method to Any called _tao_replace(). NVList method
          add_value() called Any::replace(). A bug report pointed
          out that, in the case where the Any arg to add_value() has been
          copy-constructed or assigned to, its value_ is 0, and
          replace() deals only with value_. _tao_replace is now
          called in add_value() if the value_ of the Any arg is 0,
          and _tao_replace() uses the Any's message block instead. A
          simple test adapted from the bug report code runs ok now
          with no leaks. Thanks to Barry Hoggard for reporting this
          bug.

Wed Feb 10 13:05:17 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h (pdf): Moved struct
          Observer_Entry into the public part of the class to avoid
          problems with the SGI compiler.  Thanks to Eric Mitchell
          <emitchell@altaira.com> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 10 10:39:09 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.cpp:
          To use TAO_RETHROW the methods must use TAO_IN_ENV as the
          incoming CORBA_Environment argument.

        * tao/Typecode.i:
          Removed unused argument in kind()

Wed Feb 10 10:28:16 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp (add_ior):
        Fixed a warning by cxx.

Tue Feb  9 22:26:52 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the class IOR_LookupTable which is an abstraction over the
        Hash_Map_Manager to store the object_name -> IOR mappings that
        will be used by the resolve_initial_references ().

        Updated the Makefile to include this class.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:

Tue Feb  9 22:11:08 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:
          The generated code contained a variable that was not used in all
          cases. Now we only generate the variable if we actually use it.

Tue Feb  9 22:06:12 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.h: Added Title and description
          comments to the class declaration.

Tue Feb  9 21:40:29 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/examples/Event_Comm/*.cpp
        Changed all the TAO_* macros for exceptions to
        ACE_* macros. This went clean on SunOSC++.


Tue Feb  9 20:38:24 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/cdr_op_cs.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          Added new visitor to generate the variable declarations required
          for marshaling certain kind of fields.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_structure/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          Use the new visitor to generate field declarations.

Tue Feb  9 20:43:13 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/examples/Callback_Quoter/*.cpp
        Changed all the TAO_* macros for exceptions to
        ACE_* macros. This went clean on SunOSC++ and
        SunOSg++

Tue Feb  9 17:55:31 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/Object.cpp:
        * tao/Object.i:
        * tao/POA.h:
          Fixed several g++ errors and warnings, the main problem was that
          g++ could not cope with this code:

          class CORBA {
          public:
            int foo ();
            void bar (int x = CORBA::foo ());
          };

          I had to create two versions of the bar() method (actually
          ORB_init()).  It also had some problems with the order of
          definition of some inline methods (which I was able to solve)
          and it required the definition (not only forward declarations)
          of some templates before some templates could be instantiated.
          Overall a small set of re-arrangment of includes and
          declarations. We have to test in other platforms now.

Tue Feb  9 17:53:42 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/configurations.html:
          Changed the first entry under Homogeneous Systems to reflect the
          move of tao/orbconf.h/TAO_DISABLE_SWAP_ON_READ to
          ace/OS.h/ACE_DISABLE_SWAP_ON_READ.

Tue Feb  9 16:52:41 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp (gen_typecode): Thanks to
        Carlos. Fixed the problem with the typecode generation for the
        exceptions.

Tue Feb  9 16:39:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_decl.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_enum.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_enum_val.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_field.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_structure.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp:
          The name2long() function was using a <long> but it needed a
          32-bit type; the right type to use is a ACE_UINT32.  This fixes
          some strange problems in 64-bit machines, like Alphas.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
          Fixed the ACE_DEBUG calls, they should be protected by the
          TAO_debug_level.

Tue Feb  9 13:47:37 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h:
        Changed the definition of TAO_IN_ENV to ACE_TRY_ENV


Mon Feb  8 17:09:03 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/debug.h:
        * tao/debug.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/Stub.cpp:
        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
        * tests/NestedUpcall/Reactor/client.cpp:
          Removed all the references to dmsg(), dmsg1(), dexc() and
          similar debugging macros, that's what we have ACE_DEBUG() for!!

        * performance-tests/Thruput/TAO/client.cpp:
        * tests/Multiple_Inheritance/server.cpp:
          Another couple of files that relied on "tao/corba.h" to include
          "ace/Get_Opt.h"

Mon Feb 08 15:20:09 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/corbafwd.h:
          On NT we need to define DEBUG when _DEBUG is defined, but this
          definition was left on corba.h by mistake, now it is in
          corbafwd.h

        * tao/Invocation.h:
          MSVC++ doesn't know that a class and a struct are the same
          thing, and it complains when a structure is forward declared as
          a class; silly

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.cpp:
          MSVC++ gets confused by typedefs inside classes again.

        * tao/ORB_Strategies_T.cpp:
          Added missing #include.

        * tao/debug.cpp:
        * tao/debug.h:
          Fixed some #include problems.

Mon Feb  8 15:25:00 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/echo/Makefile
        * examples/Simple/echo/client.cpp
        * examples/Simple/echo/server.cpp
        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_i.cpp
        Replaced old TAO_TRY macros with ACE_TRY macros
        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_Client_i.cpp
        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_Client_i.h
        New files after removing Server_i.* and Client_i.*

Mon Feb  8 14:26:29 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynAnyC.cpp:
        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Added missing #include for template instantiations.

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Re-ordered includes, otherwise "ace/Dynamic_Service.h" does not
          have the proper context.

          Cleaned up the include madness, now all the files inside TAO
          include "tao/corbafwd.h" to obtain the CORBA namespace. This
          files includes very little (only "ace/CDR.h" and
          "tao/orbconf.h"); so it is lighter than including "tao/corba.h".
          External applications only need to include "tao/corba.h", as
          before, but this file has been trimmed down somewhat.
          There are still some dependencies between several header files
          in TAO (specially "tao/ORB_Core.h"), but this are minor compared
          to the previous situation.

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.cpp:
          This files make changes to the IIOP_Profile so they need to
          include "tao/IIOP_Profile.h" explicitly, notice that all the
          other files in TAO do not need to.

        * examples/POA/Default_Servant/server.cpp:
        * examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp:

        * tests/Param_Test/options.cpp:
          This files used the "fact" that "tao/corba.h" included
          "ace/Get_Opt.h".

        * All the Makefiles in TAO where updated.

Mon Feb  8 12:16:33 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_obj_sequence_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_obj_sequence_cs.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_unbounded_obj_sequence_cs.cpp:
          Changed to generate ACE_TRY_ENV instead of TAO_IN_ENV.

Mon Feb 08 00:52:18 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.3 released.

Mon Feb  8 00:00:02 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Makefile:
          Some binaries did not link both NavWeapC.o and NavWeapS.o, this
          is needed for colocation support.

Sun Feb  7 23:45:19 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Updated makefile dependencies in
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier

Sun Feb  7 22:31:01 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP_ORB.cpp, poa declared twice.

Sun Feb  7 21:35:17 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Stub.i - added initialization for type_id
          from arg repository_id.

Sun Feb  7 20:01:29 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.i (STUB_Object): Fixed warnings about repository_id
          being unused.  Thanks to David for reporting this.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp: Added some checks for failed memory
          allocation.

Sun Feb  7 16:57:55 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/Simple_util.cpp
        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client.cpp
        * examples/Simple/time/server.cpp
        * examples/Simple/grid/Grid_Client_i.cpp
        * examples/Simple/grid/server.cpp
        Changed TAO_TRY macros to ACE_TRY macros

Sun Feb  7 15:30:34 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp:
          Changed a line in is_equivalent(). The lhs of a ==
          operator comparing two Versions was actually a
          pointer to a Version.

Sun Feb  7 14:32:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DOVEBrowser.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DOVEBrowserApplet.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DemoCore.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/MTDataHandlerAdapter.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumerFactory.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/make.bat : strategized
          browser concurrency: can either use direct orb upcalls (default)
          or use queueing in active data handler adapter objects
          (via the -queue command line switch).

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{cpp, h}
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.{cpp, h}:
          fixed shutdown to ensure disconnection of the scheduler and EC
          servants, deregistration of these from the Naming Service.  Also
          added command line switches -n and -w to set the number of
          usec slept before generating each navigation or weapons event,
          respectively.

Sun Feb  7 11:44:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
          Fixed the -Gi parsing code, it was setting compiled marshaling
          to 1, it must be 0.

Sun Feb 07 11:19:13 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: changed #include protection
          from #if !defined to #ifndef.  This allows compilers that
          recognize the #ifndef ... #define ... #endif idiom
          to optimize their reads of #include files.

Sun Feb  7 01:06:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
          Yet another extraction operator for CDR streams (for
          CORBA::Char*).

Sun Feb  7 00:52:36 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/ECCM_Consumer.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/ECCM_Supplier.dsp:
          Changed the tao_idl.exe path to ACE_wrappers/bin.

Sat Feb  6 23:16:14 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          Activated compiled marshaling by default. IRIX/MIPSpro and
          Linux/EGCS are happy, and so seems Solaris/CC; the old behavior
          can be invoked using the -Gi IDL compiler option, or by setting
          the TAO_IDLFLAGS environment variable to "-Gi".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          A ACE_static_cast was used to remove constness, it should be
          ACE_const_cast.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/cdr_op_ch.cpp:
          Sometimes the array name is prefixed by an _, but the operator
          << and >> for CDR streams was generated by appending the _ to
          the complete name, not just the base name; this made the IRIX
          compiler very unhappy.

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
          Added the operator << for TAO_OutputCDR and "const CORBA::Char*"

Sat Feb 06 21:11:05 1999 Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * corba.h:
          Changed to reflect the renaming of the ACE filed to
          CDR_Stream.*

Sat Feb 06 20:41:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.dsp
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.dsw
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Logging_Sup.dsp:
          Redid NT project file for DualEC_Sup using MSVC++ 5.0, added
          dependencies for .\NavWeap.idl on ..\NavWeap.idl

Sat Feb  6 19:56:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Added << and >> operators for the TAO_*CDR classes; otherwise we
          get a lot of ambiguos definitions with the ACE_*CDR versions.

        * tao/orbconf.h:
          TAO_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES is enabled always, until somebody
          actually defines ACE_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES.

Sat Feb  6 17:50:16 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/README:
        Fixed the problem with get_property_value passing IOR

1999-02-06  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Added an exit(1)
          when the preprocessor fails so that tao_idl doesn't hang.

Sat Feb 06 07:55:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

  (new) * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/MTDataHandlerAdapter.java:
          Adapts data handler to be an active object that processes events
          enqueued by another thread.

Sat Feb 06 07:33:19 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode): removed break statement following
          a return, because some compilers claim that it's not
          reachable.

Sat Feb 06 01:20:53 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf: No need to
          specify THR_BOUND since it is now the default.

          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/make.bat : reorganized
          DOVE browser to accept events from multiple named event channels,
          using a set of named schedulers.  Synchronized the data handler,

          supplier infrastructure to be able to define an EC and scheduler
          per supplier proxy instance.  Added a new supplier, DualEC_Sup,
          which creates two event channels and two schedulers, then generates
          events and sends them over two channels.

Fri Feb  5 11:12:04 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

          The generated stubs were using IIOP_Object to access the CORBA
          object's underlying stub object. However, since the IIOP_Object
          class is now removed, we use the STUB_Object class.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.h:
          The Event Channel can receive a reference to the scheduler in
          its constructor, this reference is propagated to all the modules
          and used instead of the Scheduler_Factory singleton.
          This can be used to have more than one Event Channel for process
          or to simplify the testing of multiple Scheduling services.
          If no scheduler is specified the Event Channel bootstraps from
          the Scheduler_Factory as usual.

          It doesn't use the Scheduler_Factory anymore, this illustrates
          how the EC can receive the scheduler as an argument.


Fri Feb  5 02:33:05 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Fixed explicit template instantiations for the new collocation
          map, it may not work correctly though.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

Thu Feb 04 23:42:39 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp: It should now include Stub.i instead of
          STUB_Object.i.

        * tao/TAO[_Static].dsp: Removed IIOP_Object and added MProfile.

Thu Feb  4 22:18:13 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * added public destructor to TAO_IIOP_Profile

Thu Feb  4 21:33:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp:
          It included $ACE_ROOT/tao/IIOP_Profile.h explicitly, the file
          has been removed. I'm not sure if the program will work, but at
          least I could update the Makefile dependencies.

Thu Feb  4 19:18:51 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Multiple Profiles (MP).
          This required the modification of several files, deleting others
          as well as adding and removing classes.

        * Removed the files IIOP_Object.{h,i,cpp} and object IIOP_Object.
          All functionality now resided in the old base class STUB_Object.

        * Changed many files and classes to multiple profiles or to
          account for removing the IIOP_Object class.

           1) IIOP_Connector.cpp
           2) IIOP_ORB.{h,cpp}
              IIOP_ORB.cpp changed references from IIOP_Object and
              Client_Handler to STUB_Object and TAO_Transport.  Also
              moved much of the IIOP specific marsheling code to IIOP_Profile.
           3) Invocation.{h,i,cpp}
              Changed references from IIOP_Object to STUB_Object.
           4) ORB.{h,i,cpp}
           5) ORB_Core.{h,i,cpp}
           6) Object.{i,cpp}
           7) Servant_Base.cpp
           8) Server_Request.cpp
           9) Stub.{h,i,cpp}
              All logic from IIOP_Object (minus transport specific stuff) moved to
              the STUB_Object.  Also the MProfile class is used for storing all
              profiles.
          10) decode.cpp
              Changed IIOP_Object ref to STUB_Object
          11) encode.cpp
              Changed IIOP_Object ref to STUB_Object
          12) Any.h
              Changed "friend class IIOP_Object" to "friend class STUB_Object"
          13) corba.h
              Added #include's for the Multiple Profile header files.

Thu Feb  4 15:07:29 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * updated MT_Cubit/svc.conf to use THR_BOUND as the default.

          ACE_TRACE message.

Thu Feb  4 00:02:17 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Made sure _WIN32 doesn't get redefined.  Thanks
          to Terry Rosenbaum <Terry.Rosenbaum@Radiology.MSU.edu> for
          pointing this out.

Wed Feb 03 15:01:22 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (open_services): Do not try to parse the
          default svc.conf file is TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP is
          defined.  You can still use the -f command line option to open a
          specific svc.conf file.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.cpp:
          Use a RB_Tree to represent the set of event types required by a
          set of filters; this will let us implement the matching of
          consumers and suppliers more effificiently [O(nlog(n))]

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
          Call unbind() on the SupplierFiltering strategy, so it can
          release our resources.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp:

Tue Feb 02 09:22:31 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (create_stub_object): removed unused local
          "orb_core".

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode): removed return and continue statements
          following breaks, because some compilers complain that
          they're unreachable.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (do_sendv): added static cast of
          iov_len to size_t.  It avoids a compile warning about

        * idl_global.h
        * drv_args.cpp
        * be_codegen.cpp
        Added these two options to the tao_idl compiler.
        -in To generate #include statements with <>'s for the standard include
        files (e.g. tao/corba.h) indicating them as non-changing files.
        Thanks to Andreas Geisler <andreas.geisler@erls.siemens.de> for
        this suggestion.

        -ic To generate #include statements with ""s for changing standard

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.cpp:
        renamed variables named "ppc" to "proxypushconsumer" to fix the

Sat Jan 30 14:26:41 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added a new option -ORBInitRef to the ORB. The syntax is
        -ORBInitRef <ObjectID>=<IOR: ....  >.

        The option works for the IOR formats understandable by the
        string_to_object (). The string_to_object () will be modified later to
        understand other ior formats like iiopname, iioploc.

        The new option takes precedence over the current methods of resolving
        an initial reference to an arbitrary object ID
        (through resolve_initial_references ()).

        * tao/ORB.cpp  : Added a new function resolve_commandline_ref (). This
        function is called by the resolve_initial_references () to resolve a
        reference to an arbitrary object id specified in the -ORBInitRef param.
        * tao/ORB.h : Added the declaration for the above method.
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp : Added the new option -ORBInitRef in init (). Also
        set the init_ref parameter if this option is specified.
        * tao/params.h : Added a new parameter init_ref_. Also added declarations
        for the Get/Set methods of init_ref_.
        * tao/params.i : Defined the Get/Set methods for the init_ref_ parameter.
        * tao/params.cpp : Added the constructor initialization of the init_ref_.

Sat Jan 30 11:55:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf.cpp

          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf_Anomalies_Runtime.h
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf_Runtime.{cpp, h}: updated
          types that had been changed in RtecScheduler.idl.  Thanks to gwross
          <gwross@west.raytheon.com> for providing this ix, which solves a
          compilation problem with MSVC++ 6.0.

Sat Jan 30 10:08:17 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Generic_Servant/Makefile:
          The definition for the static library target was missing (LIB=)
          Thanks to Robert V. Head <rhead@virtc.com> for pointing this
          out.

        * examples/Event_Comm/Event_Comm_i.cpp:
          Fixed the instantiation pragmas. Thanks to Robert V. Head
          <rhead@virtc.com> for pointing this out.

Fri Jan 29 20:16:45 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/NVList.cpp:
          Changed add_value() to always copy the value of the Any,
          ignoring the CORBA::IN_COPY_VALUE flag. Calling replace(),
          as we did before, is faster, but if the value of the Any is
          0 (void* value is null), a crash will result. Thanks to
          Carlos for figuring this out and to Barry Hoggard for
          reporting the bug.

Fri Jan 29 18:07:28 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

          this was a mistake, I'm reverting the change.

Fri Jan 29 09:07:47 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf.cpp: use
          RtecScheduler::Criticality_t, Importance_t, and Info_Type_T.
          Thanks to gwross <gwross@west.raytheon.com> for providing this
          fix, which solves a compilation problem with MSVC++ 6.0.

Thu Jan 28 16:34:14 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added support for Pluggable Protocols (PP) This required the
          modification of several files, deleting others as well as adding
          and removing classes.

        * Added the following classes and files
          1) Pluggable.h - Contains all the base classes and registries
             used in Pluggable protocols.  New transport implementations
             will have
             to use these classes in order to 'plugin' to the framework.
             a) TAO_Profile
             b) TAO_Connector
             c) TAO_Transport
             d) TAO_Acceptor
             e) TAO_Connector_Registry
             Pluggable.cpp - Connector_Registry implementation and Profile
             Version class.  Each transport specific TAO_[*]_Connector
             registers itself with this singleton.
          2) IIOP_Profile.{h,cpp}
             Class TAO_IIOP_Profile is defined here and it profides IIOP
             specific processing.  Much of the transport specific
             processing located in the IIOP_Object has been relocated
             to here.
             In particular an IIOP_Profile will contain a reference to the
             currently used transport, that is the connection handler.
          3) IIOP_Connector.{h,cpp}
             All transport specific connection processing is hidden behind
             this class. The connection handler hint () is taken from the
             TAO_Profile (i.e. IIOP_Profile) object.
          4) IIOP_Acceptor - basically just a transport neutral wrapper
             for the Acceptor.

        * Changed many files and classes to use this new transport
          independent Pluggable classes.  Also relocated transport
          specific processing to the new classes.
          1) Connect.{h,cpp}
             Created new base classes TAO_IIOP_Client_Transport and
             TAO_IIOP_Server_Transport in order to keep TAO_Transport
             references and leverage dynamic binding.  That is, all
             handlers use either of these classes as a base class.
             TAO_SVC_HANDLER is a member object.

             Edited code so it passed TAO_Transport object references to
             GIOP::send_request and GIOP::recv_request.
          2) GIOP.{h,cpp}
             Replaced all references to the handler object with the new
             transport object.  Also moved all transport specific code
             used for reading and writing messages to the network to the
             new IIOP_Transport class.
          3) IIOP_ORB.{h,cpp}
             IIOP_ORB.h -> got rid of the #include "tao/corba.h"
             moved much of the IIOP specific marsheling code to IIOP_Profile.
          4) Invocation.{h,i,cpp}
             use TAO_Transport and TAO_Profile instead of Client_Handler and
             IIOP_Object::IIOP.
             Additionally, the connection is now made by the
             Connector_Registry object.
             All IIOP specific processing moved to TAO_IIOP_Profile.
          5) ORB.{h,i,cpp}
             The preconnect method's functionality is moved to
             Connector_Registry and TAO_[*]_Profile.
          6) ORB_Core.{h,i,cpp}
             The ORB_Core was changed to allocate memory for the new
             objects: TAO_Connector_Registry, TAO_IIOP_Connector and
             TAO_IIOP_Acceptor. Preconnect () moved also.
          7) Servant_Base.cpp
             Changed to use STUB_Object refs rather than IIOP_Object.
          8) Server_Request.cpp
             Changed to use STUB_Object refs rather than IIOP_Object.
          9) decode.cpp
             Moved all IIOP specific processing (parsing IORs) to
             IIOP_Profile.
         12) encode.cpp
             Moved all IIOP specific processing (parsing IORs) to
             IIOP_Profile.
         13) params.{h,i,cpp}
             Changed use_IIOP_lite_protocol to use_lite_protocol.
         14) corba.h
             Added #include's for the new Pluggable Protocol header
             files.

          hack to open the tmp_file in the "correct" status on Win32 so
          the tmp_file will get removed automatically.

          We need to reimplement ACE_OS::fopen to make it behave the same
          as on other platforms at some later point.

          (DRV_copy_input): Changed to use ACE_OS::f* functions.  It
          doesn't really make any difference here because the temp file
          get closed before unlink.

Mon Jan 18 11:20:10 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Fixed a problem with indirected type codes, thanks to Slava
          Galperin <galperin@teknowledge.com> for detecting the problem
          and providing us with a patch for it.

        * examples/Simple/time/server.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client_i.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiations.

Mon Jan 18 01:16:53 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Replaced TAO try macros with ACE try macros.

        * tao/try_macros.h: Source in ace/CORBA_macros.h so we can start
          switching over to the new macros.  Most of the macros in this
          file will be gone once we finish the transition.

Mon Jan 18 00:25:40 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.52 released.

Sun Jan 17 16:15:10 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.h:
        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
          Checked the return value of some send_n() calls, at least to
          print appropiate debug messages if TAO_orbdebug is not 0.
          Also added constants to document the size of the IIOP_Lite
          header (vs. the GIOP header) and the offset of the message size
          in the GIOP and the IIOP_Lite headers.

Sun Jan 17 15:51:39 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service_Server.dsp: Added the generated
        files of ImplRepo to the project .dsp. This is required till the
        ImplRepo idl files are moved to the orbsvcs/orbsvcs directory.

Sun Jan 17 15:41:12 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/TAOACE_Static.dsw: Removed outdated project files.

        * TAO/TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/tao_idl_static.dsp:
        * TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp:
        * TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs_static.dsp:
        * TAO/tao/TAO.dsp:
        * TAO/tao/TAO_Static.dsp: Rearranged the intermediate directory
          for DLL/LIB build to avoid confusing the build utility in VC.

Sun Jan 17 15:34:17 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp (wait_until_ready):
          Replaced ACE_Thread_Mutex with ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that this will
          compile properly with threads=0.  Thanks to Russ Noseworthy for
          reporting this!

Sat Jan 16 22:54:14 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp (DRV_check_gperf):
          Added ability to check for a gperf program with a name other
          than "gperf."  This modification complements the change that
          was made to TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp a few months ago that
          allowed TAO to use a gperf with a name besides "gperf."  As before,
          define the ACE_GPERF macro like so:
                         -DACE_GPERF=\"gperf-ace\"
          for example, to specify a perfect hash function generator called
          "gperf-ace."

Sat Jan 16 11:49:45 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp (add_to_included_idl_files):
          Change line 515 from: this->n_included_idl_files_ += INCREMENT;
          to: this->n_allocated_idl_files_ += INCREMENT;
          so that tao_idl won't crash when including 64 or more files.
          Thanks to Tommy Andreasen <tommy.andreasen@radiometer.dk>
          for reporting this.

Fri Jan 15 19:11:10 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client_i.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client_i.h:
        Added permissions for these files.

Fri Jan 15 18:43:02 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client_i.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client_i.h:
        New files added for implementing the Templates for
        a single client/server model

        * examples/Simple/time/Time_i.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/time/Time_i.h:
        * examples/Simple/time/server.cpp:
        * examples/Simple/time/client.cpp:
        Made  changes in a way such that server and client
        make instantiations of templates with their interface
        objects.

        * examples/Simple/Simple_Util.h:
        * examples/Simple/Simple_Util.cpp:
        New files that have the template definitions and
        implementation of those methods.

Fri Jan 15 17:24:36 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Client_i.cpp (init): Checked the return value
        of the obtain_initial_references () for the client to die gracefully
        in the absence of a clerk. Thanks to Ulf for pointing out this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Client_i.h : Removed explicit qualification
        of the method test_for_secure_universal_time (). Thanks to Ulf for
        pointing out this.

Fri Jan 15 14:25:29 1999  Seth Widoff  <swidoff@thalia.cimds.ri.cmu.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TT_Info.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/colocated_test.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/export_test.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/import_test.cpp:
        Added the -iorfile or -i option to the export and import
        test. When provided a file name, the tests read the trader IOR
        from the file, else from standard input. Fixed some formating in
        the remaining files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Service_Type_Repository.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.cpp:
        More "clever" uses of sequence buffers to avoid copying broke
        when the memory mangement of string sequences changed
        recently. Resorted to good, ol' fashioned copying. There shouldn't
        be any more of these lurking around.

Fri Jan 15 08:21:55 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.51 released.

Fri Jan 15 03:52:22 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/exceptions.html: Removed most entries in this file.  Added
          redirection to the new exception handling guideline page.

Fri Jan 15 01:47:41 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.50 released.

Fri Jan 15 00:35:24 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/run_test.pl : Added this perl script to test
        run the time service. The script offers options to run the service
        using either of the following :
          - Implementation Repository
          - Naming Service
          - Files
        The script runs only a single server because at this time I dont
        know how to start servers on different machines with the same
        script. Also the IR doesnt allow to run its multiple copies in
        the same directory because it writes implrepo.ior to the current
        directory.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/implrepo.conf : Added this file. This doesnt
        really belong here but anything which needs to run the IR needs
        this file.

Thu Jan 14 23:50:25 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo/usersguide.html:
        * docs/implrepo/index.html:
        * docs/implrepo/status.html:
          Added and collected most of the information on the
          Implementation Repository.  The main addition was a rough
          User's Guide which should help people use the IR.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
        * docs/index.html:
          Now point to the correct IR stuff.

Thu Jan 14 23:32:19 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/Makefile: Changed to incorporate the
        right path for Repository.o file. The make was throwing a link
        error.

Thu Jan 14 22:10:49 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h: Added comments to indication the macros in the
          file has been depricated.

Thu Jan 14 15:39:34 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp (check_unexpected_data): Only print the closing
          connection message when TAO_orbdebug is on.

Thu Jan 14 15:52:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/Makefile
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/Makefile
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Makefile

Thu Jan 14 14:07:17 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{h,i,cpp}:
          Added the argument manipulation helper functions, as shown
          in the C++ mapping of ORBOS 98-09-03.

Thu Jan 14 11:51:31 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h,
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Service_Type_Repository.h: Changed a
          private: to public: to fix a problem on IRIX 6.4.  Thanks to
          Eric Mitchell <emitchell@altaira.com> for reporting this.

Thu Jan 14 02:46:56 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.49 released.

Thu Jan 14 00:52:48 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (run): Added a new version of the run() method.
          This variant takes no timeout parameters and hence does not
          terminate the event loop if the Reactor returns a 0.  This
          variant is necessary for TAO to work correctly with Reactor
          implementations such as XtReactor that returns zero even when
          the timeout does not expire.

          Thanks to JM Strauss <jms97@club-internet.fr> for suggesting
          this change.

          Also, fixed the timeout by reference version of the run() method
          such that it no longer pretends to be dealing with const
          timeouts.

Wed Jan 13 14:56:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.cpp
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Logging_Sup.cpp: fixed string
          members of IDL structs by using .inout () to obtain lvalue.

Wed Jan 13 09:50:16 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp: removed ACE_Equal_To<ACE_CString>
          explicit instantiation because it's in tao/POA.cpp.

Tue Jan 12 20:10:16 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp (send_request): Changed to use sendv_n to do vector
          write.

Tue Jan 12 19:13:07 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
          fixed a seg fault that happened on program exit if <parse_args>
          failed. Now, <init_ORB> is called before anything else.

Tue Jan 12 18:04:33 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.i: Fixed a memory leak in bounded sequences.
          Thanks to Patrice Bensoussan <pbensoussan@amadeus.net> for
          helping us track this down.

Tue Jan 12 13:09:06 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.{h,cpp}: Fixed some warning
          producing code.

Tue Jan 12 10:48:15 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.{i,cpp} (TAO_Unbounded_Sequence::operator[]):
          uninlined to avoid build (template instantiation) problems with
          Sun C++ 4.2 patch 104631-07.  Thanks to Magnus Karlsson
          <magnus.karlsson@syncom.se> for confirming that this solves the
          problem.

Tue Jan 12 08:46:42 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp:

          In the patch applied mentioned in the ChangeLog below, we were
          using the keyword "true" in a while loop. Unfortunately, it is
          not supported by SunCC. So we use the value 1 to represent a
          "true" value.

Mon Jan 11 22:56:26 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao_idl/include/utl_scope.h:
        * tao_idl/util/utl_scope.cpp:
          Added a patch sent in by Hamish Friedlander. This patch
          modified his previous patch (which enabled re-opening of
          modules) to further enable scoped lookups on these
          re-opened modules.

Mon Jan 11 21:20:23 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp (send_request): Fixed typos.

Mon Jan 11 19:40:25 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent:
          for all files in this directory -
          replaced TAO_TRY_ENV with TAO_IN_ENV

Mon Jan 11 16:55:57 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP: removed entire directory tree.

Mon Jan 11 16:36:08 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Added a section for the forthcoming Interface Repository

Mon Jan 11 13:15:15 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Changed the implementation to use the new send_n()
          method on SOCK_Stream.  This enabled me to be able to remove the
          adhoc use of writev_n() in this file.

Mon Jan 11 12:37:23 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Dereferenced the _var pointers in the following.
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init_IR):
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (create_server):

Mon Jan 11 02:10:05 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_THROW_ENV_RETURN): Forgot to removed
          duplicate definition.

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_CATCHALL): For compilers without c++
          exceptions, simply make it identical to TAO_CATCHANY.  Thanks,
          to Irfan for suggesting the change.

        * TAO.h: Standardized the name of CORBA_Environment argument in
          functions.  This is an effort trying to simplify the use of TAO
          try macros.

        * tao/try_macros.h: Removed TAO_THROW_ENV_RETURN_VOID.  It's
          identical to TAO_THROW_ENV.
          Changed to use TAO_CHECK_ENV_RETURN and
          TAO_CHECK_ENV_RETURN_VOID to define TAO_CHECK_RETURN and
          TAO_CHECK_RETURN_VOID.

        * docs/exceptions.html: Added a section "In a nutshell" which
          covers 99% of the use case of TAO try macros.

Sun Jan 10 16:36:24 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the following to the Time Service.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/README:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/README:

Sun Jan 10 15:36:44 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Makefile: Added the following rule to make
        sure the ImplRepo_Service is uptodate.
        include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/rules.nested.GNU

        There would be no need for this once the files in the
        ImplRepo_Service are moved to the proper directories.

Sun Jan 10 02:57:26 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp: Fixed template instantiation
          problems and member re-ordereding problems.

Sat Jan  9 22:50:35 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp : Added the Implementation
        repository related functions. Made changes to incorporate the
        additional functionality required by the IR.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h : Addded member variables and
        functions required by the IR.

        The following files are required by the server. These files
        would have to be removed from here once the IR stabilizes and
        these files are put in a particular directory.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.cpp
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.h
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/implrepo.conf

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Makefile : Changed the Makefile to link
        in the IR_Helper and other objects required by the Implementation
        Repository.

Sat Jan  9 22:06:09 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp
          (connect_push_supplier): Changed to use TAO_IN_ENV.

        * tao/try_macros.h: Added a new macro definition TAO_IN_ENV which
          maps to _env.  The purpose of adding this macro is to make the
          use of TAO try macros more readable.  From now on, we should
          always use TAO_IN_ENV to name the CORBA environment passed in
          from function arguments.  TAO_TRY_ENV should only be used within
          TAO_TRY block.

Sat Jan  9 14:53:15 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.cpp:
          dereferenced uses of _var with .in ()

Fri Jan  8 18:06:11 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent:
          These changes are across all the files in this directory...
          1. prefixed each class name with TAO_CosEC_
          2. changed all member *_ptr to *_var, removed calls to <release>.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp:
          1. <push> now uses an <EventSet> that does not own the buffer.
          2. ACE_NEW replaced with ACE_NEW_THROW.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.cpp:
          ACE_NEW replaced with ACE_NEW_THROW.
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.h:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.h:
          Changed EventChannel_i to TAO_CosEC_EventChannel_i.

        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp.cpp:
          Further attempt to correct bug report by Ron Barack. I will ask
          Andy to check my changes.

Fri Jan  8 13:49:30 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp (run): Changed to
          use TAO_CATCHANY and TAO_CATCHALL.

Fri Jan 08 13:10:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/clnt.cpp: added .out () to
          TAO_String_Manager idl structure fields that are being passed to
          strcpy calls.

Thu Jan  7 21:24:43 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp
          1. The parse_args method accepts Event and Source Ids from
             the command line.
          2. The scheduler has an option of being local or remote.
             (specifying remote does not work very well yet).
          3. added methods init_SupplierQOS  and init_ConsumerQOS.

        created the CosEC_Multiple test, added all these files:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEvent_Multiple.h
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEvent_Multiple.cpp
          Base class for test consumer and supplier implementation.
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECConsumer.h
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECConsumer.cpp
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECSupplier.h
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECSupplier.cpp

        * orbsvcs/tests/README

Thu Jan  7 19:07:45 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_CATCHANY):  Don't treat the macro
          differently in either cases.  Simply reuse TAO_CATCH to catch
          CORBA_Exception.

Thu Jan 07 14:34:04 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_CATCHANY,TAO_CATCHALL): Changed
          TAO_CATCHANY to catch CORBA_Exception or its subclasses only.
          Another macro TAO_CATCHALL was added to facilitate the use of
          "catch (...)".  TAO_CATCHALL translates to a no-op on platforms
          without native exception support.

          This change is aim to unify the error handling behavior of TAO
          programs on platforms with or without native exceptions.  "catch
          (...)" is evil anyway.

        * tao/Connect.cpp (handle_input): Changed to use TAO_CATCHANY and
          TAO_CATCHALL.

Thu Jan 07 07:16:29 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.cpp (svc): initialize local
          "priority" to 0 to avoid warning about uninitialized use
          from DEC cxx with DCE threads.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp (shutdown): fixed
          if (_env.exception () == 0) test to be
          if (_env.exception () != 0).  Thanks to Russ Noseworthy
          <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for providing the fix.

Thu Jan 07 05:07:33 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.48 released.

Thu Jan 07 04:06:51 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Connect.cpp (check_unexpected_data): Made the checks for 0 and
          -1 from recv() the same. 0 is a graceful shutdown, while -1 is a
          somewhat ugly shutdown. Both will result in this function
          returning -1 and this connection getting closed.

        * Invocation.cpp (invoke): Added asserts to check for failures in
          resume_handler().

Wed Jan 06 16:44:06 1999  David L. Levine  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.47 released.

Wed Jan 06 16:16:40 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init_IR): added .in ()
          dereference to "time_service_server_".

Wed Jan  6 15:33:10 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * DynStruct_i.cpp:
          Even though this had already been fixed with respect to
          the latest compile problem, I noticed that the line in
          this file that contains ACE_Array_Base<> should be
          changed to something better that's already used in a
          couple of the other DynAny classes.

Wed Jan  6 15:29:10 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Commented out some IR related code for the build to go through.
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h (class Server_i):
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h:

Wed Jan 06 15:03:44 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/echo/Client_i.cpp (echo_list): added .in ()
          dereference to "ior".

Wed Jan 06 14:07:15 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp} (TAO_DONT_CATCH):
        * tao/try_macros.h: Reverted my previous change about not using
          catch (...) on TAO_CATCHANY for debug build.  This "feature" is
          turned on only when you define TAO_DONT_CATCH_DOT_DOT_DOT.
          Thanks to Irfan for persuading me.

Wed Jan  6 13:44:29 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h (class Server_i): Addded the
        IR related code.

Wed Jan 06 13:29:04 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynStruct_i.cpp: removed ACE_Array_Base<CORBA_DynAny_var>
          instantiation because it's in DynArray_i.cpp.

Wed Jan  6 14:05:21 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ch.cpp:

          g++ was issuing warnings for the helper methods defined for
          arrays (e.g., _alloc, _dup, _copy, _free). These warnings
          appeared only when the helper methods were in the outermost
          global scope because they were defined static and the compiler
          could not find their implementation. Thus, we now do not
          generate the "static" keyword for these helpers if they are in
          the outermost scope. However, this change made Sun C++ compiler
          unhappy since it did not like the _free and _alloc in the inline
          file (*.i) and their forward declarations did not have the
          inline word. So now also generate the ACE_INLINE macro for the
          _free and _alloc methods if they are in the outermost scope. Now
          both compilers are happy. Hopefully others are too.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_ci.cpp:
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_cs.cpp:

          The var and out implementation was not guarded by the #if
          !defined conditionla. As a result, there were instances when we
          could get multiple definitions. Thanks to Virginie Amar
          <vamar@amadeus.net> for submitting the bugreport.

          We had also forgotten to set the "is_generated" flag to true
          once we had generated code for the sequence node.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp:

          Since we now use the TAO_Object_Field_T<T> for object reference
          members of union, we couldn't call CORBA::release in the "reset"
          method. We now simply call "delete".

Wed Jan 06 11:55:25 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/echo/Client_i.cpp (echo_list): Changed <l> to of
          type Echo::List_var to free up the return value.  The returned
          string from object_to_string must be freed properly.

Wed Jan  6 09:31:16 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          The UDP_Receiver::init() method should only create the RT_Info
          if it is not there already. Thanks to Dave Meyer
          <dmeyer@std.saic.com> and J. Russell Noseworthy
          <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for providing this fix.

Wed Jan 06 09:04:46 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * docs/releasenotes/TODO.html:
          Updated the information about EC related tasks.

        * docs/releasenotes/ec.html:
          Added the new features in the EC; removed the entries about a
          missing CosEventChannel, because we have one now!

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Added some comments for Pradeep.

Wed Jan  6 07:44:24 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynStruct_i.cpp:
          Removed the last use (hopefully) of ACE_Array<>

Wed Jan 06 02:58:28 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_Examples.dsw

        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/On_Demand_Loading.dsw
        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/server.dsp

          - Changed the name of the Generic Servant dynamic library from
            MyFoo back to Generic_Servant.  This was causing too many
            things to break on NT since the original settings were based
            on the Generic_Servant name.

          - Removed excess include directories in the make setting.

          - Fixed NT make files (including release settings) and made them
            conform with the existing makefiles.

        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Activator.cpp
        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Locator.cpp
        * POA/Loader/Servant_Activator.cpp
        * POA/Loader/Servant_Locator.cpp
        * POA/Loader/Server_Manager.cpp

          - Removed access includes files.

        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Manager.cpp: Fixed use of ACE_CString.

Tue Jan  5 22:36:54 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}: We also need to define/declare static
          services for platform without svc.conf support.

Tue Jan  5 18:27:26 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init): Added the IR related
        code.

Tue Jan  5 17:44:53 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynAnyC.h
        * tao/DynAnyC.i
        * tao/DynSequence_i.h:
        * tao/DynStruct_i.h:
          Removed some other uses of ACE_Array in favor of ACE_Array_Base,
          in these cases there was no need for the operator== and/or
          operator!=

Tue Jan 05 15:40:20 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp (init_orb):
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Cubit_Task.cpp (initialize_orb):
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp (init):
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Server.cpp (init):
          Removed explicit call to <TAO_Internal::open_services> when
          building static lib version on Win32 since we can now use them
          as static service (and configure them thru svc.conf.static
          file.)

        * performance_tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf.static:
        * performance_tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static: Added two
          example svc.conf files to show how to use static services.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Changed the format of XXX_FACTORY_ARGS strings for
          platforms without svc.conf support to a single char string.
          These entries should look like this now:

           "static TAO_Foobar_Factory \"-ORBsettings a -ORBset b\""

        * tao/TAO_Internal.{h,cpp}: Removed method open_services which
          takes separate argument lists for each of the TAO default
          service.  Service initialization is now done in a more general
          way.

Tue Jan 05 14:32:11 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.i (_narrow): _narrow must increase the reference
          count on the object.  Thanks to Ron Barack <rab@terminal.cz> for
          reporting this bug.

Tue Jan 05 14:21:57 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (open_services): Added insertion of
          default static service objects of TAO.  I forgot to do that.

Tue Jan  5 13:06:12 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/Client_i.cpp (withdraw): Removed the
          cast and used the .in () method instead. This would probably
          fix the error on DU cxx.

Tue Jan 05 07:57:40 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/Client_i.cpp (withdraw): added in ()
          dereference of except->reason.  Thanks to Andy for figuring
          out how to get this to compile now.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp,client.cpp,
          MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp: removed VxWorks #ifdefs that disabled
          ORB shutdown, because it no longer causes a MemPartFree with
          last night's remove () fixes to ace/Synch.

Tue Jan 05 04:51:02 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/default_server.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}: Added definitions for static service
          objects and enabled TAO to use static services if
          TAO_USES_STATIC_SERVICE is defined.  This will allow platforms
          that doesn't support dynamic linking to change TAO's behavior at
          run-time.

Mon Jan 04 17:48:17 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.cpp (for_suppliers):
          Fixed typos.

Mon Jan  4 16:52:08 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the following project files for Time Service on NT.
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service.dsw
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service_Clerk.dsp
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service_Server.dsp

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Time_Service_Test.dsw
        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Time_Service_Test.dsp

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Client_i.cpp: Changed the TAO_CATCHANY to
          TAO_CATCH (SystemException, sysex). The former somehow wasn't
          catching CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT on NT.


Mon Jan  4 16:30:27 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/private_ch.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_access_cs.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_assign_cs.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
          Implemented TAO_Object_Field_T<foo> in place of foo_ptr
          for objects inside a union, so that _upcast() and
          _downcast() will work.

Mon Jan 04 16:08:49 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/Event_Channel_i.cpp (for_consumers):
          added missing ; at end of statement.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: with GreenHills gcx, added -w to CCFLAGS
          to suppress many warnings about TAO_YY_BREAK statements being
          unreachable.

Mon Jan  4 14:29:49 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_str_sequence_ci.cpp:

          For the [] operator, instead of returning a
          TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager, we were generating
          TAO_String_Manager.

        * tests/Param_Test/objref.cpp
          tests/Param_Test/ub_objref_seq.cpp:

          There were instances of incorrect assignment between a
          String_var and a TAO_String_Manager.

Mon Jan 04 12:45:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Runtime_Scheduler.{cpp, h}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Utilities.{h, i}: added
          ACE_NEW_THROW_RETURN, lots of comments.

Mon Jan 04 12:04:37 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/*
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
          Another code review for Pradeep.

Mon Jan  4 07:39:27 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.cpp:

          The code was written with the assumption that a string member of
          a struct gets mapped to CORBA::String_var. However, due to the
          recent changes made to the IDL compiler where a string member
          gets mapped to a TAO_String_Manager caused several problems in
          the Trader code. This happened when the string member was
          assigned directly to a CORBA::String_var class. The right way to
          do this is to use the "in ()" method on the TAO_String_Manager
          class to retrieve the underlying string.

        * tao/Managed_Types.h
          tao/ORB.h:

          I had forgotten to include the Managed_Types.i file when the
          ACE_INLINE macro is defined. This was causing all kinds of
          undefined symbol errors at link time. However, it turns out that
          the Managed_Types.i file uses operations such as
          CORBA::string_free that get used before their inline definition
          is seen in ORB.i. The solution to this dependency problem is to
          include Managed_Types.i after ORB.i in the file ORB.h.

        * tao/{Sequence, Sequence_T}.{i,cpp} (operator []):

          Moved the definition of the [] operator to the *.cpp file since
          it was using the inline constructor of the
          TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager before it was defined.

        * tao/Managed_Types.i:

          Some missing ACE_INLINE added.

Mon Jan 04 00:15:13 1999  Darrell Brunsch  <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/IR_Helper.cpp:
          Updated to work with recent changes to the ORB (specifically the
          IIOP_Object constructor and ORB_Core::addr()).

Sun Jan 03 23:05:08 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp:
        * tao/TAO.dsp:

          Added Managed_Types.cpp to build.

Sun Jan 03 22:42:22 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): moved "/2" out of
          the ACE_U64_TO_U32 conversion, because dividing an ACE_U_LongLong
          by an int results in an ACE_UINT32.

Sun Jan  3 22:01:37 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp:
          Used rebind () instead of bind (). Because servers dont handle ^C,
          once bound contexts stay bound till the Naming Service is up.
          This was already being done for clerks. Commented out the IR part.
          Fixed warnings in init() and run() methods.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h:
          Added some comments. Also commented out the IR part, so I could
          fix the warnings pointed out by David and check the files in.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp:
          Added some comments. Commented out the IR part. Removed warnings
          for unreferenced variables

Sun Jan 03 21:39:49 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp (encode_sequence_to_string): Removed extra call to
          isascii().  It's followed by an isprint(): if byte is printable,
          then it must be ascii.  Thanks to David Levine and Chris
          Cleeland for helping with this.

Sun Jan  3 21:10:42 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Addded a new function to check if it is the first server or clerk.
        If it is then get a new context and bind it to the Name Server.
        The subsequent servers and clerks will bind to this context. The
        way this was being done previously is by clearing the exception
        and checking the return value of NamingContext::resolve (). Was
        working fine on Solaris but threw an exception on NT. I am now
        handling the exception appropriately. Also corrected a memory
        problem using CORBA::string_dup.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.h:

Sun Jan  3 20:30:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: added TAO Scheduling Service section

Sun Jan  3 19:22:23 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.h:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/README:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/Makefile:
          added the above files for the COS Event Service.

Sun Jan  3 18:56:51 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynSequence_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynStruct_i.{h<cpp}:
          Changed use of ACE_Array to use of ACE_Array_Base,
          to match Carlos' changes to DynArray_i.

Sun Jan  3 18:54:29  1999  Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/On_Demand_Loading.dsw:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/"POA On_Demand_Loading Server.dsp":
          Added the NT workspace for the On_Demand_Loading example.

        * examples/POA/Loader/Loader.dsp:
        * examples/POA/Loader/"POA Loader Server.dsp":
          Added the NT workspace for the Loader example.

        * examples/POA/Generic_Servant/Server.dsp:
          Changed the settings of the project so that MyFoo.dll is produced as output.

Sun Jan  3 19:27:01 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * tao/Managed_Types.{h,i,cpp}:

          Three new files added. These define and implement the various
          manager classes such as TAO_String_Manager,
          TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager that are required by the IDL to C++
          mapping for struct members that are strings and sequences of
          strings, respectively. We had to resort to two different
          managers because the managed type for sequence of strings must
          obey the value of the release data member of the sequence
          class. Other than this, the semantics are the same.

        * tao/ORB.h:

          Included the newly added Managed_Types.h file.

        * tao/{Sequence, Sequence_T}.{h,i,cpp}:

          Moved the TAO_String_Manager to the Managed_Types.* files. In
          addition, we now use TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager for the return
          type of the [] operator.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array.cpp (visit_string):

          Arrays of strings now use the TAO_String_Manager as its element
          type instead of CORBA::String_var. This was required to conform
          to the IDL->C++ mapping.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/field_ch.cpp (visit_string):

          Struct memebrs that are strings now use the TAO_String_Manager
          as its type instead of CORBA::String_var. This was required to conform
          to the IDL->C++ mapping.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/elemtype.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_str_sequence_ch.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_str_sequence_ci.cpp

          The generated code now produces TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager
          instead of TAO_String_Manager for the [] operator.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

          Updated to reflect latest status. Also, removed some old
          comments that are no longer applicable.

Sun Jan  3 17:32:27 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Vistors.cpp:
          Added some casting to fix some conversion warnings I was
          getting while rebuilding with VC5.

Sun Jan  3 13:12:27 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the TAO_ORBSVCS_Export macro to the following files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Server.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_TIO.h

Sat Jan  2 17:32:35 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.cpp:
          split the <init> method over 3 other  methods -
          <init_ORB>, <init_RtEC> and <init_CosEC>.

Sat Jan 02 11:15:48 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.cpp (obtain_push_supplier):
          added .in () dereference to rtecproxypushsupplier.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.cpp (obtain_push_consumer):
          added .in () dereference to rtecproxypushconsumer.

        * examples/Simple/grid/Client_i.cpp (test_grid): added
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG (ret_val) to avoid compiler warning with ACE_NDEBUG.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp (get_first_IOR): added
          .in () dereference to obj.

Fri Jan  1 23:31:48 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.cpp:
          corrections to comments after code review.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.cpp:
          using ACE_NEW now.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.cpp:
          using ACE_NEW now.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.cpp:
          uses ACE_NEW now, added a <connected> method,
          connect_push_consumer method throws AlreadyConnected and
          BAD_PARAM exceptions.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp:
          uses ACE_NEW now.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.h:
          changed method names to init,run and shutdown.
          corrections to comments after code review.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.cpp:
          added checks for return errors.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECSupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECSupplier.cpp:
          corrections to comments after code review.
          <disconnect_push_supplier> method now deactivates
          the Supplier object.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer.cpp:
          corrections to comments after code review.
          <disconnect_push_consumer> method now deactivates
          the Comsumer object.

Fri Jan  1 18:11:07 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp : Used _duplicate ()
        on the server IORs. This overcomes the automatic deletion of memory.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp : Used the advance () method
        to iterate over the ACE_Array. The ACE_Unbounded_Set which was being
        used earlier did not require this method to be used.

Fri Jan 01 16:48:23 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): replaced cast
          with ACE_U64_TO_U32 macro invocation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp: added
          ACE_Array_Base<TAO_EC_Event> explicit instantiation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Visitors.cpp: added
          a bunch of TAO_find explicit instantiations.

Fri Jan  1 13:33:33 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp: Removed a ; at the end of a
          function. Digital Unix 4.0 was throwing a warning for this.

Fri Jan  1 12:29:28 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Added the Time_Service directory.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp:
          Use ACE_Array_Base instead of ACE_Unbounded_Set because it does
          not require an == or != operator defined.

        * tao/DynArray_i.h:
        * tao/DynArray_i.cpp:
          Use ACE_Array_Base instead of ACE_Array.

Fri Jan  1 11:51:42 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Removed some VxWorks errors like 'TAO_TRY_LABEL unreferenced' in
        the following files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_TIO.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time//TAO_UTO.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time//TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp:

Fri Jan 01 02:45:18 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ci.cpp (gen_forany_impl and
          gen_var_impl): There is no cast required for assigning a pointer
          to zero. Thanks to Patrice Bensoussan <pbensoussan@amadeus.net>
          for reporting this bug.

        * Active_Object_Map.i: Rearranged functions to remove "redeclared
          inline after being called" warnings.  Thanks to David for
          pointing these out.
