Tue Mar  9 15:50:42 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

	* orbsvcs/examples/FaultTolerance/RolyPoly/ORB_Initializer.cpp:
	  Fixed usage of wrong variable.

Tue Mar  9 11:39:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

	* tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Smart_Proxy_Impl.h:
	  Changed export macro to use, this fixes a link error with VC71

Mon Mar  8 21:47:39 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Acceptor_Impl.cpp: An application that linked against TAO
	  crashed inside TAO (dangling pointer access) if the default ACE
 	  reactor is deleted before the orb is deactivated.  Fixed this by
 	  making sure the ORB uses the same reactor as the
 	  ACE_Accept_Strategy.  Thanks to Peter Hercek <peter@syncad.com>
 	  for this fix.

Mon Mar  8 13:53:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* NEWS:

	  Added a NEWS file which tracks user visible changes between
	  every beta. Thanks to Olli Savia and Gary Duzan for motivating
	  this.

Sun Mar  7 17:47:16 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

	* TAO-INSTALL.html
	  Moved LynxOS to "partially supported" category.
	  Fixed some HTML errors.

Sat Mar  6 09:09:45 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tao/Thread_Per_Connection_Handler.cpp:

	  Fixed a warning in g++ builds.

Fri Mar  5 23:31:34 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tao/Acceptor_Impl.cpp:
	* tao/Thread_Per_Connection_Handler.cpp:
	* tao/Thread_Per_Connection_Handler.h:

	  Reverted the change from "Fri Mar  5 15:56:08 2004  Balachandran
	  Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>", and used the argument
	  inherit_priority to do the same thing.

Fri Mar  5 16:32:15 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

 	* orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Makefile:
	* orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/Makefile:

	  Linked in the TAO_Messaging library, since the Naming service
	  depends on the messaging library. This should fix link errors
	  with static builds in our scoreboard.

Fri Mar  5 15:56:08 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tao/Thread_Per_Connection_Handler.cpp:
	* tao/Thread_Per_Connection_Handler.h:

	  Added a new method activate_threads (). This method gets the
	  priority of the invoking thread and transfers it to the thread
	  that it is about to create. This feature was broken before,
	  ie. TAO never honored the priority of the invoking thread at
	  all.

	* tao/Acceptor_Impl.cpp:

	  Use activate_threads () instead of activate ().

	  These changes were due to a bug report submitted by Abhi
	  <abhi@qualcomm.com> and thanks to him for reporting the
	  problem and also providing patches that were useful for this
	  fix.

Fri Mar  5 18:36:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

	* orbsvcs/performance-tests/LoadBalancing/client.cpp:
	  Fixed unused variable warning

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Test_Filter/Test_Filter.mpc:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/lib/Notify_lib.mpc:

          Switch to using the notification base project instead of notify.
          The notify base project only inherited from notification and
          provided nothing else.

        * utils/NamingViewer/NamingViewer.mpc:

          Fixed this mpc file.  It previously produced a project file for a
          dynamic library that wouldn't compile anyway.

Thu Mar  4 17:24:49 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Any_Impl.cpp (_remove_ref ()):

          Scope the lock before calling delete.

        * tao/Any_Unknown_IDL_Type.cpp:

          Use delete to remove the message block. We used new to create
          it.

Thu Mar  4 16:48:20 2004  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/run_test.pl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/run_test.pl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Pluggable/run_test.pl:

          Forced the user to specify the 'RTP/UDP' protocol string as
          'RTP_UDP' at the command line. This was required to fix the
          run-time error caused when executing the auto_run_tests.pl. This
          script was mis-interpreting the '/' in RTP/UDP as a dir
          delimiter. This should fix the run-time errors on all the
          builds.

Thu Mar 04 09:45:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAOACE.dsw:

          Added dependencies for ACEXML and ACEXML parser.

          I did manage to locate Thomas Lockhart's bug report listing out
          many of the above files. Thanks to him for identifying the
          problem.

Wed Mar  3 13:32:52 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Properties_Encoder.inl:

Wed Mar  3 10:55:13 2004  David Smith  <dts@prismtechnologies.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/IFR_Service_Utils_T.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/receiver.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/receiver.cpp:

          Added the Receiver_Callback::handle_destroy method to shutdown
          the receiver when the stream was destroyed.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/sender.cpp:

          Set the QoS Params in Sender::fill_qos to Diffserv_Codepoint if
          rapi=0. Else the QoS Params are set to the intserv values. This
          ensures that when rapi=0 and the modify_qos method is called
          then the diffserv codepoint is set for all the frames sent..

          Added the graceful shutdown of the process when all frames were
          sent.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/README:

          Modified to include details of diffserv testing.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS/runtest.pl:

          Modified to specify transport protocols and debug levels from
          the command line.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Makefile:

          Added the compilation of Simple_Two_Stage_With_QoS test.

Tue Mar  2 13:12:43 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp (drain_queue_helper):

          Check for EAGAIN in addition to EWOULDBLOCK. POSIX conformant
          implementations can use either EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN. Thanks to
          Kris Dekeyser <Kris.Dekeyser@lms.be> for pointing this out.

Tue Mar  2 07:43:07 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Properties_Encoder.inl:

          <Kris.Dekeyser@lms.be> for pointing  this out.

Tue Mar  2 09:05:48 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Any.cpp:

          Added specialization of TAO::Any_Impl_T<>::to_object for
          CORBA::Object. Otherwise the default template implementation
          is used, which always returns (boolean) 0 and does nothing.
          Thanks to Irfan Pyarali <irfan@oomworks.com> for reporting
          the problem.

Mon Mar  1 12:31:38 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Properties_Encoder.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Properties_Encoder.cpp:
          ACE_Pair cannot contain CORBA::Any due to missing operator
          != on Any (and fool compilers that expand unused template
          methods (LynxOs; gcc version 2.9-gnupro-98r2))
          Hand-code a simple pair to replace ACE_Pair in this case.

Sun Feb 29 22:10:00 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Environment.i (release ()):

          Removed an unneeded check for null pointer. Thanks to Gabriele
          Trombetti<gabtromb@isis.vanderbilt.edu> for pointing this out.

Sun Feb 29 20:00:02 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ObjectKey_Table.cpp:

          The TAO::ObjectKey_Table uses ACE_RB_Tree as the container of
          the object  keys for TAO. RB_Tree uses ordering functor
          TAO::Less_Than_ObjectKey. However, the functor was not strictly
          ordered. Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic <milan.cvetkovic@mpathix.com>
          for finding this problem. The bad ordering lead to some of the
          object keys being left in the tree which caused huge growth in
          runtime memory.

          Another set of changes to ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS check. This should
          get these tests compiling almost on all the platforms. Don't be
          surprised if you see link errors in our daily builds. They were
          there in the tests, for god knows how long. These set of changes
          should get them compiling and throw up errors in our daily
          builds.

Sun Feb 29 17:52:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsem@remedy.nl>

          All these Makefiles were busted. They don't build in our daily

          place. I remember Thomas Lockhart mentioning about some of these
          things. I think he had caught all of this already.

Fri Feb 27 16:28:51 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/Alt_Resources/Resource_Factory.cpp (allocate_reactor_impl):

          Set errno to zero before creating the Reactor.  Otherwise, the
          code in TAO_Default_Resource_Factory::get_reactor() improperly
          think there was a failure in creating the Reactor.

          Removed checking for duplicate service context id explicitly while adding

          execution path.

Thu Feb 26 10:10:40 MST 2004  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * tao/ClientRequestInfo.cpp:
        * tao/ClientRequestInfo.h:
          Added accessor to the invocation object.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
          Added set_default and not_default methods for specifying which
          orb should be the default and specifying which orb should not be
          the default.  (Passes calls to the ORB_Table)

        * tao/ORB_Table.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Table.h:
          Added set_default and not_default methods for specifying which
          orb should be the default (first orb in the table) and specifying
          which orb should not be the default.
          Changed the bind method to set the new ORB as the default (first in
          the table) if the current default ORB does not want to be default.
          Added accessor methods for the TAO_ORBCore and the underlying table.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.h:
          Added variables for keeping track of the size of the current received
          buffer and number of bytes sent for the send call.
          Added accessors to these tracking variables.


          These are changes for working with the OVATION distributed
          debugger.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/cdr_op_ci.cpp:

          When marshaling an interface member, changed generation to
          use CORBA::Object::marshal(), which checks for a nil
          object reference, instead of calling the virtual marshal()
          method directly. This fix is similar to what is already
          done for struct and exception members. Thanks to
          Hans Bos <hans.bos@xelion.nl> for reporting the bug.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp:

          Set the return token value to 0 if, when parsing a union
          branch, we find that it is an illegal recursive type.
          This prevents a crash on subsequent processing. Thanks to
          Hans Bos <hans.bos@xelion.nl> for reporting the bug.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/sender.cpp:

          Removed the debug level check for printing frames sent message.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/receiver.cpp:

          Removed the debug level check for printing frames received

Tue Feb 24 19:41:01 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/Sequence_Latency/DSI/DSI.mpc:
          Removed after and IDL_Files from client project, just let MPC do its
          job.

        * performance-tests/Sequence_Latency/AMH/Single_Threaded/Single_Threaded.mpc:
          Removed after and IDL_Files from client project, just let MPC do its
          job. Instead of requiring ami and adding idlflags, just add amh as base
          project.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RTCosScheduling/RTCosScheduling_ServerScheduler_i.h:
          Removed useless forward declaration which caused a warning in the
          VC71 build.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.h:
          Made the assignment operator private and added a private copy
          constructor. A TAO_PropertySet cannot be copied and this fixes
          link errors in the VC71 build.

Tue Feb 24 19:15:19 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/Sequence_Latency/Single_Threaded/Single_Threaded.mpc:
          Removed empty IDL_Files and after from the client project. Let MPC
          just do its job and then it works without problems. Because of this
          we had a build order dependency between client and server and this
          caused problems in our static builds. Thanks to Chad Elliott with
          helping solve this.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/FtEventServiceInterceptor.cpp:
          Changed the processing of service contexts from receive_request_service_contexts()
          to receive_request(), this allows to filter out the requests which do not need the
          burden of service contexts processing.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/FtEventServiceInterceptor.cpp:
          Changed to use FTRTEC specific message log facility instead of ACE_DEBUG.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/Utils/Log.h:
          Removed used macros.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/Utils/FTEC_Gateway.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/Utils/FTEC_Gateway.cpp:
          Changed to use another ORB for gateway objects in order to bypass the
          interceptor processing in the collocated case.

Mon Feb 23 10:59:03 2004  Huang-Ming Huang  <hh1@cse.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/FtEventServiceInterceptor.cpp:

          Fixed auto_ptr.reset() problem in VC6 build.

Sat Feb 21 09:36:45 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Codeset_Manager.cpp (TAO_Codeset_Item): Replaced
          delete [] this->name_ with ACE_OS::free (this->name_) since
          this->name_ was allocated by ACE_OS::strdup().  Thanks to
          Olivier Brunet <o.brunet@free.fr> for reporting this.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_10.cpp (write_request_header):

          Added code to add the username as principal in the request
          header.  This is required for some older ORBs, such as Orbix3.
          To turn on this code, TAO_PEER_REQUIRES_PRINCIPAL must be
          defined at compile time.  This fixes bug 1686.

Thu Feb 19 18:55:13 2004  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp (protocol_object_set):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp (is_protocol_object_set):

          Added the above methods in order to set/get a flag that shows if
          the protocol_object is set and hence if the mmdevices are bound
          successfully.

          The problem of the ACE_Acceptor::handle_input () not being
          called manifested when running the AVStreams tests on a single
          host (for eg. daily builds). The problem on a single host (and
          which could manifest itself sometimes in a multiple host
          scenario too) was due to the sequence in which the various
          requests to the sender arrived and were processed. There are two
          kinds of send and receive that go on. One is the GIOP requests
          and the other the out of band AVStreams connection setup
          requests. When a two-way bind_devs call is made by the sender
          the AVStreams initiates the setup of the out-of-band data path
          by creating an acceptor and listening for a connect request on
          the sender. It also initiates a connect on the receiver. When
          the connect call is made by the receiver the sender OS accepts
          the connection though it does not process the accept at the
          application level. Before it can process the connect request it
          receives a reply to the bind_devs as the receiver assumes it is
          connected to the sender. The bind_devs reply is processed before
          the connect request is processed at the application
          level. Hence, the application continues to execute and there is
          no thread to accept the connect request. So the
          ACE_Acceptor::handle_input does not get called and subsequently
          the protocol_object on which data is sent is also not
          created. Immediately after the bind_devs the sender::pace_data
          is called which tries to send the frames on a null
          protocol_object and results in a seg fault. This was fixed by
          checking for the protocol object set flag in the
          TAO_Base_StreamEndPoint::handle_postconnect method. If the flag
          is not set then the application gives the reactor a chance to
          process the pending requests which could be the expected connect
          request.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/SCTP_SEQ.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/RTP.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/TCP.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/UDP.cpp:

          Set the protocol object set flag when the protocol object is created.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Transport.cpp (close_all):

          Fixed an incorrect deletion of connector objects in the
          Connector Registry.

          The above fixes should fix the various scoreboard build errors
          in AVStreams tests and also fix problems with SCTP_SEQ pluggable
          transport.

          Pass the thread manager used in the ORB_Core to the

          The address explicitly specified by the application was
          incorrectly passed as 0.0.0.0 to the acceptor. This was due to
          an erroneous setting of the address within the

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_ci.cpp:

          Added a check to replace a call to the virtual marshal()
          method with the underlying CDR stream operator, for
          abstract interface members of an aggregate type. The
          virtual method is to catch attempts to marshal local
          interfaces. However, abstract interfaces cannot be local,
          and they have the wrong base class for the virtual method's
          signature anyway. Thanks to Jiang Wei <sdjiangwei@sina.com>
          for reporting the problem. This fix closes [BUGID:1742].

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SECIOP.idl:

          Removed this unused file to avoid potential confusion.  It is a
          vestige of early TAO CORBA security service CVS commits.  The
          plan was to implement SECIOP very soon after the introduction of
          this file.  Due to time and resource constraints, and lack of
          funding, the SECIOP protocol was never implemented.  Thanks to
          Brian R. Mendel for pointing out this problem.

Thu Feb 12 15:41:42 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/buffer_type.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_sequence/buffer_type.h:

          To class be_visitor_sequence_buffer_type, added the following
          missing method overrides:

          visit_component()
          visit_component_fwd()
          visit_eventtype()
          visit_eventtype_fwd()

          which enables generation of the sequence buffer type name for
          sequences of components and eventtypes. Thanks to Patrick
          Lardieri <plardier@atl.lmco.com> for pointing out the missing
          code generation.

          Changed the implementation of insertion and extraction operators
          for unbounded (w)strings to be identical to those for the
          bounded versions, only with the bound set to 0. This eliminates
          bogus failures when (w)strings are inserted as bounded and
          extracted as unbounded, or vice versa. Thanks to
          David Kinder <david.kinder@sophos.com> for pointing out
          the problem.

Thu Feb 12 13:10:56 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          Added code to make sure that all arguments and return types
          added as a result of implied IDL have their full scoped
          names initialized, so that their flat names can be computed
          correctly later, if need be.

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL_Test.mpc:

          Added -GC (AMI), -GH (AMH) and -Gd (direct collocation) to
          the IDL compiler command line options, so that code
          generated as a result of these options can be tested on
          all platforms.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_arg_traits.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation/operation.h:

          - Fixed IDL compiler crash when anonymous bounded (w)strings
            are used as operation parameters or return types, which,
            unlike with anonymous sequences and arrays, is legal IDL.
            Thanks to James Kanyok <james.kanyok@lmco.com> for
            reporting the problem. Any number of such parameters and/or
            return types, with identical bounds, may occur in the same
            or multiple scopes, leading to the Arg_Traits<> specialization
            problem addressed below. This closes [BUGID:1739].

          - Added a mechanism to generate unique type names for template
            parameters in the specializations of Arg_Traits<>
            corresponding to operation parameter and return types
            described above. For operation parameters, the parameter
            identifier's flat name is used, for return types, the
            operation's flat name is used, to declare an empty C++
            struct, whose type then becomes the Arg_Traits<> specialization
            template parameter.

        * tests/IDL_Test/anonymous.idl:

          Added IDL to test the code generation for the above use cases,
          furthere stressing the IDL compiler by making the common
          string bound a typedef'd constant.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventTypeSeq.cpp (init):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Admin.cpp (subscribed_types):

          Corrected the implementation to add the caller's <subscribed_types> to
          the Admin Object's types. This solves the problem that if a
          proxy's connect_structured_push_consumer() is called *AFTER*
          the proxy's subscription_change(), then the subscriptions do not work.
          Thanks to Richard G. Hash <richard.hash@openspirit.com> fpr
          reporting this problem.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/CosNotify_Service.cpp:
        * docs/releasenotes/notify.html:

          Added the -NoUpdates option to the Notification svc.conf
          options. e.g. static TAO_CosNotify_Service " -ListenerThreads 1 -NoUpdates"
          If this option is specified, the subscription_change/offer_change messages are NOT sent to proxy
          objects.
          This option is useful to turn off entire updates for applications
          that do not reply on subscription_change/offer_change messages.
          Thanks to Richard G. Hash <richard.hash@openspirit.com> for
          motivating this option.

          Note that updates can be turned off on an individual proxy by calling:
          on a ProxyConsumer -
          CosNotification::EventTypeSeq obtain_subscription_types(
                                      in ObtainInfoMode mode );
          and on a ProxySupplier -
          CosNotification::EventTypeSeq obtain_offered_types(
                                      in ObtainInfoMode mode );

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/CosNotify_Service.cpp:
          The "-ListenerThreads " option was being applied to the
          ProxyConsumer instead of the ProxySupplier.Thanks to Karl
          Tredwell<KTredwell@tullib.com> for reporting this problem and
          providing the fix.

Wed Feb 11 10:22:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ec_typed_events.mpb:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/ami_exception_holder_ch.cpp:

          Added unindent macro insertion to the output stream after
          visiting each raise_* operation in the generated internal
          class _tao_*_ExceptionHolder, to keep the indentation from
          growing with each operation. Also added a comment to the
          instantiation of the operation visitor, justifying the use of
          the one for the generated implementation classes.

          source file/line#) info to implementation files, and added checks
          to the appropriate visitors so that this debug info generation
          is off by default.

        * docs/compiler.html:

          Added documentation for the new command line option above.

Mon Feb  9 16:03:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FTORB.mpc:
          Reordered files cpp files to fix compile errors in our SuSE 9 MPC

Mon Feb  9 08:36:12 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (connection_timeout):

          Fixed a weird bug that caused the has_timeout to be irrespective
          of what the messaging library says. Thanks to Torsten Kupper for
          pointing this out.

Sun Feb  8 15:34:52 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp (IDL_GlobalData): Added enough

Sun Feb  8 10:28:30 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Makefile*:

          Updated dependencies.

        * tao/Invocation_Adapter.h:

          Overhauled the memory management of the reply dispatcher. Used a
          Auto_Functor to manage memory through the life-time of the
          objects. This should prevent the leaks that Andrew
          Reid<andrew.reid@eservglobal.com> reported.

        * tao/Makefile*: Updated dependencies using the new dependency
          generator.

Sat Feb  7 22:09:50 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile*:

          Updated dependencies. A new script $ACE_ROOT/bin/depgen.pl was
          used to generate dependencies. The following command was used to
          use the above script "make DEPGEN=$ACE_ROOT/bin/depgen.pl
          depend".  If the script works well we can make this the
          default.

          BTW, this should fix some strange errors in the daily builds.

          of the servant classes. Thanks to Don Hinton for pointing this
          out.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:

          Fix for BUGID 1734. Please see

Fri Feb  6 18:56:21 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp (svc_i):

          A mistake while we kept looping trying to read messages. The
          loop used the availability of the transport () as a
          condition to exit the loop. But in the world after BUG 1020 was
          fixed, this condition is not right. The lifetime of the
          transport and the lifetime of the connection handler was tied
          together. The transport will never get deleted till the
          connection handler is deleted. The connection handler will never
          get deleted since the thread is using it. This is a vicious
          loop. Therefore we have removed that condition. We have added
          another condition to check for exiting out of the loop. The new
          condition basically checks the status of read () call. If the
          read call fails (we have taken care of timeouts here), we exit
          out of the loop.

        * tao/Thread_Per_Connection_Handler.cpp:

          Before we call remove_ref () on the transport, just make sure
          to call close_connection () on the connection handler. Reactive
          servers do that automatically through a call from the
          reactor.

          These fixes should take care of the leak problems that Chris
          Reed <cr@apama.com> reported. Thanks to Chris for reporting
          this.

Fri Feb  6 22:55:30 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * tao/CORBALOC_Parser.cpp: Remove TAO_HAS_SCIOP.
          It is reasonable for the corbaloc parser to fail
          if a user specifies an sciop URL but did not compile
          SCTP support into ACE.

Fri Feb  6 16:40:06 2004  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTKokyuEvent: Added a LIBCHECK for
          Kokyu library. If Kokyu library is not built, it shows warning
          message to build the Kokyu library rather than stopping the
          build process.

          tries starting up a CORBA server on TCP port 0.

        * tests/Makefile:

          The shutdown () on the ORB is invoked with a value of 1.

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Added a new variable, VTAO_IDLFLAGS, and assign $(TAO_IDLFLAGS)
          to it.  Then use VTAO_IDLFLAGS when invoking the TAO_IDL
          compiler.  This is needed to avoid a problem where users
          "override" TAO_IDLFLAGS in their own makefiles.  Once you
          override a variable, all subsequent assignments must use
          "override" too, or they are ignored.  Many Makefile throughout
          TAO make assignments to TAO_IDLFLAGS, as well as many users, so
          adding "override" has the potential of breaking lots of code.
          This change is needed so that -I$(TAO_ROOT) to TAO_IDLFLAGS
          without breaking user makefiles that override it.

                  per the above changes.

                - Added missing ACE_ROOT/ace includes.

                - Made other modifications as necessary to MPC files to
                  eliminate build errors.

Thu Jan 29 11:57:49 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:

          For abstract interfaces, in the body of the generated
          *_setup_collocation() method, added a check for non-zero
          collocation factory function pointer to the existing
          check for a non-zero 'collocated' argument. As the generated
          code stands right now, this argument will always be 0 for
          abstract interfaces, but the extra check was added as a
          "belt-and-suspenders" level of safety in case the
          generated code logic changes in the future.

Thu Jan 29 11:23:50 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (gen_stub_src_includes):

          Moved the conditional code generation for abstract interface
          related filed outside the scope of the check for non-local
          operations. While it is very likely that an abstract interface
          declaration will contain at least one operation, it is not
          required by IDL. Thanks to Yavannadil <yavannadil@yahoo.com>
          for reporting the problem.

Thu Jan 29 09:36:11 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/orb.idl:

          Added 'tao/' prefix to each included .pidl file, since some builds
          (even some versions of a build on certain platforms) have only
          TAO_ROOT in the path and not also TAO_ROOT/tao.

        * TAO_IDLinclude/idl_global.h:
        * TAO_IDLutil/utl_global.cpp:

          The IDL compiler generates the includes *C.h and *S.h for
          every corresponding IDL file included in the main IDL file,
          except for one - orb.idl, since it has no associated
          generated code. However, it does include several .pidl
          files, and if orb.idl is included to allow references
          to the contents of one or more of these .pidl files,
          their corresponding C++ header files should be
          included in generated code. These changes create a
          mechanism to read orb.idl, if it is seen, and add its
          included .pidl files to the IDL compiler's included IDL
          file list, which causes the corresponding C++ header
          file includes to be generated automatically. Thanks to
          Scott Gammill <zumo@flashmail.com> for reporting the
          problem and for sending in an exmaple IDL file.

        * tao/StringSeqS.h:

          New file, containing no declarations, added to eliminate
          compile errors stemming from the above changes, since
          orb.idl includes StringSeq.pidl.

        * tao/tao.mpc:

          Added the above new file, and all the other *S.h files
          (added for a similar purpose) in TAO to the MPC file,
          so they will appear in VC projects for convenient
          inspection and editing.

          Eliminated generation of the *A.h file, containing
          declarations for Any operators and triggered by the
          option -GA. Moved generation of Any operator declarations
          back to the *C.h file. Left generation of the *A.cpp file
          unchanged, except for removal of *A.h #include. This
          change allows us to avoid linking *A.cpp in
          DLLs if the Any operators are not used, while still
          allowing their declarations to be found if they are referenced
          in another generated file.

        * tao/OctetSeqA.h:

          Moved the declaration of Any operators and type code from
          OctetSeqA.h to OctetSeqC.h, so the operators can be seen
          in generated code if CORBA::OctetSeq is used there. Thanks

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/ami_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation.cpp:

          In generated operation stub code, changed the name of the
          array of argument helper classes passed to Invocation_Adapter,
          so that the array name does not begin with the characters
          '_tao_'. These characters are coincidentally applied as a prefix
          to each argument helper class identifier, and so there was a
          possibility of a name clash. Of course there is still a
          chance of a name clash with the argument identifier itself,
          but there is no way to eliminate that, only to minimize it.
          This fix closes [BUGID:1725]. Thanks to Mouna Seri
          <seri@crhc.uiuc.edu> for reporting the bug and for sending
          the example IDL file that illustrated it.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/Repository_i.h:

          - Changed the servant creation code to create the most
            derived servant classes for abstract, local, and
            unconstrained interfaces. These more derived classes
            inherit from the mixin class TAO_InterfaceAttrExtension_i,
            making the method create_ext_attribute() (which creates
            IFR entries for the CORBA 3 attribute that can have
            exceptions) visible. This change eliminates a BAD_OPERATION
            exception that was thrown when trying to create an
            attribute entry in the IFR. Thanks to Cristian Ferretti
            <cristian_ferretti@yahoo.com> for reporting the bug and
            supplying an example IDL file.

          - Changed the POA and servant selector functions to return
            the more derived servants (or associated POAs) described above.

          - Changed the includes file concrete_classes.h accordingly.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_decl.cpp:

          Changed the mutator of the member that stores the version
          to update the repository id along with a legal set of
          the version. Since the repository id is now computed
          eagerly, it must be updated if a #pragma version directive
          is encountered in the IDL file. Thanks to Nils Sandoy
          <nils.sandoy@fast.no> for sending in the example IDL file
          that uncovered the problem.

          Added generation of an empty struct for each array,
          anonymous or not, in an IDL file. This struct is then
          used as a tag in the parameter list for the various
          template classes associated with arrays - _var, _out,
          _forany, Array_Traits<> and bounded/unbounded array
          sequences. This added tag disambiguates the types of
          the above classes for any two arrays in a build, even
          if they have the same element type and bound. Thanks

          that option has been changed to "-l".

          Note: IFR_Service was changed to not support multicast discovery
          as part of a large change:

          Wed Mar 12 09:49:00 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          after the 1.3.1 release by changing the default value of
          the use_multicast_server parameter of

          Fixed test scripts so they would find tao_ifr.exe in
          %ACE_ROOT%/bin or %TAO_ROOT%/orbsvcs/IFR_Service since the
          *.DSPs in the repository put it in one place and the *.DSPs
          generated by MPC put it in another. This technique also works on
          Unix builds.

          still work.

        * orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo/IFR_Test/README:
        * orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo/Persistence_Test/README:
          Updated tests and test documentation to work with IFR_Service

          whether it is a struct, union, or exception member) is
          inappripriate in such a case.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_extern.h:
        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_recursive.cpp:

          Beefed up the checked for illegal recursion to include the
          following category:

          interface foo
          {
            struct bar
            {
                          foo foo_mem;
                        };
                  };

                  and similar cases with the recursion nested at deeper levels.
                  Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> for sending
                  in the example IDL.

                * tests/IDL_Test/interface.idl:

                  Added the above example to the test file.

        * examples/Borland/ChatClient.bpr:
          Don't use -O2, this causes problems with BCB6 in a release build,
          use -Og -Ov -OS as seperate options. This not sets -Oi which is
          the problem.

        * examples/Advanced/ch_8_and_10/server.h:
          Reverted my change of Fri Jan 16 14:16:49 UTC 2004. The problem
          is the optimizer of BCB6 and replacing strcpy with ::strcpy is
          not a nice solution

Tue Jan 20 11:03:58 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Advanced/ch_8_and_10/client.cpp:

          Use different variable names within for loops to avoid build
          problems with the very out-dated Visual C++ 6.0.

        * examples/Advanced/ch_8_and_10/icp.cpp:

          Use std::min instead of min to avoid build problems with Visual

        * tao/StringSeqA.h:
        * tao/StringSeqC.h:

          Move declaration of Any operators from *A.h file to *C.h file.
          This move will enable the compiler to find the Any operators
          if the (w)string sequence is used as an operation parameter
          (in which case interceptors require the Any insertion operator).
          In the future, subsetting of interceptors will eliminate this
          problem.

        * tao/tao.mpc:

          Added StringSeqA.cpp to the source file list.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_union.h:

          Expanded the IDL compiler's code that checks for recursive types,
          to handle recursion that is deeply nested, occurring multiple
          times, occurring at multiple levels, or some combination of
          these. The IDL appearing at the end of the Deployment and
          Configuration specification (ptc/03-07-02), taken as a whole,
          contains all of these use cases.

        * tests/IDL_Test/sequence.idl:

          Added a pared-down version of the D and C spec IDL mentioned
          above to this test, but a version that contains all the recursive
          type use cases of the original.

Fri Jan 16 11:27:28 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:

          Modified the -g <gperf path> command line option to
          automatically append "/gperf.exe" if we are on
          Windows. CreateProcess (called under the hood when the gperf
          process is spawned) apparently needs it this way. Thanks to Brad
          Orner <bradley_p_orner@raytheon.com> for reporting the problem
          and Brian Mendel <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com> for providing the

Fri Jan 16 15:34:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orsbvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Service.{h,cpp}:
          Parse the notify service arguments before initialising the ORB so
          that the -ORBRunThreads option is consumed before we let the ORB
          parse the arguments, because else the ORB will throw an exception
          about a unknown -ORB option. The argc argument of the parse_args
          function is now by reference, so that it is updated because this
          method consumes the arguments. Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi>
          for reporting this and also testing the changes.

        * examples/Advanced/ch_8_and_10/icp.cpp:
          Also msvc doesn't have lrand48

        * examples/Advanced/ch_8_and_10/server.h:
          Use ::strcmp instead of strcmp. Because of the subsetting just using
          strcmp directly gives compile problems with Borland. This fixes
          the problems with Borland and it didn't break the environments I have
          access to. If other environments break, the solution would be to use
          ACE_OS::strcmp but these examples doesn't use anything of ACE_OS
          at this moment.

Fri Jan 16 14:10:09 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Advanced/ch_8_and_10/server.cpp:
          Moved function call outside assert. This fixes a warning in the

          build.

        * tao/Exception.cpp:
        * tao/Exception.h:

          - Added ostream insertion operator for CORBA::Exception*,
            which is required by the spec along with the existing
            ostream insertion operator for CORBA::Exception&.

          - Moved the above operators into the CORBA namespace.
            Defining them in the global namespace as they were makes
            them easily hidden, and we know that the compiler will
            eventually look in the scope of the rhs operand, and thus
            will always find the CORBA::Exception overload. Thanks
            to Hans Utz <hans.utz@informatik.uni-ulm.de> for the
            suggestion.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_type.h:

          Since char, octet and boolean are usually ambiguous types
          in the ORB, specializing an Arg_Traits<> class for an
          argument that is a typedef of one of these types requires
          that we strip the typedef to find the correct parameter
          with which to specialize Arg_Traits<>. This fix introduces
          that behavior. Thanks to Simon Dutkowski
          <dutkowski@fokus.fraunhofer.de> for reporting the bug.

        * tests/IDL_Test/interface.idl:

          in place for structs, unions and exceptions.

        * performance-tests/Latency/Thread_Per_Connection/Roundtrip.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Client/test_i.cpp:

          The best fix for the problem outlined is "Sat Jan 10 21:17:10
          2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" to
          wait for all threads exit () before finishing shutting down the
          ORB_Core. I was trying to avoid this with earlier checkins.

          The cost of avoiding this can be catostrophical though it doesn't
          show up for us. We now explicitly call shutdown with a boolean
          flag to prevent the crash. We have now moved the configuration
          details to the application, but looks like it is hard to avoid.

          decrement the  refcount in the destructor. This may not be
          required at all. This is required only for the
          thread-per-connection model. A shutdown () call from a remote
          host could potentially cleanup the whole ORB and call ORB::fini
          () before the thread in svc_i () can try calling has_shutdown ()
          to exit out of the svc_i () loop. This could cause a crash. To
          prevent that from happening we will increment the refcount. With
          reactive model this is not be needed at all, since all the
          threads are  kicked out of the reactor before the ORB is
          shutdown by the closing thread.

          Thanks to valgrind for helping me catch this. This should have
          slipped through for a very long time, if my guess is right.

          Added hash table to match #pragma prefix directives with
          file names. This table is used to manage the prefix associated
          with the root scope. Using preprocessor file directives, as
          was done previously, is not sufficient. This change enables
          the calculation of the repository id, which contains the prefix,
          to be done sooner, at AST node creation time, since the root
          prefix is updated with each file change and with each prefix
          directive. This fix closes [BUGID:1687]. Thanks to Terry Ware

          occurs. Thanks to Markus Stenberg

          is crazy, but that is what the daily builds want. Grrr..

Sun Jan  4 20:17:07 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Makefile.main:

          Added the smart proxy library to the link line.

Sun Jan 4 16:04:03 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Utils/Server_Main.cpp:

          Another wrong macros usage problem.

Sun Jan 4 16:01:03 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/FT_App/FT_App.mpc:

          Prevented a bunch of compilations by making exceptions=1 a
          requirement. There is no scope or hope for this to be fixed in
          the next day or two. Things are too borken in the CPP files,
          esepcially there are some macros that have been used that are
          broken for exceptions=0. x.4 will have this example only
          compilable with exceptions=1.

          Attempt to fix some of the macro usage problems. Please see
          above.

Sun Jan  4 09:55:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.h:
          Added missing type of inheritence from base class. Fixes Tru64
          warning.

Sun Jan  4 09:23:56 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/examples/Notify/Lanes/Notify_Lanes.mpc:
          Supplier needs naming

Sun Jan  4 08:24:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/FaultTolerance/GroupRef_Manipulation/client.bor:
          Fixed this borland makefile for static build

Sat Jan  3 23:56:03 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/FTEC_Event_Channel_Impl.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/Request_Context_Repository.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/Set_Update_Interceptor.cpp:

          The last checkin actually broke g++ builds. Slightly corrected
          the fix by calling the cast operator so that it works in both
          the compilers.

Sat Jan  3 11:23:51 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Collocation.dsp:

          Fixed the dsp file for the debug configuration.

          Fixed compile errors with Borland. Thanks to Johnny for
          reporting them.

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Coll_Test_Stubs.bor:
        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Diamond.bor:
          Fixed these BCB makefiles.

Fri Jan  2 23:22:14 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        This fix should have gone in long time back. Since this is
        non-intrusive and needed by a sponsor it was decided to checkin.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Added a command line option -ORBDisableRTCollocation. This is
          useful for applications that would like to disable RT
          collocation with RTORB and use the default collocation features
          instead. Most notably this is being added for Boeing.

        * tao/params.cpp:
        * tao/params.h:
        * tao/params.i:

          Added a new boolean variable to the class, together with
          accessors and mutators. The new boolean caches the value of the
          above option passed to the ORB by the application.

        * tao/RTPortableServer/RT_Object_Adapter_Factory.cpp:

          Do a check before setting the collocation resolver name and
          intializing the service configurator with the new directive.

Fri Jan  2 14:50:38 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Coll_Tester.cpp:
        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Smart_Proxy_Impl.h:

          Cosmetic fixes!

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Makefile.Coll_Test_Stubs:
        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Makefile.Diamond:
        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Makefile.main:

          Fixed the makefiles so that they can build properly in our daily
          builds.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Utils.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/Portable_Group_Map.h:

          Added #include for portablegroup_export.h.  Since one of the
          CosLoadBalancing idl files includes PortableGroup.idl, the
          generated PortableGroupC.h and PortableGroupS.h may or may not
          have #include "portablegroup_export.h" in them or not.  So, we
          don't rely on that and explicitly include it in these header
          files.

Fri Jan  2 14:07:21 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV_Static.dsp:

          Changed the md5c.c to md5c.cpp.

Fri Jan 02 13:09:19 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Collocation.dsp:
        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Smart_Proxies.dsp:

          Fixed the release and debug build configurations.

Fri Jan  2 12:39:15 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.av:

          Updated dependancies. Moved a 'C' source to the CPP source list
          since it was decided to rname a C file as a CPP file.

Fri Jan  2 11:56:04 2004  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Makefile.bor:

          Added a new sub-directory Manage_Object_Group to be compiled.

Fri Jan  2 11:37:09 2004  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/LB_server.cpp:

          Made changes to fix the CannotMeetCriteria exception being
          thrown in some builds.

Fri Jan  2 10:00:48 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV.mpc:

          Changed md5c.c to md5c.cpp and removed a duplicate md5c.h entry in
          the Header_Files section.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/md5c.c:

          Renamed this file to md5c.cpp to avoid build problems for some
          64-bit UNIX platforms.

Fri Jan  2 00:59:33 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        The following changes work around a problem introduced by "magic"
        static constructors in the TAO PortableServer headers where
        dynamic loading/unloading of the ORB failed.  TAO's singleton
        manager must be explicitly initialized to avoid registering itself
        with the ACE_Object_Manager in the DLL ORB case.  The static
        constructors in the PortableServer library were causing the
        TAO_Singleton_Manager to be implicitly initialized.  In that case,
        the TAO_Singleton_Manager will register itself with the
        ACE_Object_Manager, thus preventing DLL ORB loading/unloading from
        from functioning properly.

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Time_Date.h:
        * examples/Simple/time-date/Time_Date.cpp:

          Removed all dependencies on the TAO_ORB_Manager.  It implicitly
          introduces the static "magic" constructors that prevent DLL ORB
          loading/unloading from functioning properly.

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Time_Date_Client_i.h:
        * examples/Simple/time-date/client.cpp:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Time_Date_i.h (Time_Date_i):

          Reference count the servant to improve memory management.

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Time_Date_i.cpp:

          Removed no-op constructor and destructor.  The compiler
          generated versions satisfy our needs.

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Makefile (server):

          No need to link "../Simple_util.o" object file in the server
          binary.

          (LDLIBS, ACE_SHLIBS, client):

          Explicitly link CosNaming related libraries only to client
          binary.  The server and libTime_Date binaries do not depend on
          the CosNaming related libraries.

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Simple_time_date.mpc:
        * examples/Simple/time-date/client.bor:
        * examples/Simple/time-date/server.bor:
        * examples/Simple/time-date/time_date.bor:

          Likewise.

        * tao/Utils/Server_Main.cpp:
          Fixed emulated exception usage. This is one of the problems I see
          in the FT_App orbsvcs tests, but there are several more

Fri Jan  2 08:20:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/examples/RtEC/IIOPGateway/Supplier.cpp:

Fri Jan  2 08:17:33 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Time_Date.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_obv_cs.cpp:

          Fixed a problem with scoping the DefaultValueRefcountBase. This
          showed up as a problem with Borland. Thanks to Johnny for

        * rules.tao.GNU:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Added new variable, security, that defaults =0, and can be set
          =1 to build libTAO_Security.  This allows you to build projects
          that depend on libTAO_Security, but don't depend on
          libTAO_SSLIOP or ssl.

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Makefile.main:

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Simple_time_date.mpc:
          Removed idl_flags, they are not set in the original project files and
          cause problems in the VC71 build

Thu Jan  1 08:49:18 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:

          Use flat_name () instead of local_name () while generating code
          for create_proxy. Thanks to Christoph for reminding me to do
          this.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:

          Fixed code generation for smart proxies. We never invoked the
          smart proxy during a _narrow () or _unchecked_narrow (). Our
          great tests are simply of no use to detect such important
          problems.  This should fix [BUGID 1697]. Thanks to Chris Liebig
          for reporting this problem.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/lib/Command_Factory_T.h:

          Fixed a warning with g++.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/marshal_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/rettype_marshal_ss.cpp:

          Added check in generated code for a null value when marshaling an
          out or return sequence argument into a reply. If such a
          case is detected, the generated check will marshal an empty
          sequence. This fix addresses one of the issues in [BUGID:1677].

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/amh_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_interface.h:

          Fixed bug that caused the generation of base class constructor
          calls in AMH interface class copy constructors to get skipped.
          The queue of parent interfaces that the IDL compiler uses
          internally to facilitate the traversal of the inheritance
          graph of a derived interface was not getting seeded with the
          derived interface itself, preventing the further population
          of the queue.

Wed Dec 31 10:13:48 2003  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Base.pidl:

          CORBA::RepositoryId since they are already defined in orb.idl.

Tue Dec 30 13:20:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.PortableGroup:

          Need to link in IOManip library. If not done, dynamic loading
          of this library starts failing which is bad. I almost had a
          scare now and I thought that our service configurator was
          broken.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Connection_Handler.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Miop/McastHello/Makefile:

          No need to link in the libraries as done here. The test works
          with dynamic libraries and should work as such. Linking in
          libraries only tries to mask teh errors.

          Fix for [BUGID 1693]. Thanks to Christoph Liebig
          <xfrog2000@yahoo.com> for reporting the problem.

          Please see

          http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1693

          for an outline of the problem. The problem showed up because the
          Any_Basic_Impl::extract () didn't handle alias TCKind's
          right. Previously we used to do everything using the type
          information by which the class was parametrized. Once we opened
          things up, we started seeing problems with irrgular handling of
          TCKinds. Two overloaded methods assign_value () and
          demarshal_value () which take in TCKinds have been. We now use
          the TCKind's that were passed in while the call to extract ()
          was made. Since the equivalency of the typecodes have been
          checked already using the original value of TCKind should not be
          an issue.

          New files that never founds its way into the Makefile.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Object_Group.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Object_Group_Manipulator.h:

          Fixed some obvious abuse of ACE_ENV macros.

Fri Dec 26 14:29:01 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

          When using dynamic_hash or other techniques the generated code
          was not initilaizing the hash_map with the right members. This
          lead to operation name registration failures. This fix corrects
          that problem. Atleast a couple of simple tests pass with this
          fix. Time for a new build with this option.

Fri Dec 26 13:16:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.dsp:

          turned off.

Fri Dec 26 00:43:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.pidl:

          The pragms prefix in this file was throwing up strange errors
          under stramge circumstances. Jeff needs to look into this. Till
          then we will keep things moving along.

          Fixed the borland files after the last change. I am sure they
          are not perfect. Need to wait for the builds to make the next
          round of fixes.

Thu Dec 25 23:41:49 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          Changes that needed to be done from the change "Thu Dec 25
          17:41:44 2003 Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>". Removed unnecessray dependancies
          that were added. We now include the stub from
          PortableGroup_Simple_DS.idl in every project with any export
          definitions. This was easier and far better than having multiple
          libraries.

Thu Dec 25 18:56:58 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FTORB.mpc:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.mpc:

          Set right the dependancies in the MPC files.

        The remainder of this checkin is for an optimization. The point is
        to cache the hash value of the endpoints. I am sure there are
        people who believe that with latest versions of the kernels,
        stacks and quantum computing these optimizations are a
        waste. Whatever it is, my profiler showed a bit of time spent
        trying to calculate hash values in every call path. Hence the
        decision to cache the value.

        * tao/Endpoint.h:
        * tao/Endpoint.i:

          Added a varaible to hold the cached hash value.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Endpoint.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Endpoint.cpp:

        * tao/IIOP_Endpoint.cpp:

        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Endpoint.h:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Endpoint.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Endpoint.cpp:

          Double checked locking optimizations to cache the hash value.

        * tests/MT_Client/client.global.conf:

          Removed a svc.conf option that has long been retired.

Thu Dec 25 17:41:44 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup_Simple_DS.idl:

          Moved some of the typedefs and data structures that are used by
          other services into this file. For example FT_CORBA_ORB.idl just
          includes 3 typedefs and a struct in PortableGroup.idl which it
          was doing by including PortableGroup.idl. This lead to
          dependancy between FT_CORBA_ORB and PortableGroup. This also
          dependancy also lead to teh dependancies of PortableGroup being
          imposed on FT_CORBA_ORB, which were all nasty in the first
          place. This seperate IDL file will clean a bunch of things up.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_CORBA_ORB.idl:

          These IDL files include only the above IDL file.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:

          Removed the dependancy of PortableGroup on FTORB. There is no
          need for this. Further cleaned up the dependancy on
          Notification and Naming. The whole idea of splitting the
          FT_CORBA IDL into two pieces months before was to avoid this
          dependancy. Adding this dependancy defeats the purpose. A
          dependancy has been setup between PortableGroup and FTORB. This
          is just for the generated code and not a library dependancy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.FTORB:

          Added the PortableGroup_Simple_DS.idl for compilation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.PortableGroup:

          Added the generated code from PortableGroup_Simple_DS.idl for
          cmpilation and linking.

        * orbsvcs/examples/FaultTolerance/RolyPoly/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/FaultTolerance/GroupRef_Manipulation/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/FaultTolerance/IOGR/Makefile:

          Does not link in Messaging library.

Thu Dec 25 11:09:50 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FTORB_Utils.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ClientORB.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ServerORB.dsp:

          They needed more massaging. They now depend on portable group
          and CosNaming. This is not fun. If I were doing things, I would
          have split the required definitions into a seperate IDL file and
          include the generated code in both the projects. This is simply
          not right!

Wed Dec 24 20:06:01 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FTORB_Utils.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ClientORB.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ServerORB.dsp:

          All of them needed Messaging libraries in both debug and release
          builds.

Wed Dec 24 19:41:43 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/FaultTolerance/GroupRef_Manipulation/Makefile:

          Needed extra libraries to link fine on static builds.

          Reverting the change "Wed Dec 24 14:15:24 2003  Balachandran
          Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>", since it had the reverse
          effect. The executable started linking in *A.* files since the
          typecodes for exceptions were placed in these files.

          More painful code hacking. Maintenance is harder, but we don't
          have a choice right away. Moved all the typecodes from *C.* to
          *A.* files.

        * tao/IIOP_Endpoints.pidl:
        * tao/IOP_IOR.pidl:

          Painful code movements. Moved all the typecode declarations
          from *C.* files to *A.* files. This is maintenance hard, but no
          gains without pains. Sorry we have to do this to get the
          footprint reductions.

        * tao/diffs/Current.diff:
        * tao/diffs/CONV_FRAME.diff:
        * tao/diffs/IIOP.diff:

          Regenerated diffs with the above changes.

          Added the generated Any files into the repository. These were
          not in the repository before. This was due to a bug in the IDL
          compiler which was fixed in "Thu Nov 20 20:12:37 2003  Jeff
          Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>". We never updated the

          Provided interfaces that can be called by the generated

Tue Dec 23 20:14:45 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Reformatted the inter-library dependencies to make them more

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_arg_traits.cpp:

          Changes to get the generated code to compile if gperf is not
          available. There have been questiosn from users in the past
          whether they can avoid using gperf genereated code. To prevent
          suprises for those users we have to get the generated code
          compiling for every strategy that we support or remove those
          strategies which we can't maintain ;).

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/ServerInterceptorAdapter.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/ServerInterceptorAdapter.h:

          Added an #define TAO_HAS_EXTENDED_FT_INTERCEPTORS, to protect
          the extended interceptor call. The extended call is only for our
          FT capabilities and is proprietary. A compliant implementation
          of an application level PortableInterceptor will start running
          into trouble without this #define. This change is to protect
          compliant implementations of application intereceptors from
          having any surprises.

        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile:
        * tests/IDL_Test/keywords.idl:

          Added a test case for the bug report from Cyrille. The fix went
          in this change "Tue Dec 23 09:47:27 2003  Jeff Parsons
          <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>". The IDL file has the exact
          construction that Cyrille reported. We now by default generate
          AMI code if ami==1 in the IDL_Test. Therefore we link in the
          Messaging library too.

Tue Dec 23 09:47:27 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_decl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ami_pre_proc.cpp:

          Fixed incorrect dropping of _cxx_ prefix in parameter name (if
          it clashes with a C++ keyword) of AMI sendc_* operation. Thanks
          to  Cyrille Chplov <cyrille@softek.fr> for reporting the bug.

          Because these tutorials using orbsvcs, base the projects on
          orbsvcsexe instead of taoexe because with taoexe we lack the
          $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs include path

Tue Dec 23 10:22:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Coll_Tester.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.av:
          Modified this makefile to explicitly include wrapper_macros.GNU,
          etc., so it can test for rapi and sctp and include additional
          files in LSRC if either is defined.  Thanks to Craig Rodrigues
          <crodrigu@bbn.com> for finding the problem and supplying the
          patch.

Mon Dec 22 17:43:12 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tao/Any_Dual_Impl_T.{h,cpp}:
          Added new protected method, value(const T &), and moved the
          ACE_NEW for value from the ctor to this method.  The ctor now
          calls this method instead of doing the ACE_NEW itself which
          allows us the ability to specialize a regular method instead of
          a ctor since some compilers have trouble specializing ctor's that
          initialize base classes.

        * tao/Exception.cpp:
          Removed the ctor specialization for Any_Dual_Impl_T and replaces
          it with a specialization of value() since some compilers could
          grok the former.

Mon Dec 22 11:29:39 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          fixes in later once we have a way to get around the

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.h:

          Added virtual method to the be_visitor_interface_ss visitor called
          genrerate_send_reply, which is a no-op, but when overridden
          in the be_visitor_amh_interface_ss visitor, generates an explicit
          send_reply call on _tao_server_request. This new method is then
          used in the generation of the _is_a_skel, _nonexistent_skel,
          _interface_skel, and _component_skel methods, and the explicit
          send_reply call gets generated for the AMH version of the
          interface. This addition was needed because the above generated
          methods need a reply to be sent right away, and this is not
          handled under the hood in asynchronous_upcall_dispatch() as it
          is in synchronous_upcall_dispatch(). This fix closes

        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp (handle_system_exception):

          Corrected repository IDs for non-fatal system exceptions being
          detected (TRANSIENT, OBJ_ADAPTER, NO_RESPONSE).  The
          "IDL:omg.org/CORBA/" prefix and ":1.0" suffix were missing, thus
          preventing code that should have been run in the presence of
          these exceptions from being run.

          Attempt to try another profile in the non-fatal exception case.
          This fixes a problem where valid profiles were not retried when
          they should have been.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LeastLoaded.h
          (LL_DEFAULT_LOAD_PERCENT_DIFF_CUTOFF):

          New constant used in thundering herd fix described below.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LeastLoaded.cpp (get_location):

          Fixed problem where least loaded object group member was not
          always selected, thus reducing scalability.

          If two locations have loads that differ by a "small" amount
          (i.e. LL_DEFAULT_LOAD_PERCENT_DIFF_CUTOFF), choose one of them
          at random.  This helps alleviate a thundering herd phenomenon
          that could occur when an object group member becomes available
          for request handling.  Thanks to Carlos, Marina and Jody at ATD
          for coming up with this solution to this form of the thundering
          herd problem.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_ServerRequestInterceptor.cpp
          (receive_request_service_contexts):

          Always allow LoadMonitor and LoadAlert operations to proceed
          regardless of the alert condition.  Addresses a problem where it
          was not possible to disable alert states and query loads from a
          LoadMonitor collocated with a server once a load alert was
          enabled.

        * orbsvcs/performance-tests/LoadBalancing/ORBInitializer.h:

          Improved documentation of some class members.

        * orbsvcs/performance-tests/LoadBalancing/ORBInitializer.cpp:

          Cosmetic change.

        * orbsvcs/performance-tests/LoadBalancing/RPS_Monitor.cpp (loads):

          If the elapsed-time is zero, set the load to zero to prevent a
          division-by-zero error.

        * orbsvcs/performance-tests/LoadBalancing/Roundtrip.cpp
          (test_method):

          Commented out a bunch of code that should not be used when
          performing benchmarks.

          Integrated aggregate fix to infamous Parse Magic Bytes (PMB)
          problem.  The fix was originally developed in OCI's repository
          and migrated here.  An overall description of the problem and
          solution follow, and a detailed changelog that follows the
          development of this solution follows this entry.

          The old way of handling input naively assumed that a header would
          never be broken across multiple read()s from the socket.  Back in
          the old days, this assumption was okay, because TAO performed a
          recv_n() specifically for the header, and thus insured that it
          wouldn't get less than a full header.  However, when it was
          changed to use a single read, that no longer worked.

          Further complicating matters was the incoming message queue, and
          the myriad of methods that manipulated elements on the message
          queue.

          The PMB changes rework things in the following ways:

          1. The incoming message queue now holds only completely-read
          GIOP messages awaiting processing.  Each GIOP message is held in
          a heap-allocated ACE_Message_Block.  When the message has been
          processed, the processing code is responsible for calling
          release on the queued message to return the memory to the heap.

          2. Since GIOP, by definition, assumes an ordered byte stream,
          there can be only one partially read, i.e., uncompleted, message;
          this is now held explicitly in TAO_Transport::uncompleted_message_
          as a pointer to a heap-allocated ACE_Message_Block of the exact
          correct size for the GIOP message.

          3. States for reading from the transport have been explicitly
          defined rather than implied from values of other data members.

          This change also correctly handles correct receipt of GIOP
          fragments:

          a. In the case of a GIOP 1.2 fragment, each fragment is a complete
          GIOP message.  It is, however, unable to be processed until all
          fragments have arrived.

          b. Unlike a TCP segment, a GIOP fragment is not stateless; all
          GIOP 1.2 fragments for a specific request must be sent in-order.
          However, with transport multiplexing, other messages--including
          fragments for other requests--may interleave these fragments.

          c. By design, there is no way to know the total number of payload
          bytes across all GIOP fragments until the final fragment is
          received.

          optimization.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_State.cpp (TAO_Debug_Msg_Emitter_Guard):
          Improved implementation so it didn't make copies of the message
          even when it was never going to output anything due to debug
          level being lower than the value that would cause debug output.

          Moved to inline file.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.h (TAO_Incoming_Message_Queue):
          Changed name of member 'queued_data_' to 'last_added_' to be
          more clear about what the pointer actually points to.

          Added documentation that describes the structure of the linked
          list so that hopefully future maintainers don't have to go
          through the same learning curve I did.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.*: Updates to reflect last_added_
          member name change.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp (dequeue_head): Add check to not
          allow dequeuing when size is zero, plus we now zero-out the
          last_added_ pointer after we've dequeued the last item in the
          list.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp (clone_mb_nocopy_size): Fix
          setting and copying of flags on the message and data blocks so
          that the DONT_DELETE flag specifically doesn't get copied.  This
          cured a HUGE memory leak that was causing substantial
          performance problems.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp (make_uncompleted_message):
        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp (make_completed_message):

        * tao/Transport.cpp (handle_input_i):

          Added flag noting that we enqueued a message.

          Changed how re-reading is performed; see entry for
          try_to_complete for information.

          Used ACE_CDR::grow to grow the uncompleted_message message block
          once the payload size is known.  This insures that the growth
          happens with proper alignment constraints.

        * tao/Transport.* (try_to_complete): Added this method which
          tries to complete whatever partial message is held in
          uncompleted_message_.  The difference between doing this and
          simply revisiting the top of handle_input_i is that this will
          only try to read enough to complete the message rather than also
          read another partial.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (process_queue_head): Added check to insure
          that we don't try to do any processing when there's nothing in
          the queue.  Also, removed old code leftover from when the
          incoming queue could have partial GIOP messages in it.  Finally,
          insured that the return value matched previous requirements.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp: Removed Shattering Encapsulation
          hack around ace/Message_Block.h inclusion to make this link
          properly on VC6.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_State.cpp: Moved initialization of
          TAO_Debug_Msg_Emitter_Guard::MAGIC_LENGTH outside the class
          declaration.

Wed Mar  5 13:08:37 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_Impl.inl (check_revision):
          Modified to only explicitly allow versions of GIOP that TAO
          supports, and no others.  Note that this change means that
          whenever a new version of GIOP gets added to TAO, this function
          must be updated, too.  Hopefully that won't happen so often that
          this becomes horribly burdensome.  Thanks to Chad Elliott and
          Paul Calabrese for ideas in getting this right.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.* (make_uncompleted_message):

          This now behaves similar to make_completed_message, i.e., it
          allocates the message block held in TAO_Queued_Data and advnaced
          the rd_ptr past the bytes it consumes.

        * tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp: Eliminated hacks on
          ACE_Message_Block and replaced with functions
          clone_mb_nocopy_size() and copy_mb_span() that utilize ONLY the
          public API.  make_completed_message() and
          make_uncompleted_message() now use these.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (handle_input_i): Enlarged the buffer size and
          replaced the magic number for the maximum number of re-read
          attempts with the manifest constant
          TAO_MAX_TRANSPORT_REREAD_ATTEMPTS, now defined in orbconf.h.

          Changed uses of make_uncompleted_message() to be consistent with
          changes outlined above.

          Corrected a bug where, upon re-reading after completely emptying
          the stack-allocated message block, I forgot to reset the
          rd_ptr/wr_ptr in the message block.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added new manifest constant
          TAO_MAX_TRANSPORT_REREAD_ATTEMPTS.  Documentation is in the file.

Wed Feb 26 21:44:34 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * TAO/tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_Impl.inl:

          Reimplement check_revision() to be exact about which GIOP
          revisions are okay.  This is different from before where it
          loosely assumed that everything was valid unless it want higher
          than a particular range.

        * TAO/tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.cpp:

          Remove parse_incoming_messages() thru consolidate_fragments();

          Change CTOR not to use the 2nd argument.

          Change CTOR not to initialize this->base_with the 2nd arg.

          Add take_values_from_message_block().

          Remove parse_magic_bytes(), parse_message_header_i(),
          parse_message_header().

          Rename get_version_info() to set_version_info_from_buffer();
          change argument type to 'const char*'.

          Rename get_byte_order_info() to set_byte_order_info_from_buffer();
          change argument type to 'const char*'.

          Rename get_payload_size() to set_payload_size_from_buffer();
          change argument type to 'const char*'.

          Change argument type for read_ulong() to 'const char*'.

        * TAO/tao/GIOP_Message_State.h:

          Add default value for CTOR arguments so we don't have to pass
          them.

          Add declaration for take_values_from_message_block().

          #if0 parse_message_header() declaration.

          Add documentation for byte_order().

          Add new GIOP information accessors: giop_version(),
          more_fragments(), and message_type().

          #if0 declaration for parse_message_header_i() and
          parse_magic_bytes().

          Rename delcarations for get_version_info(), get_byte_order_info(),
          and get_payload_size().

          #if0 base_ member variable.

        * TAO/tao/GIOP_Message_State.inl:

          Add definitions for giop_version(), more_fragments(), and
          message_type().

        * TAO/tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp:

          Add #include for ace/Message_Block.h, but shatter encapsulation
          and effectively extend its interface so that we can clone spans of
          message blocks.

          Modify copy_tail() to use new TAO_Queued_Data member names.

        * TAO/tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.cpp (class TAO_Queued_Data):

          Update CTORs to initialize new this->current_state_ data member.

          Add new make_uncompleted_message(), ACE_Message_Block hack
          "extensions", make_completed_message().

          Rename get_queued_data() to make_queued_data().

        * TAO/tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.h:

          Changed #include <Pluggable_Messaging_Utils.h> to #include
          <Pluggable_Messaging.h>

          Documentation for is_tail_complete() and is_head_complete() and
          is_tail_fragmented().

          #if0 get_node().

        * TAO/tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.h (class TAO_Queued_Data):

          Make CTORs protected so creation can only go through new factory
          methods, i.e., make_completed_message() and
          make_uncompleted_message().

          Add new factory methods make_completed_message() and
          make_uncompleted_message().

          Add release() method [in addition to static of same name].

          Add explicit definition of various states and a member to hold the
          current state (this->current_state_).

          Rename this->missing_data_ flag/value with
          this->missing_data_bytes_ count.

          Documentation for this->byte_order_.

        * TAO/tao/Incoming_Message_Queue.inl:

          Replace uses of this->missing_data_ with
          this->missing_data_bytes_.

          #if0 get_node().

          Add release() method.

          Add #include <ace/Min_Max.h>

          Add uncompleted_message_ to initialization list.

          Modify what happens when reading in handle_input_i():

          - number_of_read_attempts is how many times we'll try to read
          again to complete a message before we give up.

          - read_from_the_connection label added

          - correct 1st argument to this->recv() to be wr_ptr() rather than
          rd_ptr().

          - lots of changes that are substantially documented in the code.

          #if0 parse_consolidate_messages(), parse_incoming_messages(),
          missing_data(), consolidate_message(), consolidate_fragments(),
          consolidate_message_queue(), consolidate_extra_messages(), and
          make_queued_data().

        * TAO/tao/Transport.h:

          #if0 declarations for parse_consolidate_messages(), parse_incoming_messages(),
          missing_data(), consolidate_message(), consolidate_fragments(),

          Add this->uncompleted_message_ data member.

        * TAO/tao/Strategies/DIOP_Transport.cpp:

          Change 1st arg of this->recv() in handle_input_i() to wr_ptr()
          from rd_ptr().

          #if0 consolidate_message().

        * TAO/tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Transport.h:

          #if0 declaration for consolidate_message().

        * TAO/tests/AMI/run_test.pl:

          Increase default number of iterations from 1 to 10000.  Earlier
          versions of the PMB changes succeeded just fine with low numbers
          of iterations, but began to fail miserably when the number of
          iterations climbed.

        * TAO/tests/BiDirectional/run_test.pl:

          Added level 10 debug.

        * TAO/tests/InterOp-Naming/INS_test_client.cpp:

          Changes that don't appear to be related in any way to PMB...

Wed Dec 10 15:12:34 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Collocation/Smart_Proxy_Impl.cpp:
          Removed not used local variable

Wed Dec 10 07:08:30 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsNotifyLogAdmin.mpc:

          This project should inherit from dseventlogadmin instead of
          inheriting from dslogadmin and directly referencing the
          DsEventLogAdmin library and project.

Wed Dec 10 06:31:53 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Bug_1630_Regression/Makefile.Bug_1630_testclient:

          Do not compile if minimum_corba is enabled.

          BTW, this test and the Makefiles needs cleaning up. Will get to
          that soon.

Wed Dec 10 06:12:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Bug_1395_Regression/Makefile.Bug_1395_Server:

          Fixed the link lines in the Makefiles.

Wed Dec 10 11:42:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bug_1330_Regression/Bug_1330_Client.dsp:
          Fixed release configuration, this should be the last for the
          1.3.6 release

Wed Dec 10 10:25:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Collocation_Tests/Collocation_Tests.mpc:
          Fixed executable name to match with run_test.pl

Wed Dec 10 10:08:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Logging/Logger.idl:
        * examples/Logging/Logger_i.cpp:
        * examples/Logging/Logger_i.h:
        * examples/Logging/Logging_Test_i.cpp:
          Changed log2 to log_twoway and logv2 to logv_twoway. On Cygwin
          log2 is a macro and using this macro name in IDL gives a lot
          of errors in the Cygwin build. Just renaming the methods is the
          way to fix this.

Wed Dec 10 09:41:41 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile:
          Removed Bug_1393_Regrestion, Bug_1436_Regression and
          Bug_1437_Regression from these makefile, there are no GNU makefiles
          in those directories that work.

Wed Dec 10 09:26:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_TypedEventChannel.{h,cpp}:
          Fixed some method argument names which where exactly the same as
          the name of some members.

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_ExtendedC.cpp:

          Removed more duplicate explicit template instantiations.

Tue Dec  9 18:25:27 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance.mpc:

          Added a dependency on CosNaming.

Tue Dec  9 18:22:35 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile:

          Added a bunch of new tests into the Makefiles for compilation.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Bug_1630_Regression/testclient.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation error.

Tue Dec  9 15:17:47 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/field_cs.cpp (visit_union):

          Fixed code generation for accessors/mutators to a union as a
          member of a valuetype. The previous, incorrect code assumed that
          the member is declared as a union_var, which is not the case.
          Thanks to Andy Bellafaire <Andy_M_Bellafaire@raytheon.com> for
          pointing out the problem.

Tue Dec  9 14:07:28 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation.cpp (gen_stub_operation_body);

          Fixed calculation of operation name string length when the name has
          a '_cxx_' prefix due to a name class with a C++ keyword.

Tue Dec  9 13:42:00 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_defn.cpp (gen_nested_namespace_end):

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_ComponentsC.cpp:
        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_ExtendedC.cpp:

          Regenerated IFR_ComponentsC.cpp, to get the correct indentation since
          the fix above, and from all files listed, removed duplicate explicit
          template instantiations of the argument template helper classes.

Tue Dec  9 18:38:12 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.CosTime:
          Removed #include of wrapper_macros.GNU and rules.tao.GNU since
          they are included automagically by all_in_one.GNU.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> tracking this down.

Tue Dec  9 11:37:44 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/extra_core.mpb:

          For some reason there are so many places where we have hardcoded
          that  minimum_corba means no messaging. This is atrocious :-).

        * tests/Bug_1639_Regression/test.mpc:

          Cleaned the MPC file.

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Only set SOVERSION and SONAME if versioned_so=1 and they have
          not yet been set.  Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic
          <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> for motivating this change.

Mon Dec  8 19:33:03 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:

          Fixed a minor problem with reinvocation. We were not handling
          errors properly, more precisely the restart errors if they show
          up during wait_for_reply (). Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic for
          motivating this change.

        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Invocation.cpp:

          Cosmetic change.

Mon Dec  8 18:50:58 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_decl.cpp:

          Cosmetic changes to source code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation.cpp:

          In generating the operation string name passed to the
          TAO::Invocation_Adapter constructor in stub code, changed
          the call to get the operation node's local name from
          local_name() to original_local_name(). This call returns a
          string without the '_cxx_' prepended (if any) that would
          occur if the operation name clashes with a C++ keyword. The
          name string must be passed to the transport without the
          prefix so it can be language independent, and for this
          reason it will also be stored in the operation table on the
          skeleton side in the same way (without the prefix).

Mon Dec  8 12:49:52 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/examples/PSS/PSS.mpc:

          Removed from the repository so that our daily builds will not
          run this to get a Makefile. We will not be supporting PSDL for
          TAO 1.4.

Sat Dec  6 23:42:13 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        This checkin is a fix for the various race conditions in Asynch
        Invocation reported by Cyrille Chepelov. The various race
        conditions were

          - Race between threads trying to dispatch replies and timeouts
          - Race between threads propogating timeouts and propogating
            replies.

        The crux of the changes involved adding refcounts to the
        Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher and Asynch_Timeout_Handler. To handle
        these cleanly I have made some supplementary change like moving
        Auto_Functor to the TAO library from Utils library, since it is
        more useful for a bunch of things.

        * tao/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher_Base.cpp
        * tao/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher_Base.h:
        * tao/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher_Base.i:

          Added refcounting to this class. Further added a Functor which
          can be used by Auto_Functor.

        * tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp:

          Fixed a duplicate debug statement in dispatch_reply ().

        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Invocation_Adapter.cpp:

          Use Auto_Functor instead of auto_ptr <> since the reply
          dispatcher cannot be deleted, but can only be refcounted.

        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp::
        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher.h:

          The reply dispatcher creates a timeout handler when
          schedule_timer is called and holds a refcount of the timeout
          handler. The calls close_connection (), dispatch_reply () and
          reply_timed_out () doesn't call delete this, but decrements the
          refcount.

        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Timeout_Handler.cpp:

          Enable refcounting of the timeout handler. This object holds a
          refcounted reply dispatcher object. Will decrement the refcount
          of the reply dispatcher when the object is destroyed.

        * tao/Makefile.tao:
        * tao/Auto_Functor.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Moved the autofunctor class form the Utils library to the TAO
          library.

        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Invocation_Adapter.cpp:
        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Reply_Dispatcher.h:

          Replicated the changes made in the Asynch classes to DII
          classes.

        * tao/Utils/Implicit_Deactivator.h:
        * tao/Utils/ORB_Destroyer.h:

          Changed the include path for Auto_Functor.h

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_traits.h:

          Renamed be_visit_struct() method be_visit_structure() so it
          overrides the base class method.

        * examples/Advanced/README_DOCGROUP:

          A README file that explains why we cannot support the following
          examples anymore.

        * examples/Advanced/ch_12/Advanced_ch_12.mpc:
        * examples/Advanced/ch_18/Advanced_ch_18.mpc:
        * examples/Advanced/ch_21/Advanced_ch_21.mpc:

          Removed all these MPC files. These directories will not be
          henceforth compiled  in the daily builds. The reason is
          explained in the file above. The crux of the problem is the
          dependancy between the examples and old iostream
          library. Graduating them to the new iostream library introduces
          lots of changes and does break code with old iostream library. I
          don't think the doc_group will have any time in the near future
          to get these examples compiling reliably with older and new
          generation of compilers. If someone can give patches we will, as
          usual, integrate them.

          Changed the names of enum declarations "NONE" in these
          files. This was causing a clash with VxWORKS systems
          headers. Thanks to Thomas Lockhart for providing the patches.

Thu Dec  4 14:15:51 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/TypeCodeFactory/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp (unique_label_values):

          Assigned a struct literal to a local struct variable instead
          of initializing each member individually. This enables
          TypeCodeFactory to build when ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T is defined,
          since the struct contains all the IDL basic types that are
          legal for union discriminators, including longlong. Thanks
          to Gary Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com> for reporting the problem.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/FT_ClientORBInitializer.cpp:
          Removed registering policy factory for HEARTBEAT_ENABLED_POLICY
          which should be specific to FT server ORB.

Sun Nov 30 12:15:45 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/performance-tests/RTEvent/RTCORBA_Baseline/client.cpp:

          Added missing include of ace/Barrier.h.

          Added project dependencies.

Sun Nov 30 10:44:41 2003  Huang-Ming Huang  <hh1@cse.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Fault_Tolerance_Service.cpp
          Fixed the problem for the seperation of FTORB libraries.
          FT_Service_Activate is changed to FT_ClientService_Activate.

Sat Nov 29 20:27:19 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ch.cpp:

          Since the local variable that was supposed to be removed in

          Sat Nov 29 11:13:06 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          has be put back in

          Sat Nov 29 19:40:45 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          went the other way, and referenced the local variable later in
          the method, instead of calling the accessor again.

Sat Nov 29 19:40:45 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ch.cpp:

          Fixed an unused variable warning.

Sat Nov 29 12:45:02 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAOACE.dsw:

          Changes to project dependencies. In particular, eliminated the
          dependency of Fault Tolerance on FT ORB, which no longer
          exists.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FTORB_Utils.dsp:

          Added dependency on IDL compiler executable so code will get
          regnerated whenever the IDL compiler itself is updated.

Sat Nov 29 11:42:48 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/TypeCodeFactory/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:

          Plugged potential memory leak in handling datatypes
          servicing recursive typecodes, with a patch modified
          from one sent in by Harvinder Sawhney
          <harvinder_sawhney@agilent.com>.

Sat Nov 29 11:13:06 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp (visit_array):

          Added logic to insert an underscore prefix in the last
          component of the scoped array name and array slice name,
          if the array is fully anonymous, meaning not in the
          case where it is a typedef of an anonymous sequence member.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ch.cpp (visit_array):

          Eliminated an unnecessary temporary local variable.

        * tests/IDL_Test/anonymous.idl:

          Cosmetic change.

Sat Nov 29 09:43:09 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp (visit_field):

          Added check to skip code generation for any kind of field except
          an anonymous array. Traits specializations are generated for
          interfaces, valuetypes and arrays. When visiting the field members
          of a struct, union or exception, we want to generate traits
          specialiations only for anonymous arrays, since all the other
          cases are handled elsewhere, at the point of declaration.

Fri Nov 28 22:46:33 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Invocation.cpp:

          When sending a AMI call, pass a oneway identifier so that the
          required infrastructure within the ORB for request buffering,
          non-blocking semantics with LF flushing strategy etc. fires.

Fri Nov 28 21:39:53 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_traits.h:

          - Added check in visit_array() to skip code generation if the node
            is imported.

          - Added methods visit_field, visit_exception, visit_structure and
            visit_union to the visitor class, to catch anonymous arrays
            declared inside IDL structs, unions and exceptions.

Fri Nov 28 17:21:28 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Cosmetic fix.

Fri Nov 28 12:53:48 2003  Huang-Ming Huang  <hh1@cse.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/ftrt_ec.html:
          Added links to MPC to clarify what it means.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/AMI_Primary_Replication_Strategy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/AMI_Primary_Replication_Strategy.h:

          Fixed warnings in SunForte 8 build.

          Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>". The above
          checkin was deadlocking the ORB.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (root_poa):

          Added a double-checked-locking in the implementation of
          root_poa. Thanks to Sebastien Lalonde for pointing this
          out. Looks like the intial authors thought that users wouldn't
          call resolve_initial_references () from multiple threads.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FtRtEvent/EventChannel/FT_ProxyAdmin_T.cpp:
          Added missing const qualifiers to fix errors in the SunForte 8 build

Thu Nov 27 15:44:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_tmplinst.cpp:
          Added fix for compilation on AIX. Thanks to Chris Sontag
          <sontag@stsci.edu> for reporting this and testing this fix.

        * tao/RTPortableServer/Makefile:
          Moved -lTAO -lACE to after the other libs in ACE_SHLIBS.

Wed Nov 26 21:54:59 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp (visit_array):

          Added missing code to mark node as visited to prevent
          repeated code generation, for example if the array is
          typedef'd, we want to prevent the underlying type from
          generating the same code when it is visited again.

Wed Nov 26 19:15:11 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Fault_Tolerance.dsp:

          Added missing libraries for linking.

        * tests/AMI/ami_test.idl:
        * tests/AMI/ami_test_i.cpp:
        * tests/AMI/ami_test_i.h:

          Added an operation to the IDL file, and to the implementation
          class, that contains an INOUT parameter. No call is made to
          this operation by the client, it is there to catch a
          possible recurrence of a bug recently fixed, in which
          incorrect code was generated for INOUT args in sendc-*
          operations.

Wed Nov 26 16:29:13 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:

          Cosmetic changes.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_traits.h:

          Added code generation for a declaration of the TAO::Array_Traits
          template specialization implemented in the *C.i file. This
          is apparently required by BCB6 when inlining is turned off,
          since the memory management methods in the traits class are
          needed by the *S.cpp file, and *C.i is not included in *C.h.
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for
          reporting the problem.

Tue Nov 25 21:17:58 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sunsoft.cpp:

          Changed code generation for the literal on the rhs of an

          ACE_UINT64_LITERAL instead of a letter suffix. Thanks to

Tue Nov 25 20:01:39 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:

          Lots of libraries depend on CosNaming. CosNaming depends on
          corba_messaging. This means that most of the orbsvcs cannot be
          built without corba_messaging.

Tue Nov 25 18:17:55 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * utils/wxNamingViewer/wxBindNewContext.cpp: Updated this file to

          - wxBindNewContext.cpp:110, add a # in front of endif

          - wxBindNewContext.cpp: 113 - 119, remove duplicate definition of
            WxBindNewContext constructor.

        * tao/PortableServer/POA.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/POA.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/POA.i:

          Calling servant_to_reference () from multiple threads from an
          application could lead to race conditions. This checkin prevents
          this race condition by adding a lock. We have also added a
          method servant_to_reference_i () which does the bulk of the
          work. Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> for
          proposing this fix.

        * tests/Servant_To_Reference_Test:

          A new test to check for race conditions.

        * tests/Makefile:

          Added Servant_To_Reference_Test into the daily builds.

Tue Nov 25 14:03:48 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNaming.mpc:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (compute_full_name):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/amh_si.cpp (gen_skel_helper):

          Fixed long-standing problems with code that was hanging on
          to memory owned by ACE_CStrings. These problems show themselves
          only intermittently, which is why they weren't fixed long ago.
          Thanks to Malcolm McRoberts <mmcroberts@ideorlando.org> for
          reporting the problem and providing helpful feedback, since it
          was so hard to reproduce.

Tue Nov 25 09:56:58 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/DLL_ORB/Makefile.Test_Client_Module:

          No need to compile and link in the skeleton files into the
          library. This is counter productive since the skeleton files
          bring in some symbols that are not completly resolved during
          loading time.

          This is just part of the problem that prevents the test from
          running in the daily builds.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Makefile:

          Fixed a small typo that caused the Makefile not to build any of

          caused when Naming_Service wasn't built.

Tue Nov 25 05:25:58 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Added missing dependency target for CosNaming to cause Svc_Util
          to be built.  This should fix a build error occurring when only
          CosNaming is Specified in TAO_ORBSVCS.  Also, fixed a typo in
          one of the dependency lists and added comments on how it how all
          works.

Mon Nov 24 20:02:44 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/ttest_export.h:

Mon Nov 24 17:29:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Uncommented out the dependency on $(TAO_IDL_DEP) for the %C.h
          target, and instead added a $(TAO_IDL_DEP) target to
          $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU that emits an
          error if the $(TAO_IDL_DEP) doesn't exist.  Thanks to Carlos for
          motivating this and suggesting the use of /bin/false to force
          make to see the error.

Mon Nov 24 11:31:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Reorganized in order to support parallel builds by removing
          .NOTPARALLEL target and code that called this Makefile
          recursively.  Instead, I've added a pattern target that invokes
          the submakefiles in parallel, and a set of targets to handle the
          inter-library dependencies.

          Keith Nicewarner for providing this patch.

Sun Nov 23 22:53:58 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBA_includeC.h:

          Removed the inclusion of the inlined files since they are are
          not required. Thanks to Don for catching the problem.

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Removed $(IDL_EXT) from SUFFIXES, and set SUFFIXES to null,
          which turns off all the implicit rules--we only want our
          explicit rules to fire.  Added the IDL generated files to
          .PRECIOUS:, since this seems to be done all over in individual
          Makefiles.  This means that these files won't be deleted if make
          is interrupted--but since they are cheap, maybe they should be.
          Commented out the $(TAO_IDL_DEP) dependency from rule that
          invokes the tao_idl compiler.  If the compiler either hasn't
          been built or can't be found, this dependency produces a cryptic
          errors like: "no rule to build xC.h needed by xC.cpp," instead
          of the more useful, "tao_idl not found."

        * examples/Simple/time-date/Makefile:
          Removed $(SHLIB) from the dependency list for the server
          target.  It isn't needed and wouldn't work like this anyway, if
          you want a library, add it to LDLIBS.  Removed the empty BIN:
          target.

        * examples/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Makefile:
          Changed IDL_FILES from NavWeap to ../NavWeap so it could be
          found, and removed unneeded IDL variables.  Removed include
          rules.bin.GNU since we aren't define our own targets, as well as
          the realclean and .NOTPARALLEL targets (parallelism works now),
          and the NavWeapC.h: target that invoke the tao_idl compiler.  Also,
          added link lines to each of the targets since the BIN rule no
          longer adds all the dependencies as objects via the $^
          variable--which is what made it impossible to have BIN targets
          depend on LIB or IDL targets and broke parallelism.  BIN no
          longer does that, see the ACE ChangeLog entry with the same tag
          for an explaination.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makefile:
          Added -lTTest to LDLIBS and removed the BIN target dependencies
          that are no longer needed.

        * tests/Object_Loader/Makefile:
          Added -lTest_DLL to LDLIBS.

        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBA_include.pidl:
        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBA_includeC.h:

          New files, a .pidl which only includes RTCORBA.pidl, and the
          stub header file generated from it, hand-crafted to include
          RTCORBA.h instead of RTCORBAC.h. This pair of files allows
          applications to include RTCORBA.pidl in their IDL files by
          including RTCORBA_include.pidl instead and let the IDL compiler
          automatically include  RTCORBA_includeC.h in the associated
          generated file, thus avoiding the error of including RTCORBAC.h
          directly.

        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBA.mpc:

          Added RTCORBA_includeC.h to the header file list.

          since changes above now make it unnecessary.

Sun Nov 23 17:48:09 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (compute_full_name):

          Added a copy operation to the char* return value since it
          is owned by a locally created ACE_CString. Even though
          this copy operation is necessary, its omission does not always
          show up as a problem. Thanks to Malcolm McRoberts
          <mmcroberts@ideorlando.org> for pointing out a case and a
          platform where it does.

          Made the IDL command line options of stub and skeleton
          projects the same (both sets of export macro and include
          directives in both projects) so the 2nd execution of the

        * utils/wxNamingViewer/wxViewIORDialog.cpp:
          Updated for linux, gcc, latest ACE/TAO and wxWindows 2.4.2. For
          linux, the wxNamingViewer.wxr file is no longer used, and the
          dialog components are created  inline. A future change should
          incorporate wxWindow's new XML-based resource system.

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Added IDL_SRC and IDL_OBJ variables.  If you define IDL_SRC in
          your Makefile to be the name of an IDL file (without .idl),
          these variables will automatically contain a list of
          corresponding *.C.h and *S.h, and *C.o and *S.o files
          respectively.  In a related ACE ChangeLog entry with the same
          ChangeLogTag, $(IDL_SRC) was added as a target dependant on the
          IDL_FILES, so if these files are modified, the IDL_SRC will be
          automatically regenerated.  Also, the same ChangeLog entry
          mentioned that $(IDL_SRC) is now alway listed as the first
          dependency in the BUILD variable, so it will alway be generated
          first an no longer constitute a problem for parallel builds.
          Makefiles need do no more than define IDL_FILES and use IDL_SRC
          and IDL_OBJS for this to work.

          targets as they are no longer needed.  These instances of
          IDL_SRC did not include the .cpp extention.  All other instances
          in TAO include the .cpp extention.

          single file and automatically handles conditional compiles based
          on requirements list passed as a list assigned to
          REQUIRED_COMPONENTS.  Updated dependencies.

        * tests/UNKNOWN_Exception/server.dsp:

          Removed generation of explicit template instantiation of

          basic types. Also removed generation of explicit template

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Client_Adapter_Impl.cpp:
        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Client_Adapter_Impl.h:

          Added TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA around create_operation_list.

        * tao/orbconf.h:
        * rules.tao.GNU:

          Nowhere in the CORBA spec does it say that messaging and
          RTCORBA needs to disabled when minimum corba is enabled. It has
          been a TAO artifact from legacy code. This prevented users from
          using RTCORBA in minimum_corba mode, which IMHO is insane to say
          the least. I am sure Bill Beckwith would support my argument:-)

          Just enabled RTCORBA and messaging in minimum_corba builds.

        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBA.cpp:
        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBA.h:

          Set the #defined  properly.

        * tests/RTCORBA/Thread_Pool/Makefile:

          These tests specifically use the minimum_poa features. So
          prevented these tests from compiling in minimum_corba builds.

        * tao/Valuetype/AbstractBase.inl:
        * tao/Valuetype/AbstractBase_T.cpp (unchecked_narrow):

          Removed _downcast() and _unchecked_narrow() methods. The
          second has been removed from TAO entirely, replace with
          dynamic_cast<>, while the first was added to the original
          implementation of abstract interfaces but, in hindsight
          seems not to be need. Thanks to George Edwards
          <edwardsgt@vanderbilt.edu> for his advice on this last item.

        * tao/Valuetype/TAO_Valuetype.dsp:

          Added missing files AbstractBase_T.h and AbstractBase_T.cpp
          to the project.

        * tao/Valuetype/ValueBase.h:

          Removed no-op inline remanat of _tao_obv_narrow(), that was
          only waiting for regeration of code within the TAO libraries
          to be removed.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_component/component_ch.cpp:

          Removed overlooked code generation of _unchecked_narrow()
          and _tao_class_id, both of which have been already removed
          from interface code generation.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_constant/constant_ch.cpp:

          Added missing 'static' qualifier to code generation for a
          constant inside an interface or a valuetype.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_cs.cpp:

          Cosmetic changes to comments in source code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:

          Removed code generation for _downcast() and _tao_obv_narrow()
          for abstract interfaces. Also removed methods (no longer used)
          that generated _unchecked_narrow() for concrete and abstract
          interfaces.

        * tao/PortableServer/ImR_LocatorC.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/ImR_Locator.pidl:

          Removed redundant explicit template instantiations. This should
          be a temporary workaround. Eventually, the generated file will
          work as is.

Thu Nov 20 11:04:09 2003  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ORB.dsp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FTORB_Utils.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ClientORB.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FT_ServerORB.dsp:
          New shared libraries.

        * TAOACE.dsw:
          Include above changes in dsw
          Working on VC6 build errors in scoreboard.


Thu Nov 20 15:39:44 2003  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * TAOACE.dsw:

          Added dependency on Messaging to CosNaming to hopefully fix new

Wed Nov 19 19:43:15 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/DomainC.cpp:

          Cosmetic changes, to keep line lengths under 80 characters.

        * tao/ORB.cpp:

          Changed the exception thrown by create_operation_list() to
          INTF_REPOS, since we are call IFR_Client in this function.
          Also added .inout() to a couple uses of String_var.

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Client_Adapter_Impl.cpp (create_operation_list):

          Plugged memory leak, made changes to conform to the ACE style
          guidelines, and several other changes to clean up the code.

Wed Nov 19 19:24:50 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp:

          Fixed a warning. Probably this would be millionth time in the
          history of ACE+TAO that we fix a warning, which is basically
          a .in () for a _var.

Wed Nov 19 17:39:56 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:

          Changed generated code for constants defined in a module to be
          inlined by default, and added command line option -Guc to
          uninline such generated code, for use with compiler that have
          a problem with such things when using pre-compiled headers.
          Also updated usage message to reflect the command line option
          change. Removed the option -Gic to make the generated code
          inline, since it is now redundant.

        * docs/compiler.html:
        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

          Updated the IDL compiler options table and the releasenotes
          with the changes above.

Wed Nov 19 13:51:18 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Any_Special_Impl_T.cpp (insert):

          Eliminated a memory leak (TypeCode copy not released) when
          inserting a string into an Any.

        * tao/DynamicAny/DynAny_i.cpp:

        * tao/DynamicAny/DynStruct_i.cpp:
        * tao/DynamicAny/DynUnion_i.cpp:

          Eliminated memory leaks (ACE_Message_Block copy not released) that
          occur when an Any of known type is used to create or assign to a
          Dynamic Any. Such Anys do not contain their value encoded in a
          CDR stream as Anys of unknown type do. However, all of TAO's
          interpretive (de)marshaling code assumes the latter so, if the
          Any's type is known, it must be marshaled into a CDR stream
          before it can be processed by Dynamic Any code. In taking this
          step, we were leaving an extra copy of a message block lying
          around. Thanks to Harvinder Sawhney <harvinder_sawhney@agilent.com>
          for pointing out the leaks. Also made cosmetic changes to keep
          line lengths under 80 characters.

        * orbsvcs/Concurrency_Service/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Makefile:

          Added messaging library. This is not sufficient. We need to make
          a check whether messaging is on or not. I just wanted to fix
          this before I went to bed.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_TargetCredentials.cpp:

          Fixed an unused variable warning.

        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/Makefile.LoadManager:

          Fixed brain damaged way of doing things. Checks for whether
          certain options have been turned on or off made sure that they
          would never be built.

Tue Nov 18 12:03:11 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          usage.

Tue Nov 18 13:59:11 2003  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (resolve_service):

          Remove the check for an environment property defining the IOR of one
          of the four 'known' services.

          (resolve_initial_references):

          Check instead for an environment property in the form <name>IOR after
          checking the IOR table (where name is any name). This fixes bug
          #1334.

          (create_operation_list):
          Added this method. Delegates to TAO_IFR_Client_Adapter (see below).

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_removing_visitor.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_removing_visitor.h:

          Added visit_root method. This fixes bug #1331.

        * tao/DynamicAny/DynUnion_i.cpp (to_any):

          Check if union is empty, i.e. check if it has an active member,
          before adding member_ to the CDR Stream. This fixes bug #1636.

          (set_from_any):

          Strip alias from type code. This fixes bug #1639.

          If no type information is given in the CDR encoding, as indicated
          by the <value-tag>, then use the repository id parameter instead.
          This fixes bug #1629.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typedef/typedef_ci.cpp (visit_array):

          Fix check for definition in another file. This fixes bug #1628.

        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.cpp (open):

          Allow additional -ORBEndpoint value(s) to be specified as the
          environment property TAO_ORBENDPOINT. This fixes bug #1627.

Tue Nov 18 07:46:30 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/FT_ORB_Utils_export.h:

          Removed the pragma message.

Tue Nov 18 05:12:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Made assignments to ACE_MAKE_OPTIONS for each TAO specific make
          flag, e.g., ami, rt_corba, etc. Added -I$(TAO_ROOT) to INCLDIRS
          and -L$(TAO_ROOT)/tao to LDFLAGS which keeps us from having to
          include taoconfig.mk.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTCosScheduling:
          Heavily modified this Makefile to use the new makefile scheme,
          including setting ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE = $(TAO_ROOT)/rules.tao.GNU
          and REQUIRED_COMPONENTS = interceptors rt_corba RTCosScheduling
          before including include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU.  Assuming
          this worksout okay, we should be able to use this as a model for
          modifying the MPC templates.

Mon Nov 17 20:42:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/fault_tol_export.h:

          Reverted the change to fault_tol_export.h. This was creating
          problems with g++, especially the pragma messages. This
          reversion just removes those messages.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_Entry_T.h:
          Build error: TAO_SYNCH_MUTEX undefined.  Add included to define it.

Mon Nov 17 21:43:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Trading.mpc:
          Removed dynamicflags and idlflags because this test doesn't use them.
          This resulted in hundreds of errors in the MinGW build

Mon Nov 17 21:35:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/RTCORBA/Diffserv/client.cpp:
        * tests/RTCORBA/Diffserv/Custom_Network_Priority_Mapping.cpp:

Mon Nov 17 17:00:03 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Test_Filter/Makefile.bor:
          Added ValueType library

Mon Nov 17 10:04:56 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ci.cpp:

          For generation of inline array traits methods, changed
          ACE_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION to
          ACE_TEMPLATE_METHOD_SPECIALIZATION.

Sun Nov 16 22:47:53 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:

          Fixed a compile error due to wrong exception macro usage.

Sun Nov 16 18:04:05 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/operation_details.i:

          Removed 'return' from the last line of two methods returning void.

Sun Nov 16 16:49:33 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/FT_Service_Callbacks.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:

          Fix for [BUG 1384]. Please see

          http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1384

          for details. The crux of the problem is whether the FTORB
          infrastructure should do a reinvocation when it receives a
          TRANSIENT over the wire. Opinions were widely different on
          this. We finally took the opinion of Jon Biggar who said this
          was okay.

Sun Nov 16 12:40:15 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/Bug_1559/interceptors.cpp:

          In receive_request_service_context (), return if we receive a
          shutdown call. If not the test will not shutdwon cleanly.

Sun Nov 16 12:32:02 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/operation_details.h:
        * tao/operation_details.i:

          Added two new methods reset_request_service_info () and
          reset_reply_service_info () which resets the buffer within the
          underlying service context list.

        * tao/Invocation_Adapter.cpp:

          If the call on a traget object returned a
          TAO::TAO_INVOKE_RESTART, reset the buffer of the service context
          list cached within the operation_details before restarting the
          invocation on a new target. This should fix [BUG1559].

        * tao/Sequence.cpp:
        * tao/Sequence.h:
        * tao/Sequence_T.cpp:

          The _dellocate_buffer () implementations just released the
          buffer and set the buffer to be null. The length_, release_ and
          maximum_ (not for bounded sequences) need to be reset too. If
          not the following code fragment could crash

          some_sequence._deallocate_buffer ();
          some_sequence[i].something ();

        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Synch_Invocation.h:

          Cosmetic fixes like adding more comments, adding preconditions
          and postconditions for a few calls etc.

Sun Nov 16 18:33:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:
          Removed #include OS.h and added os_stdio.h"

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.CosNotification:
          Moved $(IDL_SRC) in front of $(addsuffix .cpp,$(FILES)) in LSRC
          to fix dependencies, by requiring them to be build first.
          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RTCosScheduling/RTCosScheduling_ClientScheduler_i.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_errno.h and OS_NS_stdio.h.

        * tao/Valuetype/Sequence_T.inl:
          Added #include Log_Msg.h to pick up ACE_ASSERT.

Sun Nov 16 10:03:59 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

Sat Nov 15 16:18:29 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/DynamicAny/DynEnum_i.cpp:
        * tao/DynamicAny/DynUnion_i.cpp:

          Added checks for 0 ACE_Message_Block return value from call to
          _tao_get_cdr() on an Any, and alternate method of extraction
          if the message block is 0. This closes [BUGID:1645].

Sat Nov 15 14:33:39 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_constant/constant_ch.cpp:

          Replaced a generated 'extern' with 'TAO_NAMESPACE_STORAGE_CLASS'
          to automatically include the export macro, if any. Thanks to
          Mike Hepburn <mike@anvil.com> for rerorting the problem.

Fri Nov 14 04:53:28 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/RTScheduling/Scheduling_Interceptor/Makefile:
          Moved the testC.o and testS.o objects in from of the
          test_client.o and test_server.o objects in the CLIENT_OBJS and
          SERVER_OBJS lists to force them to get created first.

Fri Nov 14 03:47:33 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * orbsvcs/examples/RtEC/Kokyu/Makefile:
          Only define BIN target and build if RTKokyuEvent and CosNaming
          have been built.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTKokyuEvent:

        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Invocation_Adapter.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Added new file, Asynch_Invocation_Adapter.inl, and added invoke
          method that matches the one in the base class that had been
          hidden by the new one with different parameters.

Thu Nov 13 21:02:31 2003  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTCosScheduling:
          Moved the LIB and SHLIB assignments up before wrapper_macros.GNU
          so that it can do it's magic and decide which gets built.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Activator_i.cpp (init):
          Changed ACE_THROW to ACE_THROW_RETURN to fix compile error.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Locator_i.cpp (unregister_activator):
          Changed ACE_ENV_ARG_DECL to ACE_ENV_ARG_DECL_NOT_USED to fix
          compile warning about unused variable.

Wed Nov 12 07:40:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/Kokyu_dsrt_schedulers/Makefile:
          Removed unused DIRS variable.

        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/Makefile.LoadManager:
        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/Makefile.LoadMonitor:
          Moved the component test and BIN variable assignment to the two
          Load* makefiles and added the use of BIN_UNCHECKED variable so
          that it will get cleaned up.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Removed the ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS_realclean target.  It's unneeded
          and caused the ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS.list to get deleted
          immediately during realclean, even though it was needed for
          testing later.  This is no longer a problem since we now clean
          the *_UNCHECKED targets by default.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTCosScheduling:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RT_Notification:
          Removed the compclean targets--they don't belong here, since
          they would remove the ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS.list file which isn't
          what they should be doing.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTCosScheduling:
        * orbsvcs/tests/RTCosScheduling/Makefile.commonlib:
          Added use of *_UNCHECKED variables.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_constant/constant_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_constant/constant_cs.cpp:

          Restored the functionality of the command line option -Gic to
          generate the value assignment of constants declared in a
          namespace (IDL module) in the *C.h file. This provides
          application developers with a way to use such constants by
          name in application code, as array bounds and such. Thanks to
          Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@atdesk.com> for pointing out the
          problem.

Tue Nov 11 11:03:09 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

Mon Nov 10 16:44:43 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/DynamicInterface/Request.cpp (poll_response):

          Reverted the return value to be CORBA::Request::response_recieved_,
          but also added a call to perform_work() with a timeout of 0, if
          response_received_ is false, so that, in the single-threaded
          case, the application doesn't starve the ORB (and prevent the
          appearance of the response). Thanks to David Faure <faure@kde.org>
          for reporting the problem, and to Bala Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> for his help with the fix.

          Removed #include streams.h and changed ostream& << calls to use
          new dump_i() method.  Removing streams.h will reduce compile
          times and footprint and since dump calls are for debugging, they
          won't effect performance.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_constant/constant_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_constant/constant_cs.cpp:

          Changed code generation for constants defined in a module
          to use 'extern' in the *C.h file and assign the value in
          the *C.cpp file. Assigning the value of such constants in
          the header file was causing a problem with pre-compiled
          headers on BCB. Thanks to Mike Hepburn <mike@anvil.com> for
          reporting the problem.

          Added server->activator hash map and renamed the existing hash map.
        Also removed unnecessary typedefs for entry and iterator.

          Added the ability to safely unregister an activator, although it
        is really untested, as there is no way to cleanly shutdown except
        when run as an nt service.

          Many tao_imr commands now seem to work. I don't know of any problems,
        but many combinations are untested.

          Updated idl exception specifications because many operations should
        throw NotFound when an activator can't be found for a server, and
        reregister_server() can throw AlreadyRegistered if you try to register
        with a different activator.

        Removed unused template files from tao/PortableServer, and
          updated instructions to use -Sc.

          Changed the text of some output messages to remove
        the use of Error: which was incorrectly showing up as
        errors during implrepo run_test.pl's
          Updated to support passing of persisted servers back
        to the locator when the activator registers.

          Updated to support passing of persisted servers back
        to the locator when the activator registers.

        Removed unused tao/PortableServer/ImR_Activator*.*

        Support for ImR as NT Services.

        Updated run_test.pl for the main ImplRepo tests.

        Updated all -?/-h options for command line programs.

        Commented out include of missing file in corba.h

          New files that were created using the new IDL compiler
          option, that puts the Any operators in a seperate file.  This
          is just a test. If this gives good wins, we can go ahead fix all
          the generated code in $TAO_ROOT/tao to maintain the Any's in a
          seperate file. This can be used by the application by just
          including the header.

          Added a new IDL compiler option (intended for use on TAO
          .pidl files only) and associated mechanism to generate
          Any operators into a separate set of .h and .cpp files.
          This option will result in footprint reduction in most,
          if not all, application programs that link to TAO.

        * tao/Object_KeyC.cpp:
        * tao/Object_KeyC.h:

          Added another static method, demarshal_key (), which works more
          or less like extraction operator >>, but with a difference. We
          don't check for locked_data_blocks () within the resource
          factory while trying to extract the key.

          Why do we need all this? Please see bugzilla entry [BUGID 1616]
          for details. To make the long story short, under certain
          configurations (ie. when we set the locks on the buffer
          allocator to null), we tend to copy the object key. Further we
          tend to make copies over and over again when writing the GIOP
          header.

          This new method, by not checking for the locked datablocks
          circumvents the copying for single threaded builds. We have to
          wait and see how much of an improvement does this get us.

          There is some code duplication between this method and the new
          static method. This is okay. The extraction operators are
          generated by the IDL compiler. Trying to share code would make
          the maintenance of this generated code a nightmare.

        * tao/Profile.cpp:

          Use the new method added instead of the extraction operator.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/README:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/receiver.cpp:

          Recorded the rate at which frames are received for every sec
          after the first frame is received in the Stats.dat file.

        * tao/Any_Unknown_IDL_Type.cpp:

          The constructor tried to duplicate the message block
          irresepctive of where it came from. To make the long story
          short, it is quite possible that the message block that this
          class gets could be from the stack and blind duplicate () would
          lead to crashes. If you don't believe me, please see the failure
          of the DII test in the daily builds.

          This started showing up after the optimizations to the critical
          path outlined in

        * tao/Synch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:

          Removed a debug statement which was a waste.

        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Invocation.cpp:

          Cosmetic changes.

        * ChangeLog:

          Removed a long listing of Makefile whose dependencies were
          updated. They have served no purpose AFAIK other than blowing up
          the size of ChangeLogs. Just a regexp indicating that the
          Makefile's dependencies were updated should be sufficient.

        This checkin is about an optimization and definitely not for the
        weak hearted :-)! All this jugglery is for getting rid of one
        allocation along the critical path. Not sure how much would this
        fetch us, but nevertheless an useful optimization.

        A quick brief. In older versions of TAO, the client thread used to
        create a output CDR on the TSS and use that for marshalling data
        and sending data which was neat. But during the reply, we used to
        create an InputCDR on the global memory since the thread reading
        the reply message could be different from the thread to whom the
        reply belongs to. If you want to know why, look for documentation
        of TAO's LF. After we worked on BUG 1369, we got a few advantages
        and this  optimization cashed in on that.

        Refactoring the generated code allowed us to move the CDR stream
        inside the transport, to be more specific inside the GIOP
        objects. This was also right, since the CDR's are tied to
        GIOP. But this gave rise to a problem. We could not use the TSS
        anymore since multiple threads could share the same transport (one
        after another). Hence we used the global memory pool (different
        from the global heap) to allocate the CDR and this is a one time
        activity cached inside the transport. All threads can infact use
        the same chunk of memory. That was done when we merged the branch
        for fixes from 1369. Since the transports are anyway on a per-lane
        basis RTCORBA wouldn't be affected at all.

        This checkin broke another barrier, ie. the allocation required
        while getting the replies. The thread collecting the reply can
        read the messages on its stack and copy the messages to the stack
        of another thread which is expecting a reply. Therefore we now
        require no allocations but for a copy.

        All the above are valid for messages of decent size. If the
        messages are big we have to hit the global memory. What are the
        end results?

        - TAO now does not do any allocation along the outgoing request
          path.

        - It doesn't do any allocation along the reply collection path
          even in MT scenarios for decent sized messages and when the
          network is behaving well (ie. when there is no IP
          fragmentation).

        We were also helped by an optimization that was added in ACE
        yesterday to the CDR streams. We have to wait and see how much
        does this checkin buys us in terms of performance. Anyway, this
        documentation should be useful for others.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp (process_reply_message):

          Construct the CDR stream and use that CDR to dispatch the
          reply. Now the reply dispatch is done by the GIOP objects.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_10.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_12.cpp:

          No need to do any exchange CDR blocks since things are being
          taken care elsewhere.

        * tao/Pluggable_Messaging_Utils.cpp:
        * tao/Pluggable_Messaging_Utils.h:

          Added a transport pointer to the Reply_Params object. It is
          used by the GIOP layer to dispatch the reply. Removed the
          temporary CDR that was created here.

        * tao/Synch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:

          Added a check for null CDR's in the Reply_Param's object.

        * tao/Transport.cpp: Construct the Reply_Params using the
          transport instead of the ORB_Core.


          This fixes [BUG 1615]

Fri Nov  7 02:08:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Server_Repository.cpp:
          Changed use of cerr to ACE_ERROR_RETURN.

        * performance_tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Timer.h:
          Removed #include of OS.h.

Thu Nov  6 17:58:21 2003  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/Basic.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/run_test.pl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/server.cpp:

          Changed the application controlled membership test.
          The test uses the Random load balancing strategy built in TAO
          load balancer service.

          Servers or members are added onto object groups. After
          request invocations are made, application has to delete
          those members from the object group. This is application
          controlled membership.

Thu Nov  6 14:13:46 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp:

          Fixed some ACE_CHECK_RETURN's that were trying to return -1 from
          functions that were suppoed to return pointers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Profile.cpp:

          #included "ace/OS_NS_string.h"

Thu Nov 6 14:54:42 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/README:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/sender.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/sender.cpp:

          Added command line arguments to specify local and peer
          addresses. In case of SCTP_SEQ protocol added command line
          arguments to specify secondary addresses.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Two_Stage/README:

          Updated to include info about command line arguments to specify
          local and peer addresses.

Thu Nov  6 13:17:34 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:

          If the ORB prepares to throw a COMM_FAILURE exception with
          completed_maybe, just delegate to the ORB_Core to take the right
          decision. This is required to for FT_CORBA.

Thu Nov  6 12:53:46 2003  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/examples/LoadBalancing/server.cpp:
          Added a include to OS.h to fix a compile error.

Thu Nov  6 07:04:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
          Added #include ace/os_include/os_stddef.h to get size_t

Wed Nov  5 19:19:08 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/PollableC.cpp:
        * tao/PollableC.h:
        * tao/PollableC.i:

          Regenerated the code.

        * tao/Synch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:

          Added debugging statements to indicate failure of clone_from ()
          when debugging level is cranked up.

        * tao/Remote_Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Messaging/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp (handle_timeout):

          Changed the completion status of the CORBA::TIMEOUT exception
          thrown. For example returning a completion status of
          COMPLETED_NO while timing out waiting for the reply seems brain
          dead. Further fixed the minor code to return the SEND_MINOR_CODE
          or RECV_MINOR_CODE as the case maybe.

          This fixes a problem reported by Torsten Kuepper
          <torsten.kuepper@nokia.com> [BUG 1600].

Wed Nov 5 16:03:08 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/SCTP_SEQ.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/SCTP_SEQ.cpp:

          Added the change_qos (...) method to
          TAO_AV_SCTP_SEQ_Flow_Handler in order to set the specified
          Diffserv Codepoint on the data packets sent.

Wed Nov  5 09:56:26 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (run): Removed 'int' declaration to prevent
          obscuring the 'result' variable.  The reason this is important
          is because, by obscuring the 'result' variable, the true return
          value of Reactor::handle_events() never got returned, and the
          caller (typically ORB_Core::run) couldn't tell why handle_events
          exited even though it wants to.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init): Added new option, -ORBVerboseLogging,
          to turn on the VERBOSE or VERBOSE_LITE flag in ACE_Log_Msg.
          Range of values are 0, 1, or 2 for no verbose, VERBOSE_LITE, and
          VERBOSE, respectively.

Wed Nov  5 09:21:38 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:

          Set the aggregate_seen_ bit inaddition to the union_seen_ bit.

Wed Nov  5 05:33:44 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.h:
          Removed #include of OS.h which seems to cause a problem if
          included before streams.h.  Not sure why.

        * TAO/tests/RTScheduling/VoidData/testC.cpp:
          Added #include of OS_NS_string.h.

Tue Nov  4 22:14:18 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/include/idl_global.h:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:

          Added a new bit union_seen_ to keep track of unions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

          Generate OS_NS_string.h even when you see a union.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:

          Set the union_seen_ bit within the visitor's constructor.

          Added #includes needed due to subsetting in ACE.

Tue Nov  4 21:08:53 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_argument.cpp:

          Removed the check for !dcl->imported () in the constructor
          before setting the bits. This was required to get the right
          Valuetype includes within the generated code. The inclusion is
          necessary for eventtype {} declarations to work.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_home.cpp:

          Within the constructor narrow the AST_Component to a
          be_component and call seen_in_operation (), and ACE_SET_BITS for
          further processing. This is required to generate the
          Object_Argument_T.h includes in the stub cpp file.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_arg_traits.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_arg_traits.h:

          Added two new methods visit_component () and visit_component_fwd
          () that delegates to the visit_interface () and
          visit_interface_fwd () call.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_component/component_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_component/component_cs.cpp:

          Bunch of changes to these files. The changes include

          - Generating and initializing the right collocated factory
            function pointer
          - Generating the right implementation for the setup_collocation
            () call
          - Generating the right implementation for the _narrow () call.
          - Removal of the old _unchecked_narrow () generation.
          - Removal of the tao_QueryInterface () call

          With the above changes CIAO examples seem to compile fine.

Tue Nov 04 19:36:46 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * COPYING: Modified to include CIAO in the Copyright disclaimer.
          Thanks to Roland Schimmack <SC@ProCom.de> for motivating the change.

Wed Nov  5 01:00:31 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tao/Leader_Follower.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/POA.cpp:
          Added #include of OS_NS_sys_time.h.

Tue Nov  4 17:02:39 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/TypeCodeFactory/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:

          Corrected system exception minor codes.  In particular, they
          have to be logically ORed with the standard CORBA::OMGVMCID
          constant.

Tue Nov  4 15:57:09 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (get_listen_point):

          Verify that dynamically casted TAO_IIOP_Acceptor pointer is
          non-zero before use.  Addresses potential run-time errors.

          Improved const-correctness.

        * tao/Object_Proxy_Impl.h:

          Include "tao/orbconf.h" to pull in TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA macro
          definition.  Fixes a g++ warning exhibited when "-Wundef"
          compiler flag is set.

        * tao/Typecode_Constants.cpp:

          Check if TAO_HAS_AMI_POLLER is defined before checking its
          value.  Fixes a g++ warning exhibited when "-Wundef" compiler
          flag is set.

        * tao/NVList.i:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

Tue Nov  4 16:23:35 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:

          #included the files where the contents of this file have been
          moved. This is necessary for backward compatibility. Lots of
          application code might still be using this.

        * tao/corbafwd.cpp (ACE_RCSID):

          Emptied the contents since they are no longer needed. They are
          just around for backward compatibility.

        * TAO_IDL/include/utl_string.h:
        * TAO_IDL/include/utl_strlist.h:
          Changed #include from streams.h to iosfwd.h.  This fixes the
          current compilation problems on SuSE inlined builds complaining
          about 'ceil' and 'floor' already declared in this scope.

Tue Nov  4 18:26:36 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

Mon Nov  3 22:46:31 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

          Added check for IDL exception to condition for generating
          #include of ace/OS_NS_String.h - the _downcast() method uses
          strcmp().

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

          Removed extra empty line in code generation for the interface
          constructor from Stub.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_traits.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_traits.h:

          Cosmetic changes to source code.

Mon Nov  3 04:43:43 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Makefile:
          Pass the $(MAKE) variable to the reverseclean script
          instead of "make".  This fixes problems in autobuilds that
          assign something other than "make" to the make_program
          variable.

          Removed a couple of macros for namespaces that are no longer

          There are few more macros that can go. But that is the next

        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Acceptor.h:
        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Connector.cpp:

          SCIOP URLs with comma-separated hostnames (e.g.,
          "sciop://host-a,host-b") are implemented with distinct Acceptors
          and produce separate Profiles in the SCIOR.  In contrast, SCIOP
          URLs with plus-separated hostnames (e.g.,
          "sciop://host-a+host-b") are implemented with a single Acceptor
          and produce a shared Profile in the SCIOR.  Thanks to Yamuna
          Krishnamurthy <yamuna@oomworks.com> and Craig Rodrigues
          <crodrigu@bbn.com> for identifying the previous, erroneous
          behavior in which URLs with comma-separated hostnames were
          implemented with distinct Acceptors, but produced a single,
          shared Profile, which mistakenly implied the benefits of a
          single Acceptor (i.e., SCTP failover and network path
          multiplexing.)

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:

          Added a missing break from the loop to remove trailing whitespace
          from constant strings.  The result from the missing break is that
          the string would get chopped in the middle if it had a space. Thanks
          to Onopin V. Mikhail <kool@garant.ru> for reporting the problem.

          library.

        * tests/OBV/Supports/Supports_Test_impl.cpp:

          Added tao_release() to the generated Value_Traits<> specialization,
          so the INOUT argument template helper class can release the argument
          at demarshal time with the same call for both interface and
          valuetypes. This extra method has already been added to
          CORBA::ValueBase.

          named the Cygnus Load Balancing/Monitoring Service.

          The server objects, which the LB service is trying to load
          balance is a StockFactory object. Clients make lot
          of requests to StockFactory objects, which inturn
          call a Stock object to return the stock price of
          a particular Stock symbol.

Wed Oct 29 15:03:58 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/DynamicInterface/DynamicInterface.mpc:
        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServer.mpc:

        This checkin is aimed at revamping the invocation code path
        including the generated code. The design is outlined in the
        bugzilla. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1369

        This checkin only concentrates on the stub path. During the work
        we tried addressing the following additional problems

        - Header inclusions. Now IDL compiler generates just enough
          headers for the applications. There is no need to include
          corba.h or corbafwd.h anymore.

        - Wide range of problems with PortableInterceptors. Please see the
          dependencies in the above bug list.

        - We have tried reducing the inter-header dependencies quite a
          bit within the TAO library. Other libraries need more
          work. There are more places in TAO where this can be done
          effectively. We will address all of them with time.

        - We have changed most of the tests and examples including the ORB
          services to include thelight weight headers.

        - The generated code has gone down by more than 50%
          everywhere. This work also clearly demarcates the responsibility
          of the IDL compiler from the ORB. More work is needed on the
          skeleton side.

        More gory details of the changes can be found in
        $TAO_ROOT/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-03d. The documentation for all the
        new interfaces are not complete yet. We will do them as we
        cleanup the scoreboard.

        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-03d: New changelog entry for the changes.

Tue Oct 28 12:01:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-03c: Moved a bunch of ChangeLog entries

Tue Oct 28 07:05:46 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        The following changes are designed to make profile equivalance
        checking code consistent between all pluggable protocol
        implementations.

        * tao/Profile.h (is_equivalent):

          This method is no longer virtual since it relies on template
          methods implemented by subclasses to perform pluggable
          protocol-specific profile equivalence check processing.

          (do_is_equivalent):

          New protected template method that subclasses must implement in
          order to allow pluggable protocols to apply their own definition
          of profile equivalance.

          (endpoint_count):

          Made this method const to address "discards const qualifier"
          errors.  This is now necessary since some equivalence checking
          code that calls this method has been refactored to the
          is_equivalence() method.

        * tao/Profile.cpp (is_equivalent):

          Check for a zero pointer to avoid potential a seg fault.

          Invoke the new do_is_equivalent() template method and the new
          is_equivalent_hook() hook method.

          (is_profile_equivalent_i, is_equivalent_hook):

          Renamed is_profile_equivalent_i() method to is_equivalent_hook()
          to better reflect the purpose of this method.  Note that
          is_equivalent_hook() is virtual to allow subclasses to override
          the default behavior.

          (is_equivalent_hook):

          The TAO_Unknown_Profile::is_equivalent() method does not need to
          allow some services (e.g. FT) to apply their own definition of
          profile equivalence.  Override this method so that it always
          return true.  Note that this behavior is consistent with the
          behavior that existed prior to these changes.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.h (endpoint_count):

          Now a "const" method to address "discards const qualifier"
          errors.

          (is_equivalent, do_is_equivalent):

          Renamed this public method to the new protected
          do_is_equivalent() template method.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp (is_equivalent):

          Refactored common profile equivalence checking code to the
          TAO_Profile base class.

          (do_is_equivalent):

          Moved protocol-specific profile equivalence checks to this
          template method.

          (endpoint_count):

          Now a "const" method to address "discards const qualifier"
          errors.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Secure_Invocation/server.cpp:

          Added a sanity check for properly functioning SSLIOP object
          reference equivalence checks.  Thanks to Sebastien Lalonde
          <SLalonde@interstarinc.com> for pointing out that SSLIOP object
          reference equivalence was not working properly.

        * TAOACE.dsw: Added that EventService is dependent of BiDIR GIOP
          to make sure that BiDIR GIOP is build first.
