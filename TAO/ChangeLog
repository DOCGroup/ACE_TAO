	 * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_Core.cpp: Check if the peer address is
	   set for B endpoint when initializing forward flows. If set use
	   that address to create acceptors. This case happens when no
 	   address is specified for the A endpoint.

	 * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/FlowSpec_Entry.h:
	 * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/FlowSpec_Entry.cpp: Changed the flow spec entry from
	   "Flowname\Direction\Format\Flow_Prtocol\Sender_Address" to
	   "Flowname\Direction\Format\Flow_Prtocol\Sender_Address\Receiver_Address".
	   The additonal Receiver_Address field allows the user to specify
	   the receiver address that will be used to receive the
	   data. This addition helps to solve the problem arising on a
	   multihomed host where the acceptor was by default accepting on
	   all interfaces. This was not acceptable in some cases. Hence,
	   by specifying the sender and receiver addresses explicitly only
	   the required interfaces on a multihomed host are used.

	 * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/QoS_UDP.cpp: 
	 * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/UDP.cpp:Made changes to create sockets on the
	 specified local and remote addresses to send and receive data
	 correspondingly.

	 * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/QoS_UDP.cpp: The source host and port in the
	   TSpec for setting the RSVP sending_qos were not set
	   correctly. This was fixed.

	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Connection_Manager.cpp:
	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Connection_Manager.h:
	   Added load_ep () method to read an address file (if available)
	   to get the sender and receiver endpoints for each flow that is
	   set up. The address file has entries in the format:
	   Flowname/Sender_Host:Port/Reciever_Host:Port. If the address
	   file or endpoints are not specified then the connection manager
	   uses INADDR_ANY for the endpoints.

	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Sender.h:
	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Sender.cpp:
	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Receiver.h:
	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Receiver.cpp:
	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Distributer.h:
	 * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Distributer.cpp:
	   Added additional parameter -a <address_file> to the command line
	   arguments to specify the endpoint address file from which to
	   load the flow endpoint addresses. Also, made a call to the
	   Connection_Manager::load_ep () method that reads the address
	   file and stores the endpoint addresses for each speficied flow
	   in a hash map.

Wed Feb 19 12:52:06 2003  Heather Drury  <oci@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 1.3.1 released.

Mon Feb 17 15:37:47 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tests/RTCORBA/Persistent_IOR/client.bor: Linked the client with
	  RTCORBA library to get the static constructors in so that they
	  can do its job. 

Mon Feb 17 15:26:32 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tests/RTCORBA/MT_Client_Protocol_Priority/client.conf: This file
	  missed the previous checkin somehow. Adding this file to the
	  repo. 

Mon Feb 17 09:09:54 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_IORInterceptor.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_IORInterceptor.cpp: Fixed compile error
          that was happening because the base class signature for 
          establish_components() did not match the derived class method
          signature.

Sat Feb 15 10:14:08 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Activity.h: Fixed compile errors in
          builds where exceptions have been turned off.

Fri Feb 14 21:12:22 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_module.cpp:

          Changed a misapplied static_cast to const_cast.

Fri Feb 14 18:27:09 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_decl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_module.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_module.h:

          Fixes for an error in IDL_Test, where recent changes to the
          IDL compiler induced an error in typeprefix handling, and
          a bug reported by Will Christhof <Will.Christhof@krones.de>
          in #pragma prefix handling.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp:

          Cosmetic fix.

        * tests/IDL_Test/main.cpp:

          Changed error reporting and handling to allow multiple
          errors to be reported in one run, and to allow the ORB
          and POA to clean up at exit whether there have been errors
          or not.

Fri Feb 14 14:37:55 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_predefined_type.cpp (compute_repoID):

          Fixed function to catch a reference to CORBA::Object
          in an IDL file. The repository ID must be handled as
          a special case, since this node type is not looked up
          in the AST.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_defn.cpp:

          Fixed incorrect typecode generation for members of type
          CORBA::Object. Thanks to Ferran Boladeres Salvadó <bds@iis.fhg.de>
          for sending in the example code that uncovered the bug.

Fri Feb 14 18:39:01 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * tao/RTCORBA/RT_ORBInitializer.cpp:
          If you do:
          ACE_DEBUG((LM_DEBUG, "%p" ));
          to print errno, then that is wrong and will crash.

          You need to do:
          ACE_DEBUG((LM_DEBUG, "%p", "somestring ));
          I've changed things to be consistent:
          ACE_DEBUG((LM_DEBUG, "errno: %d %m", errno));

Fri Feb 14 09:12:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RTCORBA/MT_Client_Protocol_Priority/client.conf: New file
          with the scheduling policy information for the client.

        * tests/RTCORBA/MT_Client_Protocol_Priority/server.conf: Added the
          scheduling policy information for the server.

        * tests/RTCORBA/MT_Client_Protocol_Priority/run_test.pl: Sript now
          use the above configuration files when running the test.

        * tests/RTCORBA/MT_Client_Protocol_Priority/svc.conf: Removed from
          the repository.

Fri Feb 14 08:35:14 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Activity.cpp: Fixed compile errors in
          builds where exceptions have turned off. Thanks to Pradeep Gore
          for sending the patches.

Fri Feb 14 12:02:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * utils/catior/Makefile.bor:
          Fixed this BCB makefile

Thu Feb 13 19:30:55 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RTCORBA/Persistent_IOR/Makefile: Linked the client with
          RTCORBA library.

Thu Feb 13 15:15:29 2003  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>

        * tao/MCAST_Parser.cpp (multicast_query):
          Modified the diagnostic message that Craig added with the
          changelog entry

          Wed Feb 12 00:45:04 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

          to reflect the actual service name instead of being NameService
          always. Added a service_name check to print out the NameService
          related debugging message if it is indeed NameService.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/tao_imr_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Activator_i.cpp:
          A change which I did a while ago seemed to be missing. Nanbor
          applied the relevant fixes for Windows. Removing the ifdefs
          around the same code so that even for non-windows, the whole
          hostname including the domain is used.


Thu Feb 13 17:45:35 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * utils/catior/Makefile: Do not build if RTCORBA is turned off.

Thu Feb 13 17:41:37 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RTCORBA/Profile_And_Endpoint_Selection/svc.conf: Added the
          scheduling policy to the configuration file.

Thu Feb 13 16:35:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Exposed_Policies/svc.conf: Configuration file for
          scheduling policy.

Thu Feb 13 13:32:50 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * utils/catior/catior.dsp: Fixed the debug and release configurations.

Thu Feb 13 14:21:43 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp: Fixed warnings and errors on various
          platforms.

Thu Feb 13 12:43:27 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Periodic_Task.h:
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Thread_Task.cpp:
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Thread_Task.h:
          Added missing code to convert CORBA priority to native priority
          when activating the thread task.

          Made the following changes to get the example running in the
          autobuilds:
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/run_test.pl:
          This runs a simple test of the activity example. This test is
          meant to be run in non-root mode.
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Activity.cpp:
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/Activity.h:
          - Added code to obtain the Priority Mapping Manager.
          - Added a "-Started_Flag <file_name> " option. When an activity instance
          completes its setup, it generates a file to signal the perl
          script that it has finished initialization.
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/README:
          Added a new section on the new command-line option.
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/server.conf:
        * examples/RTCORBA/Activity/client.conf:
          These conf files are read by run_test.pl to make a sanity check
          on the activity program.

Thu Feb 13 10:30:56 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_module.cpp:

          Fixed an error in comparing the prefixes of a module and a previous
          opening of that module. The error appears only when the previous
          module opening is in an included IDL file, and the IDL compiler
          is executed from a subdirectory of the one where the IDL files
          are located. Thanks to Will Christof <Will.Christof@krones.de>
          for reporting the bug and for providing the example IDL files and
          build conditions. This closes [BUGID:1442].

Wed Feb 12 14:58:46 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp: Methods tear_listen_point_list () and
          get_listen_point () accessed the connection_handler without any
          protection and violated the protocol that was set in pre-1.2
          timeframe.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Transport.cpp: Same changes as
          above. This code needs refactoring.

        * tao/Transport.h: Cosmetic fix.

Wed Feb 12 12:32:57 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RTCORBA/Client_Protocol/svc.conf:

        * tests/RTCORBA/Server_Protocol/server_reverse_nt.conf:
        * tests/RTCORBA/Server_Protocol/server_shmiop.conf:
        * tests/RTCORBA/Server_Protocol/server_uiop.conf:  Added
          scheduling policy information to the above configuration
          files. This should fix the problems that shows up in our daily
          builds.

Wed Feb 12 12:14:13 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp: Fixed a warning in g++ builds.

Wed Feb 12 00:45:04 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * tao/MCAST_Paser.cpp: Add improved diagnostic message when
          locating NameService via multicast fails.

Wed Feb 12 00:19:58 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * tao/RTCORBA/Linear_Priority_Mapping.cpp (to_CORBA):
          Unconditionally display error message upon priority mapping failure.
        * tao/RTCORBA/RT_Protocol_Hooks.cpp: Display errno value and message
          if setting the native thread priority fails.
        * tao/RTCORBA/RT_ORBInitiializer.h:
          Create a new class member variable sched_policy_flags_.
          The value of sched_policy_flags_ is a bitmask value that can be one of
          THR_SCHED_RR, THR_SCHED_FIFO, THR_SCHED_DEFAULT, etc.
          sched_policy_flags_ value is stored in the
          TAO_ORB_Core TAO_ORB_Parameters structure.
          In TAO_Thread_Lane::create_dynamic_threads(), the sched_policy_flags_
          is passed to the ACE_Task_Base::activate() call for creating new
          threads for a RTCORBA thread pool.

          sched_policy_ is an integer value that can be one of
          ACE_SCHED_RR, ACE_SCHED_FIFO, ACE_SCHED_OTHER, etc.  This value
          can be passed directly to the newly modified ACE_OS::thr_setpriority()
          call.  For POSIX pthreads, this value maps directly to the
          policy parameter of the pthread_setschedparam() call.
          ACE_SCHED_* values can also be passed directly to ACE_Sched_Params
          for determining the minimum and maximum priority value for a particular
          policy.

        * tao/RTCORBA/RT_ORBInitiializer.cpp:
          Change all assignments of sched_policy_ variable to use
          ACE_SCHED_* values and not THR_SCHED_* values.
          In the TAO_RT_ORBInitializer constructor, set sched_policy_flags_
          to the appropriate THR_SCHED_* values depending on what ACE_SCHED_*
          value is specified.

          In TAO_RT_ORBInitializer::pre_init(), pass sched_policy_flags_
          to orb_core()->orb_params()->sched_policy(), since this value
          will be later used in the activate() call in
          TAO_Thread_Lane::create_dynamic_threads().

          At the end of TAO_RT_ORBInitializer::pre_init(), set the policy
          of the ACE_Thread::self() to the policy specified by -ORBSchedPolicy, and
          set the priority of ACE_Thread::self() to the lowest priority
          of the specified policy.  If this is not done, then errors will
          occur on Linux, because the default policy in ACE_OS::thr_setprio()
          is 0 (which maps to SCHED_OTHER), which will cause strange errors
          when the scheduling policy is set to something else, like SCHED_RR.

          Since the return value of ACE_OS::thr_getprio() can be invalid for
          a given policy, ie. 0 is valid for SCHED_OTHER, but invalid for
          SCHED_RR, I then decided to set the priority to the minimum
          priority of the policy/scheduling class.

          In addition, in RTPortableServer's
          TAO_RT_Servant_Dispatcher::post_invoke() function, the priority
          of the thread will be reset to what it was before the invocation.
          This means that on platforms which use pthread_setschedparam(),
          the initial priority and policy of the thread need to be
          set to acceptable initial values, otherwise CORBA::DATA_CONVERSION
          errors will be thrown in this TAO_RT_Servant_Dispatcher::post_invoke().

Tue Feb 11 13:58:23 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/vc7_orbsvcs.mwc: Added this temporary file that
          specifies nightly VC7 build targets under orbsvcs.

        * tao/tao.mpc: Added LF_Invocation_Event.cpp and LF_CH_Event.cpp.

Tue Feb 11 12:48:12 UTC 2003  Gautam Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp:
        * utils/catior/Makefile:
          Modified catior to better print Priority Model Policy.
          Required changes to Makefile to now link wiht RTCORBA which
          should be ok since RT CORBA is built by default. Did not
          wish to have two versions of catior pgm, or some conditional
          compiles.

Tue Feb 11 07:11:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/DLL_ORB/client.bor:

          Fixed errors in these BCB makefiles.

Mon Feb 10 17:12:30 2003  Otis Nyandoro <o.nyandoro@ee.wits.ac.za>

        * tests/RTCORBA/check_supported_priorities.cpp: Changed the
          function to take in a ORB pointer. The function now queries the
          ORB to get the scheduling policy in place before checking the
          priority levels. Using SCHED_OTHER as it was done before doesnt
          work well on Linux and it was broken.

          good starting point for the bug reports that showed up about
          RTCORBA on Linux.

          We need to relook into stressing these tests after 1.3.1 using
          multiple scheduling policies. We have very less time to within
          the short timeframe available.

Mon Feb 10 19:28:43 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Fri Feb  7 14:04:59 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/InterfaceDef_i.cpp:

          Added a check, when iterating through inherited operations
          and attributes, for the existence of an attribute or
          operation subsection in each parent, before trying to
          read the number of operations or attributes the parent
          has. If an interface has no operations, the operations
          ACE_Configuration subsection will not have been created,
          likewise for attributes. Thanks to Matej Sekoranja
          <matej.sekoranja@ijs.si> for pointing out the potential bug.

        * tao/PortableServer/AMH_Response_Handler.cpp:

          Added fix so that oneways work with AMH. Because of semantics of
          oneways, the client doesn't expect any reply. The RH doesn't
          know this and thinking that a RH is being destroyed before being
          sent, it tries to send a exception to the client. This hangs the
          server. The current fix handles oneways separately and doesn't
          try and be 'intelligent' in the RH destruction process (and
          doesn't try and send an exception to the cleint). Thanks to
          Andrey Nechypurenko@mchp <Andrey.Nechypurenko@mchp.siemens.de>
          for reporting a problem that led to uncovering of this
          problem. Thanks to Balachandran Natarajan

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/InterfaceDef_i.cpp (create_attribute):

          Changed the behavior to eliminate the creation of a corresponding
          repository entry for the operations asssociated with an
          attribute in the C++ mapping. On the backend, this mainly affects
          describe_interface(). Since the latter operation's return type,
          CORBA::FullInterfaceDescription, contains fields for both
          attributes and operations, it doesn't seem necessary to include
          the _get_* and _set_* operations in the operation list. It also
          seems that this behavior will make the TAO IFR more
          iteroperable with IFRs from other ORB vendors. Thanks to
          Matej Sekoranja <matej.sekoranja@ijs.si> for pointing this out.

          doesn't exist in that scope.  Fixes compile-time problems
          revealed by some compilers.  Thanks to Matthias Blankenhaus

          Renamed the argument of the visit_interface() method from
          interface to interf. The MingW compiler has a macro defined
          interface and this causes problems, so renamed the argument
          name to fix compile errors with MingW.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.h: Added a new protected constructor
          that can be used by the derived classes. This constructor just
          initializes itself and its base classes without initializing the
          transport. This is needed since the derived classes may want to
          initialize its own version of the transport.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connection_Handler.cpp: Use the
          new constructor to initialize the base class.

          This fixes [BUG 1421]. Thanks to Jon Reis and Wayne Erchak for
          reporting the problem.

Wed Jan 29 12:43:06 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{cpp,h}:  Encapsulated all static members of
          TAO_ORB_Core into a TAO_ORB_Core_Static_Resources singleton.  By
          accessing all of these variables through the singleton, this
          alleviates the constructor call ordering problem inwhich
          constructors in other compliation units (a.k.a some TAO shared
          libraries) are called before those in TAO_ORB_Core and modify
          the TAO_ORB_Core static variables before they are constructed.
          This caused segfaults when it happened, and seemed to affect
          OpenBSD the most.

          Note that this change is selfcontained and does not affect any
          other classes.

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/Server_Thread_Pool.cpp: Removed a
          debug statement where we print exceptions. This is expected in
          this test.

          Delayed the check for abstract interfaces in the
          ancestry of a non-abstract interface until just before
          the knowledge is needed for the first time in code
          generation. This corrects a problem with forward
          declared interfaces whose full definition member has
          not yet been replaced by its final value. Thanks to
          Michael Soden <soden@ikv.de> for reporting the
          problem.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.cpp:
          In case no conf. file is specified, the EC will default to
          reactive concurrency.  This fixes the problem of the Notify
          crashing without any conf. file. Thanks to Dennis Sporcic
          <dennis@hsa.com.au> and Frederic Langlet
          <Frederic.Langlet@alcatel.com> for reporting this problem.

Mon Jan 27 23:01:43 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Transport.cpp:  Fixed code
          that was supposed to fake out a good error return when the call
          to send() fails.  This fixes an exception break on WinXP when
          the network cable is unplugged and a program makes a MIOP
          request.  The justification behide ignoring the error is
          explained further in the code, but basically, it takes advantage
          of the fact that MIOP is unreliable by specification, and hopes
          that the source of the error will be corrected.  Thanks to
          Antonio Leonforte <a.leonforte@mclink.it> for pointing out the
          exception break.

Mon Jan 27 19:16:33 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        Made the following changes to fix the race related crashes of
        Notify seen in orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen -

        * orbsvcsy/orbsvcs/Notify/Builder.cpp:
          Added a refcount on each parent object per child object.
          This way the parent is always alive when the child is destroyed.
          When the child is destroyed, the parent count is decremented.
          The ensures a bottom-up destruction of the Notify object tree.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.h:
          Made the TAO_NS_Object class a TAO_NS_Refcountable. Moved the
          <has_shutdown> method to this class from TAO_NS_Object_T.
          The <shutdown> method sets the <shutdown_> flag atomically.
          It returns 1 if this object has been shutdown already. All
          derived classes should consult the TAO_NS_Object::shutdown
          method's return value to determine if the shutdown should
          proceed in case of multiple calls to shutdown.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object_T.h:
          Decrement the count on this Objects parent in the destructor.
          Changed the signature of destroy similar to <shutdown> to avoid
          multiple destoy's.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Container_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Container_T.h:
          The <collection_> owned by the Container is destroyed in the
          <shutdown> method now. The releases the reference count on child
          objects.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannel.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.cpp:
          The <destroy> method checks the return value of base destroy
          method before proceeding.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_Entry_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_Entry_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_Entry_T.inl:
          Made the Event_Map_Entry a refcounted object.
          The <usage_count_> member is incremented when the <find> method
          returns a suitable entry.
          The caller is responsible for decrementing the count when it no
          longer needs the entry.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_T.inl:
          <find> method now returns the entry (from which the collection
          can be obtained).
          The <remove> method decrements the count on the entry instead of
          deleteting it.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Lookup.cpp:
          Obtains the correct map entry and uses the collection in that
          entry. The map is released when it is done using it.
          Note that the map pointer is guaranteed to be valid because the
          Lookup object holds a reference count to the proxy that holds a
          count on its parent and so on up to the EventChannel. The
          EventChannel only destroys the Event_manager in its destructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.h:
          Added a fake <_decr_refcnt> to satisfy the template requirements
          from TAO_NS_Object_T. This will be rectified in future revisions.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxyConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxyConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxySupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxySupplier.h:
          Modified the <shutdown> implementation to follow the checks as
          described above.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer_Reactor.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer_Reactor.h:
          Made the Timer a refcounted object.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer_Queue.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer_Queue.h:
          Added an <impl> method to obtain the timer implementation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Worker_Task.h:
          Removed the <init> method which is not required here.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.h:
          Added an <init> method in which the Reactor based timer is
          allocated.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.h:
          The Timer Queue is allocated in the <init> method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
          Because the timer is now refcounted, we must release it on
          shutdown.

Mon Jan 27 17:36:51 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor.cpp:

          Added missing switch case that prevented tao_ifr from
          recognizing the element type of sequence<Object> in
          an IDL file. Thanks to Andrey Nechypurenko@mchp
          <Andrey.Nechypurenko@mchp.siemens.de> for sending in
          the example IDL file that uncovered the problem.

Mon Jan 27 16:47:31 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Miop/McastHello/run_test.pl: Fixed incorrect
          reference to $SV in error handling code.  Thanks to Craig
          Rodrigues for pointing this out.

Mon Jan 27 09:48:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/RTCorba/Multiple_Endpoints/Common/Common.mpc:
          Add missing dllflags

        * performance-tests/RTCorba/Multiple_Endpoints/Common/Makefile:
          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Sun Jan 26 17:29:34 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Leader_Follower.cpp (wait_for_event): Set LFS_TIMEOUT on the
          LF_Event only if the follower timesout. The follower could
          return with a -1 from wait () even if errors other than timeout
          occurs, like connection closure and such.

        * tao/LF_CH_Event.cpp: Added a comment

Sun Jan 26 17:23:22 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Notify_Handler.cpp (TAO_Notify_Handler):
        * tao/Notify_Handler.h:

          - Added a new constructor and a create_handler () method which
            takes in a transport and the ACE_HANDLE that this handler would
            be used for.

          - Deprecating the old create_handler () and the constructor.
            They have been left there for backward compatibility.

          The above changes were made to get around a problem that Yakov
          Becker and Johnny Willemsen observed in one of their
          applications. We havent been able to reproduce the problem here
          at all. The gist of the problem is

           - A server thread after buffering lots of incoming messages
             starts processing one of the messages. Keeping the handle
             suspended it wakes up another thread in the Reactor.

           - The first thread after processing the request tries to write
             a reply only to find the socket closed. It starts the
             cleanup and disassociates the transport and the handler. So
             far so good.

           - The second thread that is woken up now tries to get to the
             handler and then to the transport to process the queued
             messages. But the transport is already disassociated from the
             handler and the assert fails.

           We address this problem by using the transport as the mechanism
           to process messages instead of the handler. The above changes
           were made to accomodate the change in philosophy.

         * tao/Transport.cpp: Used the new method to create the
           Notify_Handler.

Sat Jan 25 18:10:10 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_IIOP_SSL/Makefile: Fixed dependencies.
        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_IIOP_SSL/test_i.cpp: Cosmetic fixes.
        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Makefile: Added the new file to the DIRS
          section.

Sat Jan 25 17:55:10 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_IIOP_SSL/client.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_IIOP_SSL/server.dsp: Added necessary
          libraries for linking.

Sat Jan 25 18:55:47 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_IIOP_SSL/test_i.h: Fixed a compilation error.

Sat Jan 25 18:50:32 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp (close_i): Avoid totally
          unaesthetic temporaries  in the for loop.

Sat Jan 25 18:30:27 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_IIOP_SSL: A multi-threaded stress test
          for IIOP_SSL which basically provides a insecure path for
          communication incase an SSL connection cannot be setup. This
          will also serve as a stress test for BUG 1421.

Sat Jan 25 18:06:51 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.h:
        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.inl: Added an accessor for the hash
          map used inside the Cache_Manager. Useful for writing regression
          tests as we will demonstrate shortly in a test.

Fri Jan 24 11:42:57 2003  Boris S Kolpackov  <boris@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Crash_Test/run_test.pl: fixed yet another
          possible race conditions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface_strategy.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_identifier.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_stack.cpp:

          Changed some deletes of strings to use either delete []
          or ACE::strdelete(), to eliminate some complaints from
          Linux valgrind. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>
          for reporting the problem and for sending in patches.

Fri Jan 24 09:04:28 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_interface_header.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in error-checking the inheritance of abstract
          interfaces. Thanks to Michael Soden <soden@ikv.de> for
          reporting the IDL compiler's incorrect error message.

Fri Jan 24 08:23:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_UDP_Sender.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/MCast.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/RTP.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/TCP.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/UDP.cpp:
          Use ACE_IOV_MAX instead of IOV_MAX. IOV_MAX is defined as
          MAX_INT-1 with Cygwn and this gives compiles errors because
          an array as struct member of this size is too large.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Worker.h:
          Fixed type in comment

        * orbsvcs/PSS/Makefile.datastore:
        * orbsvcs/PSS/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTEventLogAdmin:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.DsLogAdmin:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.DsEventLogAdmin:
          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Thu Jan 23 18:29:03 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * tests/MT_Timeout/client.cpp: Modified ACE_DEBUG to
          print a warning instead of an error when "Too many
          calls have too big differences..."

Thu Jan 23 16:31:28 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/idl_global.h:

          Fixed a bug in the clearing of a #pragma prefix directive
          at the end of an indirectly included IDL file, based on an
          example set of five IDL files sent in by
          John Fletcher <john.fletcher@rd.bbc.co.uk>

Thu Jan 23 11:30:04 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orsbvcs/IFRService/Container_i.cpp (store_label):

          Changed a static cast from ulonglong to u_int to use
          ACE_U64_TO_U32. Thanks to Rob Andzik <andzik@rtlogic.com>
          for reporting the problem on VxWorks and Carlos O'Ryan
          <coryan@atdesk.com> for pointing out the fix.

Thu Jan 23 10:54:23 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/DynamicAny/DynCommon.cpp (get_reference):

          Fixed memory leak. Thanks to Grigory <grig@plesk.com> for
          reporting the bug.

Wed Jan 22 14:56:22 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (invoke_i): Unbind the dispatcher instead of
          setting the state in the Bind_Dispatcher_Guard. Improves code
          readability.

Wed Jan 22 11:08:57 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Messaging/Messaging_Policy_i.cpp (hook): Fixed debug message
          so that it actually printed out milliseconds rather than the
          microsecond component expressed as milliseconds.

Wed Jan 22 17:03:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Transport.cpp:
          Use ACE_IOV_MAX instead of IOV_MAX. IOV_MAX is defined as
          MAX_INT-1 with Cygwn and this gives compiles errors because
          an array as struct member of this size is too large.

Wed Jan 22 16:34:32 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTCORBAEvent:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTSchedEvent:
          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Tue Jan 21 15:31:46 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:

          Modified code handling #pragma version directive to handle
          the case where one or more of the spaces between the words
          in the directive contains a tab. Thanks to Dima Scub
          <dima_scub@sniip.ru> for reporting the bug. This closes
          [BUGID:1425].

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:

          Changed the file that generates lex.yy.cpp to reflect the
          change above.

Tue Jan 21 19:28:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Makefile.av:
        * Makefile.CosLoadBalancing:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Crash_Test/run_test.pl: fixed few
          race conditions.

Mon Jan 20 18:46:17 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/README.txt (ImplRepoService): Fixed
          incorrect usages of InitRef ID ImplRepo_Service which should
          really be ImplRepoService.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/tao_imr_i.cpp (run):
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Activator_i.cpp (init): On Win32,
          changed to use ACE_OS::hostname to get the "machine name" and
          then use the name to acquire the full DNS name of the machine.
          Without this extra step, ImpoRepo uses the all-caps, short form
          name of the machine, which causes a mismatch with the incoming
          corbaloc endpoint name.  Perhaps ACE_OS::hostname needs to be
          fixed on Win32 to return.  These changes allow ImplRepo to
          startup correctly on Win32.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Locator_i.cpp (server_is_running):
          The following change seemed to be missing for some reason.
          Figured out what to do and fixed it.

        Mon Nov 11 09:28:43 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>

                * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Locator_i.cpp:
                  Get the whole hostname name including the domain instead
                  of just the hostname.
                  Thanks to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi@mivzak.com> for pointing
                  out a exception thats raised.


Mon Jan 20 18:05:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/LF_Connect_Strategy.cpp: Removed debugging statements that
          needed access to the transport object. The transport object
          could dissappear even before the thread gets to this point  and
          it is only chaos after that.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp (make_connection):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp: Added debugging
          statements to make up for the loss from the above change.

        * tao/Leader_Follower.cpp: Added comments and also made sure that
          we access the transport object only when debugging is turned on.

          Thanks to Duane Binder for sharing his purify logs from his runs
          that he ran for a long time (which wouldnt have been possible at
          all for us)

Mon Jan 20 16:42:34 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp (bind_dispatcher): Added a lock to synchronize
          acces to the map. It *was* initially thought that
          synchronization will not be required since we always believed
          that only one thread could be active in the map. This is *not*
          true since a thread could be accessing the transport from the
          invocation side whereas another thread could be accessing the
          transport and the map underneath from the LF. This is really
          really bad.

Mon Jan 20 13:32:30 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/README.txt: Fixed a broken HTML tag.

Mon Jan 20 12:03:03 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/DynamicInterface/Request.cpp:

Mon Jan 20 08:00:44 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Removed multiple inclusions of an

          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Sat Jan 18 12:07:14 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.cpp: Fixed my fix by removing
        a #define I used to test the fix.

Sat Jan 18 10:40:58 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added TAO_RD_TABLE_SIZE and set the value to be
          16.

        * tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp:
        * tao/Muxed_TMS.h: Used the TAO_RD_TABLE_SIZE to configure the
          internal hash map. This is now hard coded. We should have a way
          for the user to configure the size of these hash maps and it will
          be integrated after 1.3.2.

Fri Jan 17 14:22:48 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.cpp: Fixed explicit
        instantiation to instantiate TAO_Singleton rather than
        ACE_Singleton.  This fixes the RH71_Explicit_Templates build.

Fri Jan 17 08:34:57 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.h: Removed an extra
          ';'. This may nor may not help the Borland builds.

Thu Jan 16 17:24:30 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ETCL_FilterFactory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ETCL_FilterFactory.h:
          Make the FilterFactory a RefCounted servant.
          This allows us to cleanup this object when the ChannelFactory
          dies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/NotifyExt.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.h:
          Extend the ChannelFactory interface to include a destroy method.
          This allows us to check for memory leaks using a tool like
          purify when the channel factory is destroyed.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventType.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventType.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventTypeSeq.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventTypeSeq.h:
          Made the <dump> methods const.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object_T.h:
          The <shutdown_> flag is now set in the Object_T::destroy method.
          Note that if multiple threads that encounter dispatch failure
          try to destroy the proxy object, only the first one will run the
          destroy method, others will check for the shutdown flag and
          return. This fixes the random crashes in some of the Linux
          builds on the scoreboard (orbsvcs/tests/Notify/MT_Dispatching).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Proxy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Proxy.h:
          Changed the <subscribed_types> method to return a copy of the
          curent subscriptions. This method has been corrected to be
          thread safe.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Peer.cpp:
          Changed to new usage of Proxy::subscribed_types.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.h:
          Use TAO_Singleton instead of ACE_Singleton.

Thu Jan 16 16:27:59 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

       * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.{h,cpp}: Added patches from
         this checkin "Mon Oct 28 18:21:18 CET 2002  Oliver Kellogg
         <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>". The patches mysteriously
         dissappeared. Thanks to Oliver Kellogg for alerting me.

Thu Jan 16 13:25:10 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/rtcorba/features.html: Fixed obsolete references to the
          location of various priority mapping source files.

Thu Jan 16 12:29:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * COPYING: Extended the validity of the copyright notice from 2002
          to 2003. Should have been done yesterday.., anyway, better late
          than never.

Thu Jan 16 10:52:07 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/smart_proxy_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/smart_proxy_cs.cpp:

          In the generated TAO_*_Proxy_Factory_Adapter class,
          changed signatures of register_proxy_factory() and
          unregister_proxy_factory() to return void. Error
          reporting through return type is not necessary, since
          native exceptions or an environment variable are
          already used, and there is no code in either of these
          methods that sets the return value to anything other
          than 0. Although the methods are public, the class
          itself has a protected constructor, and the methods
          are intended for TAO internal use only.
          This closes [BUGID:844].

Wed Jan 15 18:02:49 2003  Bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

Tue Jan 14 15:10:53 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:

          Added a check and graceful exit for the case where the -H command
          line option is not followed by a selection (i.e., is followed by
          another dash-prefixed command line option or by nothing). The case
          where the selection exists but is invalid was already handled.
          Thanks to Chip Jones <jones_c@ociweb.com> for reporting the bug.
          This fix closes [BUGID:1422].

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/Makefile.IFR_Service: Added a check for
          TAO_IFRService library before going head to actually compile
          stuff.

Mon Jan 13 10:12:20 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp:

          Removed generation of
          'friend class <remote/thru-POA/direct proxy class name>' for local
          interfaces.

Mon Jan 13 12:47:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Use ACE_IOV_MAX instead of IOV_MAX. IOV_MAX is defined as MAX_INT-1
          with Cygwn and this gives compiles array because an array of this
          size is allocated on the stack.

        * tao/Makefile.tao:
          When building shared lib then set the define TAO_BUILD_DLL, when
          building statically set the define TAO_AS_STATIC_LIBS

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.h:
        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp: Added a debug
          statement. Removed the method close_entries () which was under
          #if 0 guard.

          The method is_entry_idle () was trying to make the transport as
          busy, which is horribly horribly bad. The method is_entry_idle
          () should only do one thing, ie. check whether the entry is idle
          or not!

Fri Jan 10 08:28:34 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Connection_Handler.cpp:

          Removed call to unsubscribe from multicast socket as this happens
          automatically.  Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@ieee.org> for
          pointing this out.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Transport.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Transport.h:

          Added code to check length of MIOP UniqueID so that it can be
          properly parsed.  Thanks to Chau Vincent
          <Vincent.Chau@fr.thalesgroup.com> for finding the problem when
          performing MIOP interoperability testing.  Also, added code to
          set the UniqueID and packet length fields properly per update to
          the MIOP spec and tightened bounds checks on MIOP packets to
          prevent buffer overruns.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Miop/McastHello/client.cpp:

          Fixed spelling error.

        * tao/try_macros.h: Removed the file from the repo. This is no
          longer used and seems like a good time to remove it. Thanks to
          Oliver Kellog for reminding us.

        * tao/Reactive_Connect_Strategy.cpp:
        * tao/LF_Connect_Strategy.cpp: Used the cached pointer to access
          the ORB_Core, instead of accessing the ORB_Core in the
          transport. The reason why this should be done this way is too
          involved to explain here, but suffice to say that in highly
          multi-threaded environments the transports could dis-sappear
          before the connection handlers. Accessing the ORB_Core from the
          transport could then lead to vague crashes.

          very simple test, to measure the memory consumed by the server
          for unmarshalling an IOR. This test will not be compiled in all
          the builds, but only in the builds where the scripts are run.

        * performance-tests/Memory/Makefile: Added the new test to the
          list of directories.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/idl_global.h:

          Changes to the management of the IDL compiler's stack of prefixes,
          to address a problem that appeared when there is a chain of
          included IDL files. Thanks to Adee Ran <adeeran@yahoo.com> for
          reporting the problem and supplying example IDL files to
          reproduce it.

Fri Jan 03 14:22:14 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Server.cpp:
          Moved the call to <init> to catch any resulting exceptions and
          exit gracefully.

        The following changes are made to fix the crashes observed on the
        scoreboard in the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Test.
        Thanks to Irfan and Bala for helping to fix this problem.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Container_T.cpp:
          Changed the order of destruction of the Notify objects. The tree
          is destroyed bottom up. This ensures that proxy objects that
          refer to a valid parent during shutdown.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request.inl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Refcountable.h:

          Moved the TAO_NS_Refcountable_Guard class from Method_Request.*
          files into Refcountable.* files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.cpp:
          Moved the <worker_task_> and <proxy_poa_> data member shutdown
          from the destructor to the <shutdown> method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object_T.cpp:
          Replaced the TAO_NS_Object_RefCount_Guard with
          TAO_NS_Refcountable_Guard.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Peer.cpp:
          Protect the Peer from being destroyed while it is dispatching
          updates by using a TAO_NS_Refcountable_Guard.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Types.h:
          Removed the TAO_NS_Object_RefCount_Guard class. We use
          TAO_NS_Refcountable_Guard instead.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/Batch_Buffering_Strategy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/Batch_Buffering_Strategy.h:
          Modified the <dequeue_available> method to return the number of
          pending events.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.h:
          + Protect the call to the event batch <push> method with
          TAO_NS_Refcountable_Guard so that the proxy (and hence this
          peer) is not destroyed while the push is in progress.
          + Reset the pacing error on dispatch error so that we don't
          schedule a timer on an object that is about to be destroyed.
          + Schedule a timer in the <handle_timeout> method only if there
          are pending events.

          Moved generation of AMH exception holder raise_* method
          body from the stub header file to the stub source file. Also
          added explicit include of ace/Auto_Ptr when generating AMH
          classes (needed to correct AIX build errors).

        * tao/RTCORBA/RTCORBAC.h:

          Added a second macro TAO_INSTANTIATING_TEMPLATES to the safety
          check for these files to determine if the AIX compiler is
          instantiating templates.  If it is instantiating, then we must
          allow the compiler to #include these files.

          id before waiting as a follower or drive the event loop as
          leader, and use the cached id for all the debug statements. The
          transport object could dissappear during the process of waiting

Sat Dec 28 13:09:53 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Transport.cpp (recv_i): Changed the recv_i
          method to handle closed socket correctly.  The original
          implementation caused SHMIOP falling into an infinite loop when
          the other end closed the connection.

Fri Dec 27 20:00:41 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/run_test.pl: Added more threads in the
          client to stress the ORB.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Locator_i.cpp:
          Decrementing the reference count for object references
          when unbinding it from the map. Thanks to Carlos for pointing
          it out. Fixed bug 1403.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/run_test.pl:
          Fixed the typo in passing the name of the file to the ORBInitRef
          option. Did some minor indentation modifications.

Fri Dec 27 15:03:36 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/ior_corbaloc: Removed.

        * tao/CORBALOC_Parser.h:
        * tao/CORBALOC_Parser.cpp:
          Modified the signature of parse_string_assign_helper. We dont
          have to send the length of original string as an argument.
          When invoking assign_ke_string, the length of the token needs
          to be sent as opposed to the length of the whole address.
          Thanks to Bertin Colpron <BColpron@interstarinc.com>
          for pointing out.

        * examples/ior_corbaloc: Moved the test from tests/ior_corbaloc to
          examples. Moving the test to examples directory would help us to
          run the test in our daily builds.

Fri Dec 27 07:56:31 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp (create_module):

          Added a line to propagate the prefix of a module to a reopening of
          that module in another IDL file, overlooked in the changes of

          Wed Dec 11 18:26:09 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          which was causing a reference (in a third IDL file) to a member of
          the reopened module to lack the correct prefix, if it had been set.
          Thanks to Nanbor Wang <nanbor@cse.wustl.edu> for reporting the
          problem.

Thu Dec 26 09:07:21 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Simple/Simple_Util.h: Added a method to return the
          client side ORB.
        * examples/Simple/grid/Grid_Client_i.cpp: Hold the Grid_Factory's
          object reference in a var instead of a pointer. This prevents

Mon Dec 23 22:33:56 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        A slight redesign of the changes applied to fix BUG 1276. The
        redesign was motivated due to a  drop in our performance.

        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.h:
        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.i: Did a slight redesign of how timeouts are
          handled.  This was necessitated since the previous design made
          things slow. Though none of the synchronization primitives were
          used for normal cases ie. invocations without timeouts, we still
          created them for every invocation. Creation of synchronizaton
          primitives actually made things slow, and they have now been
          removed.

        * tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp: Removed calls to start_dispatch () and
          end_dispatch () on the Reply_Dispatcher.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: We now do a synchronization on the internal
          lock used by Muxed_TMS strategy so that no two threads are
          active on the Reply_Handler at the same time. This, though not
          very elegant, provides the same effect as the changes in "Sun
          Dec 22 11:26:30 2002  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>". The gist of the changes
          mentioned above have still been retained.

        * tao/Exclusive_TMS.cpp: Removed calls to start_dispatch and
          end_dispatch () on the Reply_Dispatcher.

          These changes should get our performance back on track.

          setting of the <collocation_resolver_name_> from the constructor
          to create (), since it is not required immediately on loading
          the RT_PortableServer. This should fix a problem with GCC 2.95
          builds on Solaris where the static initializations are all
          messed up! Surprising that other tests even work.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp: Fixed warnings in
          SunCC builds. Yet another problem with SunCC compiler. This
          should also hopefully fix a similar problem with Borland 6.

Sun Dec 22 22:46:50 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Replaced the word "error" from one
          of the debug statements. The test
          tests/RTCORBA/MT_Client_Protocol_Priority uses a script that
          parses the output from the test run to determine if the test was
          right. The script searches for the word "error" in the output
          and on seeing it barf's. Hence the change.

        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.h:
        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.i: Added an accessor for <timeout_>

        * tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp: Call start_dispatch () and end_dispatch ()
          only if the Reply_Dispatcher has timout associated with it. This
          should fix most of the problems that showed up in the latest
          builds.

        * performance-tests/Latency/Thread_Per_Connection/svc.conf: Used
          the blocked connect strategy instead of the default
          strategy. This is needed to work around the problem outlined in
          BUG 1408.

Sun Dec 22 11:26:30 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        Fix for Bug 1276. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1276 for more
        details on this bug. The gist of the fix is this

          - If a follower thread timesout, it first tries to unbind the
            dispatcher from the table

          - If unbinding is succesfull it throws a TIMEOUT exception to
            the client.

          - If unbinding is unsuccesful, it waits on a condition variable
            in the reply dispatcher

          - Once the reply is available it dispatches the reply.

          - This helps avoid the race conditions that are documented in
            1276.

        None of the above code should be executed when timeouts are not
        enabled in the ORB ie. for the default path.

        * tao/Bind_Dispatcher_Guard.cpp:
        * tao/Bind_Dispatcher_Guard.h:
        * tao/Bind_Dispatcher_Guard.i: Added method unbind_dispatcher ()
          which unbinds the dispatcher from the Transport_Mux_Strategy and
          status (), which allows to set the status of the dispatcher
          guard.

        * tao/Transport_Mux_Strategy.h
        * tao/Exclusive_TMS.cpp:
        * tao/Exclusive_TMS.h:
        * tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp:
        * tao/Muxed_TMS.h: Changed the signature of the method
          unbind_dispatcher (). It now returns an int. Further, we mark
          the Reply_Dispatcher as busy when the dispatching thread is
          ready to call Reply_Dispatcher::dispatch_reply ().

        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.cpp:
        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.h:
        * tao/Reply_Dispatcher.i: Added a mutex and a condition variable
          for the follower to wait on when a leader thread is within the
          Reply_Dispatcher. Methods to wait on the CV and to mark the
          reply_dispatcher as being used and free have been added. These
          methods are essentially no-ops if timeouts are not set.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Invocation.h: If the invocation thread gets a timeout, it
          first unbinds its reply dispatcher from the Mux_Strategy. If the
          unbind fails (this means that another thread has aleardy
          collected the reply from the transport) , it waits on the
          reply_dispatcher to collect the reply instead of just throwing a
          TIMEOUT exception.

          Added a patch sent in by Greg Mulyar <greg_mu@yahoo.com> to make
          sure that the ACE version of gperf is used when both the ACE and
          GNU versions of gperf are present. This fixes BUG 1406.

          errors in NO_AMI_MESSAGING and NO_INTERCEPTORS builds.

Thu Dec 19 08:25:04 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

          TAO_Transport::close_connection_no_purge () in
          TAO_Transport_Cache_Manager::purge () instead of
          close_connection_i (). Surprising that Chris Cleeland missed
          this after we agreed that this was the right things to do. Looks
          like Chris C has been caught up in a different world altogether
          :-). This should fix the  errors in the daily builds.

Wed Dec 18 19:45:45 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_declarator.cpp:

          Added a check for 0 return from a narrow to AST_Type. This
          check catches attempts to use constants, enum values,
          attributes, and operations as IDL sequence elements, and
          outputs an error instead of crashing. Thanks to Petr
          Ferschmann <pferschmann@kerio.com> for pointing out the
          problem with enum values.

          this spec-required operator. This fixes BUG 1404.

          (tao_lb_random_init_routine):

          the Pthread standard.  This function should always be visible.

Tue Dec 17 09:53:02 2002  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.*:

          Fixed deadlock that can occur when trying to gain reactor token
          and transport cache manager lock while purging cache entries.
          Unfortunately , the classic solution to the classic
          deadlock-- which is typically caused by an ordering problem, and is
          solved by re-ordering--doesn't apply.  We simply don't have
          control of the order due to the fact that we have two frameworks
          interacting, and the offending bodies of code don't have
          visibility to both locks.

          The key is not trying to remove the handler while the transport
          cache lock is held.  So, we break this into two loops.  The first
          loop does everything cache-releated with only the cache lock held,
          then releases it.  The second loop then does only the
          reactor-related things.

          Key changes are:

          - Move purge() from .inl to .cpp.
          - Fold close_entries() into purge() (purge was the only thing that
            called close_entries anyway).
          - Use a stack to accumulate the transports that have been purged
            in the first loop, then, in the second loop, pop the stack and
            call the remove_handler on each transport.
          - Note that the transports whose pointers are stuck in the stack
            are properly reference counted using
            TAO_Transport::_duplicate/release.

          Thanks to Raytheon in San Diego for providing the environment to
          find this!

        * tao/Policy_Validator.cpp: Reset the last_ to zero during
          destruction. If not reset, it starts creating problem during
          reloading of libraries since they see that last_ is not zero but
          pointing to a stale location. Thanks to Guan
          Joe <annieg608@hotmail.com> for reporting this. Having a static
          member is not the way to go. But let me hold on till 1.3 goes
          out of the way.

          Removed the String_var non-const cast operator to char*,
          as per http://cgi.omg.org/issues/issue3797.txt, and made
          necessary changes to TAO where CORBA::String_var is
          passed to strcpy, strcat, etc., without using .out()
          or .inout().

        * tao/CORBA_String.h:
        * tao/CORBA_String.inl:

          Added the spec-required cast operator to char*& for

          Further changes to the #pragma prefix handling. Special checks
          had to be added to deal with the unique behavior of the
          preprocessor on the Linux platforms.

Sat Dec 14 17:08:17 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer_Queue.cpp: Reverted "Sat Dec 14
          09:19:30 2002  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>"  since the offending ACE
          change has been reverted. Thanks to Dr. Schmidt for reverting
          the ACE change.

Sat Dec 14 09:19:30 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Timer_Queue.cpp: #included Reactor.h. No
          reason to do this, but this change in ACE makes us do this
          "Fri Dec 13 16:05:05 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt
          <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>"

          The above change just couples the Reactor and the timerqueue
          code.

Fri Dec 13 17:37:25 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/AdminProperties.cpp:
          Added the "Error" word in the debug message so
          that it shows up red in the scoreboard on run error.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/run_test.pl:
          AdminProperties test is run conditionally - skipped when the
          Notification is in Reactive mode, because the Reactive mode does
          not support any queues to test the MaxQueueLength Admin
          Property. In the MT mode, it uses the adminproperties.conf

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/MT_Dispatching/run_test.pl:
          The Notify output is no longer parsed, as the debug messages
          have changed.

Fri Dec 13 12:52:31 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosLoadBalancing.idl:

          Added missing "RequestsPerSecond" LoadId constant.

          Reordered register_load_monitor() parameters so that they are
          consistent with the other methods in the PortableGroup and
          CosLoadBalancing modules (i.e. object to be registered is last
          argument).

          Uncommented Strategy::analyze_loads() method.  It is required
          for adaptive load balancing support.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LoadManager.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LoadManager.cpp
          (register_load_monitor):

          Updated parameter list to match the updated IDL.

          Unbind the load monitor just registered if scheduling of the
          timer handler fails.  Fixes a resource leak.

          Fixed problem where it wasn't possible to register more than one
          load monitor.

          (push_loads):

          Invoke the Strategy::analyze_loads() method on load
          balancing strategies associated with object groups that have
          members residing at the given location.  This is an adaptive
          load balancing fix.

          (check_strategy_prop, preprocess_properties):

          Replaced check_strategy_prop() method with the new
          preprocess_properties() method.  In addition to performing the
          property checks found in the check_strateg_prop() method,
          preprocess_properties() also converts the "StrategyInfo"
          property to a "Strategy" property.  This allows applications to
          retrieve references to the built-in strategies, in addition to
          fixing a problem where different LeastLoaded strategy
          configurations could not be created.

          (next_member):

          Since built-in load balancing strategy references are now stored
          in the object group's property list, the same code that was used
          for the custom strategies may be used for the built-in ones.
          The code is now much cleaner.

          (init_least_loaded):

          Removed this method.  The introduction of the
          preprocess_properties() method obviates the need for this
          method.

          (extract_float_property):

          Move this method to the TAO_LB_LeastLoaded servant
          implementation.  It was only used by that servant.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LeastLoaded.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Random.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_RoundRobin.h:

          All built-in load balancing strategies are now unconstrained.
          Applications should be able to make invocations on those
          strategies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Random.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Random.cpp:

          Refactored out random number generator initialization code so
          that other balancing strategies (e.g. LeastLoaded) may
          initialize it if necessary.

          If a standard PThreads implementation is configured, use the
          pthread_once() function to force only a single initialization of
          the random number generator to occur.

          (get_loads, analyze_loads):

          Implemented these methods.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LeastLoaded.cpp
          (TAO_LB_LeastLoaded):

          Initialize the random number generator prior to selecting group
          members randomly.

          (get_location):

          Fixed default load rebalancing and request rejection behavior.
          By default, neither of these should happen, as required by the
          forthcoming CORBA Load Balancing and Monitoring specification.

          Fixed problem where the same location was always selected.

          Cleaned up the code quite a bit.

          (get_properties, get_loads, analyze_loads):

          Implemented these methods.

          (init):

          New method used to initialize the LeastLoaded servant.  All
          LeastLoaded property extraction and checking is performed in
          this method.  This method is invoked by the LoadManager when an
          application configures LeastLoaded as its balancing strategy.

          (extract_float_property):

          Method that extracts CORBA::Float values from a given
          LeastLoaded property.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_MemberLocator.cpp (pre_invoke):

          Cosmetic change.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_RoundRobin.cpp (get_loads):
          (analyze_loads):

          Implemented these methods.

        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/LoadManager.cpp (ACE_TMAIN):

          Updated
        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/LoadMonitor.cpp (register_load_monitor):

          Updated LoadManager::register_load_monitor() call arguments to
          match the updated IDL.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.idl (groups_at_location):

          Added new method to the ObjectGroupManager interface that
          returns a sequence of references to the ObjectGroups residing at
          a given location.  This method should be pushed into the
          forthcoming standard.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_ObjectGroupManager.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_ObjectGroupManager.cpp:

          Implemented ObjectGroupManager::groups_at_location() method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Hash_Naming_Context.cpp (resolve):

          Improved exception-safety, and a potential memory leak in the
          emulated exception case.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_tmplinst.cpp:

Fri Dec 13 00:10:23 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/AdminProperties.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiation for TAO_NS_AdminProperties_var

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Builder.cpp:
          Added a 2 step initialization of TAO_NS_AdminProperties object
          to appease Borland compiler.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/CosNotify_Initializer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/CosNotify_Initializer.h:
          Moved Initializer from Notify_Service.cpp to a seperate file.
          This should fix the bug related to multiple instances of the
          Initalizer. Thanks to Shelton Tang <stang@altigen.com> for
          reporting this.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.h:
          Removed Initializer class and implementation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.CosNotification:
        * orbsvcs/Orbsvcs/CosNotification.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/Orbsvcs/CosNotification_Static.dsp:

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Service.h:
          Replaced include for Initializer to "CosNotify_Initializer.h"

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/AdminProperties.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/AdminProperties.cpp:
          Modified the test to check MaxQueueLength and MaxSuppliers and
          MaxConsumers seperately. Events are dispatched in a seperate
          thread. The main thread receives events, an initial delay and
          a consumer delay can be configured to provide a lag in event
          delivery to force the Notification to buffer events.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Sequence.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Sequence.cpp:
          Added a test for sequences. In the default run, this test sends
          15 events in batches of 5 events via a sequence supplier. It
          sets the consumer's batch size to 3 and sets a pacing interval
          of 2 seconds. it checks to see if 15 events are indeed received.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/adminproperties.conf:
          Svc Conf file for the AdminProperties test - This prevents the
          supplier's event sending thread from reading incomming requests.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Makefile.bor:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Sequence.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Notify_Tests.dsw:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/run_test.pl:
          Added Sequence Test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/notify.conf:
          To apply the MaxEventsPerConsumer QoS we need configure a queue
          per proxysupplier.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Notify_Structured_Push_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Notify_Structured_Push_Consumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Structured_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Structured_Supplier.cpp:
          This test was expecting to receive the same number of events as
          the MaxEventsPerConsumer. We know that atleast 1 *extra* event
          will be delivered because the 1st event delivery causes the
          channel queue to fill up and discard events. Thus, we send 40
          events, set the MaxEventsPerConsumer at 10 and really expect to
          see 11 events, but we give some leeway and set the expected count
          at 13. far less compared to 40.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Persistent_Context_Index.cpp: Fixed
          an inappropriate use of ACE_NEW_RETURN where a placement new

          <torsten.kuepper@nokia.com> for reporting this.  Fixes [bugid
          1396].

        * docs/performance.html: Added suggestions on how to speedup

          Thanks to Duane Binder <duane.binder@veritas.com> for
          reporting that one of the "omg.org" prefixes in the

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/Batch_Buffering_Strategy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/Batch_Buffering_Strategy.h:

          The Batch Buffering strategy that extends the base
          Buffering_Strategy by adding methods to extract batch size events.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/AdminProperties.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/AdminProperties.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/AdminProperties.inl:
          Added a global queue lock and condition for global queue not
          empty. Added a TAO_NS_AdminProperties_var to manage
          AdminProperty lifetime.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.inl:
          The Buffering Strategy(BS) has been re-implemented:
          The BS now checks for a local and global maxima when enqueing
          events. If either maxima is reached and discarding is enabled,
          queued messages are discarded according to the discard policy.
          The global lock in the AdminProperties class (created per
          Event Channel)is used to serialize access to the global message
          count and condition variables.
          Note that the local maxima is infact due to the
          MaxEventsPerConsumer QoS property. Hence to use this property
          there must be a queue configured per proxy supplier. (using
          -AllocateTaskPerProxy directive in the svc.conf. see
          $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/notify.conf for an example)

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Builder.cpp:

          methods. The TAO_NS_Object now provides protected virtual
          methods to override concurrency related QoS application.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannel.cpp:
          Removed deletion of AdminProperties Object. As this object is
          now refcounted, it automatically gets destroyed when the
          EventChannel is destroyed. However, the EC might be destroyed
          before its child objects.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/FilterAdmin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/FilterAdmin.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Dispatch.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Dispatch.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Dispatch_No_Filtering.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Dispatch_No_Filtering.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Lookup.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Lookup.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Proxy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Proxy.h:
          "Constified" TAO_NS_Event_var parameter.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request.h:
          - Provided concrete implementations for the <execute> and <copy>
          methods.
          - Added <event> method to obtain the event wrapped by this
          Message.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.h:
          - Added <set_event_channel_threads> method.
          - Removed check for "threads > 0" in set_XXX_qos_properties
          method. If 0 threads are specified, the QoS property for
          concurrency defaults to a Reactive model.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.inl:
          - Added <apply_reactive_concurrency>,
          <apply_thread_pool_concurrency> and <apply_lane_concurrency> methods.
          These methods can be overridden for NS_Object specific concurrency QoS.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Property.h:
          - Removed reference to Notify_Signal_Property_T.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxySupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxySupplier.h:
          Overide TAO_NS_Object::qos_changed method. This method checks
          for the MaxEventsPerConsumer QoS property and applies it to the
          Buffering Strategy of the Worker Task.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.inl:
          Added acessors for timer and buffering strategy.
          The reactor base timer is used and there is no buffering
          strategy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.inl:
          This task delegates message enqueues and dequeues to the
          buffering strategy. The Timer_Queue is used to schedule timers.
          The <svc> method thus dispatches timers and executes command objects.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Worker_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Worker_Task.h:
          Added abstract accessors for timer and buffering strategy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushSupplier.h:
          Added NULL check before <release>ing the peer object.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.h:
          Changed timer handling and related code. Timers are set via the
          TAO_NS_Timer object obtained via this objects Proxy. If a
          dispatching thread is configured, events are now dispatched in
          the context of the dispatching thread and not in the main thread.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.CosNotification:
        * orbsvcs/Orbsvcs/CosNotification.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/Orbsvcs/CosNotification_Static.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/Orbsvcs/CosNotification.bor:
          Updated.

Wed Dec 11 16:26:48 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_Mcast_EH.cpp: Removed redundant
          template instantiations that have already been instantiated
          through specialization. This should clear up one of the builds
          on the scoreboard.

Tue Dec 10 19:30:56 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ci.cpp:

          Removed all memory management from the *_forany classes. A close reading
          of the spec, and discussion with Bala, made it clear that this
          class is meant to be nothing more than a helper for the overloaded Any
          and CDR stream operators, and should not make any memory management
          decisions of its own. Thanks to Petr Tuma <petr.tuma@mff.cuni.cz>
          for reporting the oversight.

Tue Dec 10 18:17:12 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (send_message): Formatted the debug
          statement to print out %m instead of %p. The TAO_Transport
          object under some circumstances return -1 with errno set to
          ENOENT. %m would then be a bit more softer than %p which leads
          to crashes.

Tue Dec 10 16:15:09 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile: Added a target 'reverseclean' to be used in our daily
          builds.

Mon Dec  9 22:25:06 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/vardecl_ss.cpp:

          Added initialization for INOUT and OUT argument declarations in the
          skeleton body when they are of any integer or floating point type.
          This is a workaround for VC7, which has an internal compiler error
          when the corresponding IDL operation has certain non-void return
          types, i.e., when this return type is declared in the skeleton
          body just before the argument in question. The C++ compiler is
          evidently unable to tell that the argument variable is intialized
          by demarshaling later in the generated skeleton body. Thanks to
          Tim Pullen <tim@timpullen.co.uk> for reporting the problem.

Mon Dec 09 18:11:02 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/OBV/TC_Alignment/server.dsp:
        * tests/OBV/TC_Alignment/client.dsp: Fixed the release build
          configuration.

Mon Dec  9 15:43:38 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_input_eh): Use a cached
          transport id instead of calling id () when printing out
          ACE_DEBUG statements. Thanks to Duane Binder for reporting the
          problem.

Mon Dec  9 14:51:01 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/LF_Connect_Strategy.cpp (wait): Cosmetic fixes to the debug
          statements. Should fix a FMR problem with Purify.

Mon Dec  9 16:33:07 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_Mcast_EH.i:  Added missing
          ACE_INLINE's.

Mon Dec  9 10:26:07 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (recv_i): Fixed a small error in the
          debug  statement. Thanks to Duane Binder for pointing this out.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp: Initialized dscp_codepoint_ in
          the second constructor. This was observed by Ossama, Duane
          Binder and me. I decided to check this in.

Thu Dec  5 20:45:49 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Utilities.cpp (event_debug): Print out the
          debugging info in hex as well as decimal.  Thanks to Oliver Kellog
          <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net> for reporting this.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsLogAdmin.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Fault_Tolerance.dsp:

          Changes to MFC project settings for IDL compilation. Thanks to
          John Morey <jmorey@mmintl.com> for reporting the bugs.

Sat Dec  7 11:59:06 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_Mcast_EH.cpp:  Removed close
          from dtor since it can raise an exception.  This is
          consistent with previous behavior since the user must
          explicitely call close.

Fri Dec  6 21:02:48 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_Mcast_EH.{h,cpp}:  Removed use of
          TAO:Utils:Implicit_Deactivator since it has problems on windows.
          Made dtor exception safe.  Thanks to Bala for pointing this out.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/Makefile:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Performance/Makefile: Removed link to
          libTAO_Utils to pick up Implicit_Deactivator due to windows
          problem cited above.

Fri Dec  6 05:20:28 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_Mcast_EH.{h,i,cpp}: Refactored
          code to properly remove event handlers from the reactor.  This
          included refcounting the event handlers.  Added ifdef for
          ACE_LACKS_PERFECT_MULTICAST_FILTERING so that platforms that
          bind the multicast address by default don't even try to
          join multiple groups on a single socket before adding a new
          socket. Also added a deactivator for the Observer class to
          help simplify deactivation on shutdown and in case of exceptions.
          Thanks to Russ Noseworthy for reporting this.

        * docs/tutorials/Quoter/On_Demand_Activation/index.html:
        * docs/tutorials/Quoter/Simple/Persistent/index.html:  Fixed a
          few minor typos and ommissions in the code sections, along with
          an html formatting problem that showed up with certain browsers.

Wed Dec  4 23:40:31 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp: Old habits die-hard. Made a mistake while
          constructing objects, which basically leads to unspecified
          behaviours on g++, Sunc++ etc. Fixed object construction by
          adding a temporary variable. This should fix most of the
          problems that showed up in our builds.

Wed Dec  4 18:34:21 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Makefile: Added the new test to the list of DIRS.

        * tests/Server_Connection_Purging/svc.conf: Simple test for
          checking whether the handles on the server side are being
          purged. Borland and Win32 files would follow.

Wed Dec  4 17:25:06 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp (update_item) : Return -1 in

Wed Dec  4 12:50:39 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.h:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Added a new method is_finalized ()
          which returns whether the connection handler has reached its
          final state or not.

Wed Dec  4 12:24:52 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/LF_CH_Event.h (TAO_LF_CH_Event): Made the call is_state_final ()
          protected.

Wed Dec  4 12:14:09 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Reactive_Connect_Strategy.cpp: Use the LF_Event's standard
          calls, like keep_waiting (), successful () and error_detected ()
          to wait and collect results, instead of using special calls on
          the connection handler.

Wed Dec 04 07:05:06 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp: Obtain the status
          of the state transformations on the connection handler before
          decrementing the refcount and pass that to the
          post_failed_connect () call.

        * tao/Reactive_Connect_Strategy.h: Did some refactoring of code,
          especially the call to post_failed_connect (). Since all connect
          strategies may require some cleaning up, moved the
          implementation to the base class. Added an argument to the call
          post_failed_connect () to indicate the status of the state
          transformations that occurred on the Connection_Handler.

        * tao/LF_Connect_Strategy.cpp:
        * tao/Reactive_Connect_Strategy.h
        * tao/Reactive_Connect_Strategy.cpp: Implemented the
          post_failed_connect () method  to shutdown the connection
          handler properly for cases that are not taken care by the asynch
          connect process in ACE_Svc_Handler. This fixes a memory leak
          reported by Duane Binder of Veritas. Thanks a lot to Duane
          reporting the problem and teaching me how to reproduce this on
          solaris. I couldnt reproduce this on Win32 and Linux since the
          the TCP stack behaved a bit differently on those platforms.

Tue Dec  3 18:13:42 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        Fix for BUG 1382. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1382

        for details. The problem is basically that we didnt know when and
        how to do reference counting. The following fix addresses
        that.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.inl (TAO_Transport_Refcount_Guard): A new helper
          guard class which increments the refcount when constructed and
          decrements the refcount on destruction.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (process_parsed_messages): Just before
          resuming the handle, increment the refcount of TAO_Transport and
          decrement it when exiting the scope once request and reply
          processing is done.

        * tao/TAO_Server_Request.cpp: Removed incrementing and
          decrementing the TAO_Transport. It has now been moved to
          TAO_Transport::process_parsed_messages () which is a safer and
          the right place to do refcounting. Manipulating refcounts here
          is too late between which world of bad things could strike.

Sat Nov 30 13:38:34 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification_Static.dsp:

          Changes to project settings.

Sat Nov 30 09:38:33 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp: Added a second check after
          holding the lock for the hash map entry in update_item ().

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp: Replicated the changes
          in IIOP to the above protocols. Need to refactor this code.

Fri Nov 29 19:30:20 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connect_Strategy.h:
        * tao/Connect_Strategy.cpp: Added a new method post_failed_connect
          () which could be used to do cleanup if the connect () call
          fails.

        * tao/Blocked_Connect_Strategy.h:
        * tao/Blocked_Connect_Strategy.cpp: Implemented the
          post_failed_connect () method to do cleanup of the svc_handler
          created. Since the blocked connect strategy doesnt use the
          reactor, and hence no handle_close () call if connection
          establishment fails,  we need to employ a seperate mechanism to
          take care of cleanup. This fixes a memory leak.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp: Call post_failed_connect () if the
          connect () call fails.

Fri Nov 29 19:25:59 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp: Prevented the thread doing the server side
          purging from waiting on the LF and waiting for connection
          closure, since its of no use.

Fri Nov 29 18:13:03 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp: Changed to use
          Thread_Manager::task () directly to acquire the task pointer of
          the current thread instead of acquiring it indirectly from the
          Thread_Descriptor since accessing Thread_Descriptor directly is
          no longer allowed.

Fri Nov 29 12:58:00 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/OBV/TC_Alignment/TC_Alignment.dsw:
        * tests/OBV/TC_Alignment/client.dsp:
        * tests/OBV/TC_Alignment/server.dsp:

          Renamed the project files, since the default filename (the same as the
          project name) contained whitespace.

Fri Nov 29 12:31:20 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.dsp:

          Changes to IDL compiler settings for this project.

Fri Nov 29 11:42:45 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp: Cache and idle the
          transport in add_transport_to_cache () instead of just caching
          and leaving the transport in busy state.

Fri Nov 29 11:16:28 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        This set of fixes are for fixing BUG 1247. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1247
        for more details. The problem is that the server side connections
        never got purged. The cache manager was designed to purge
        connections in the client and server end.

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.h:
        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp:
        * tao/transport_cache_manager.inl: Added two new methods,
          cache_idle_transport () and update_entry (). The former
          caches the transport and puts it in the idle and purgable
          state. The latter is useful to update the purge policy
          information.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp: Added a new method update_transport () which
          in turn calls the TAO_Transport_Cache_Manager::update_entry ()
          to update the purging policy information.

          In close_connection_shared (), the connection handler is set in
          a temporary state before waiting on the LF for connection
          closure.

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp (TAO_Connection_Handler):
        * tao/Connection_Handler.h: Added a new method
          connection_close_wait () to set the connection handler in a
          a state which is an intermediate state between SUCESS and
          CONNECTION_CLOSED.

          Added a call to update transport information in handle_output_eh
          () and handle_input_eh (). This is needed for the following
          reasons

            . A connection could be cached by a server thread and the
              connection would be continously used to receive requests. In
              such cases the cache and purging policies should be updated
              to ensure that actively used connections are not purged.

            . In BiDirectional cases, a client thread could cache the
              connection, but the connection could be actively used by a
              server thread. An update is needed to avoid purging the
              connections abruptly.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp: Cache and idle the transport in
          add_transport_to_cache () instead of just caching and leaving
          the transport in busy state.

        * tao/LF_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_CH_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_CH_Event.cpp: Added a new temporary state in the path
          from LFS_SUCCESS to LFS_CONNECTION_CLOSED.

Fri Nov 29 09:56:46 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/OBV/Any/client.cpp:
        * tests/OBV/Any/AnyS_impl.cpp: Fixed compile errors in BCB6
          builds.

Fri Nov 29 08:01:56 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: PortableGroup will not be compiled if
          AMI is disabled.

Fri Nov 29 11:55:41 2002  D A Hanvey  <d.hanvey@qub.ac.uk>

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/Server_Thread_Pool.cpp: Converted the
          usage of ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX to ACE_SYNCH. Missed that
          Message_Queue needs a condition variable in addition to the
          mutex.

Wed Nov 27 13:03:19 2002  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:

          Changed handling of valuetypes to skip a long when skipping the
          valuetype typecode members ValueModifier and Visibility.
          Even though these quanitities are defined as constant short types
          by the spec, the IDL compiler creates typecodes with a hard-coded
          array of longs. Skipping a short can cause an alignment problem depending
          on what comes previously in the CDR stream. Thanks to Pablo d'Angelo
          <pablo@mathematik.uni-ulm.de> for reporting the problem and for
          sending in example code.

        * tests/Bug_1020_Regression/run_test.pl: Fixed these scripts to

Tue Nov 26 00:01:07 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Fix for BUG [1373]. The marshalling and
          demarshalling operators for TAO_opaque objects were
          wrong. Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan for reporting this problem and
          providing a patch.

Mon Nov 25 14:39:00 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ami_pre_proc.cpp:

          Added implied IDL generation for imported (included from another
          IDL file) interfaces. No C++ code is generated for these or any
          other imported nodes in the AST.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup_Static.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.PortableGroup:

          Added IDL compiler command line option to generated AMI code. Also
          added link to TAO Messaging library. These were necessary because some
          of the interfaces in CosLoadBalancing.idl, which already uses AMI,
          inherit from interfaces in PortableGroup.idl, so there must be
          associated reply handlers to inherit as well.

        * TAOACE_Static.dsw:

          Removed some project dependencies that were causing 'already defined'
          link errors.

Mon Nov 25 15:09:50 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

Mon Nov 25 12:25:47 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Forwarder.idl:
          Moved up from subdirectory Notify. Dependencies could not be
          updated correctly due to the idl file in a subdirectory. Thanks
          to Jaroslaw Nozderko <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl> for
          prompting this correction.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.bor:
          Modified to point currectly to Event_Forwarder.idl.

Mon Nov 25 11:38:37 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/RtEC_Based/lib/Makefile: The Makefile was
          by default generating a static library even in dynamic
          builds. Fixed the Makefile to work fine.

Sun Nov 24 12:27:27 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ami_pre_proc.cpp:

          Added check for null result of scoped name lookups in creation of
          inheritance list for reply handlers. Also added a check for each
          possible reply handler parent to determine if it is from an included
          IDL file or not, since the AMI preprocessing visitor does not creeate
          implied IDL for imported nodes. This check may make the first one
          redundant, but it is there anyway for added safety. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@rememdy.nl> and Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com> for
          reporting the bug.

Sun Nov 24 00:21:43 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile*: Made another try in updating
          dependencies again. Thanks to Russ Carter and  Dirk Moermans
          <dirk.moermans@brutele.be> for pointing out the problem.

Sat Nov 23 10:52:28 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp: Cosmetic fixes to the debugging
          statements.

Fri Nov 22 15:30:28 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ami_pre_proc.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_ami_pre_proc.h:

          Fixed the creation of the inheritance list for the implied
          AMI reply handler interface. It now inherits from the
          reply handler of each of the original interface's parents. Thanks
          to Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@atdesk> for pointing out the bug. This closes
          [BUGID:1371].

Fri Nov 22 12:27:27 2002  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/RtEC_Based/lib/Makefile:

Fri Nov 22 04:53:12 2002  Bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 1.2.6 released.

Thu Nov 21 18:45:23 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updates the section on
          Notification Service.
        * docs/releasenotes/notify.html: Added a detailed feature matrix
          of the Cos Notification Service. Thanks to Sharon Caspi
          <sharonc@scopus.net> for suggesting this.


Thu Nov 21 13:26:27 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Avoid checks for reactor consistency
          if the handler is not registered with the reactor. This should
          fix most of the runtime problems that we are seeing. This place
          needs to be reexamined after the beta. The intersection of
          RTCORBA and nonRT cases simply makes this place too
          complicated.

Wed Nov 20 18:04:00 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Muxing/run_test.pl: Checked in a version of the script
          that I use locally by mistake. Reverted the change to the
          original form.

Wed Nov 20 18:01:38 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp (close_connection_eh): Did cosmetic
          changes to the assertive checks.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/ami_cs.cpp
          (gen_marshal_and_invoke):

          Initialize the invocation status variable in the generated stub
          code.  Previously, that variable was uninitialized, which caused
          some invalid code execution paths to occur.  Fixes some problems
          exhibited by TAO's basic AMI regression test.

Wed Nov 20 15:15:02 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/ClientRequestInfo_i.h (setup_picurrent):

          New method that sets up the thread scope and request scope
          PICurrent objects on the client side.

        * tao/ClientRequestInfo_i.cpp (TAO_ClientRequestInfo_i):
          (setup_current):

          Refactored duplicate code in both TAO_ClientRequestInfo_i
          constructors to the new setup_picurrent() method.

          Only set the TSC's peer if a copy was actually performed.  Fixes
          a seg fault after calling
          PortableInterceptor::Current::set_slot() after a client
          invocation was performed.  Thanks to Philipp Leibfried
          <pleibfried@speech-design.de> for providing a test case that
          reproduced this problem.

Wed Nov 20 15:54:10 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception/exception_cs.cpp:

          Changed an internal variable name in generated code for the
          _downcast() method that was short and ran a high risk of name
          clash with the exception typename.

Wed Nov 20 15:23:13 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp (close_connection_eh): Do not do
          comparisions checks for reactor pointers in TAO_Transport,
          TAO_ORB_Core and ACE_Event_handler when the ORB has already
          shutdown. The comparisons could be wrong since the thread that
          is closing it may not have the right access to all the resources
          opened up by other threads (read RTCORBA threads).

Wed Nov 20 16:14:31 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Service.cpp: Added
          ../orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.h so that the static
          initializer can run and add the service objects to the service
          repository.  Thanks to Bala for helping with this.

Wed Nov 20 12:48:35 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/Makefile.bor:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/Structured_Filter_Consumer.dsp
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/Structured_Filter_Supplier.dsp
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Multi_Filter/Structured_Multi_Filter_Consumer.dsp

          Fixed release executable name.

Wed Nov 20 10:26:58 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification_Static.dsp: Fixed path to some
          idl files in the project.

Tue Nov 19 22:32:30 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.cpp (is_collocated):

          Fixed problem where only the first endpoint in an endpoint chain
          was used when determining if an acceptor is collocated despite
          the fact the endpoint chain was "walked" when making this
          determination.

Tue Nov 19 11:02:00 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * Added explaination for each class in
          ChangeLogTag: Sun Oct 27 01:04:09 2002  Pradeep Gore
          <pradeep@oomworks.com>

Mon Nov 18 20:45:12 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Blocking/notify.conf:
          As per Bala's suggestion, applied "-ORBClientConnectionHandler
          RW" hoping to make the blocking work.  Alas, the buffering
          design needs a facelift.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Ordering/run_test.pl
          - Increased allowable period for consumers to run so that test
            doesn't timeout before hand.
          - Commented out priority policy temporarily till the sequences
            implementation of priority ordering is completed.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_ETCL_Filter/Notify_Sequence_Push_Consumer.cpp:
          Removed the MaxEventsPerConsumer policy applied to the
          proxy. That isn't what the test was supposed to excercise.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_ETCL_Filter/Sequence_Consumer.cpp
          Changed OR_OP to AND_OP otherwise the Consumer Admin filter will
          always be true and no events would be rejected.

Mon Nov 18 17:54:41 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp: Cosmetic changes.

Mon Nov 18 14:50:31 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_global.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:

          Added storage and accessors for the AST node
          Components::CCMObject, which is looked up and stored
          if there is at least one component in the IDL file.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ccm_pre_proc.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_ccm_pre_proc.h:

          Added the operations of Components::CCMObject to the operation
          table and *_skel method generation for component equivalent
          interfaces. Thanks to Nanbor <nanbor@cse.wustl.edu> for uncovering
          this bug.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_component/component_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_component/component_sh.h:

          Added conditional generation of AMH classes for component
          equivalent interfaces.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/thru_poa_proxy_impl_sh.cpp:

          Added base component equivalent interface (if any) to the generated
          inheritance list for component equivalent interfaces.

Mon Nov 18 12:11:53 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification_Static.dsp:

          Fixed settings for the IDL files in this project.

Mon Nov 18 13:01:42 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp:
        Commented decrement of <queue_length_> in the svc method.
        This needs to be corrected but at this point all the tests crash
        because of this, so its being taken out temporarily.

Mon Nov 18 11:04:35 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/run_test.pl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Multi_Filter/run_test.pl:
        Appended Structured_ suffix to executable name.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp:
        Reverted thread creation flags.

Mon Nov 18 07:32:10 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event.h: Work around for a weird BCB6
          compiler bug. Thanks to Chris Kohlhoff for helping me with this.

Mon Nov 18 07:28:16 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/AMI/Makefile: Prevent the contents

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/RTCORBA_*:
          Removed extraneous files.

Sun Nov 17 12:05:20 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/Makefile.bor: Added AMI test to the
          list of tests that needs compilation. Thanks to Johnny for
          pointing this out.

Sun Nov 17 09:37:08 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

Sat Nov 16 21:09:32 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/Makefile: Added AMI test to the list
          of tests that needs compilation.

Sat Nov 16 20:43:21 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * */Makefile: Updated dependency.

Sat Nov 16 20:11:13 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp:
          - Modified threadpool creation flags to ACE_Task::activate.
          - Corrected decrement of <queue_length_>.

Fri Nov 15 15:29:24 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/run_test.pl:
          Modified to run the basic tests with a reactive and
          multithreaded Notification.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/notify.mt.conf:
          Added MT conf for the Basic test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/notify.reactive.conf:
          Added reactive conf for the Basic test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Blocking/notify.conf:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/listener.conf
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/lookup.conf
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/reactive.conf
        * orbsvcs/logging_service/notify_logging_service/svc.conf:
        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/svc.conf: Reverted factory back to
          Notify_Default_Event_Manager_Objects_Factory. I have decided not
          to introduce any changes for Notify Options in TAO 1.3. Better
          replacements will be introduced gradually in subsequent
          releases.

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Server.cpp:
          Not handling signals. The shutdown code and event handler is
          maintained in case we want to address this in the future.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/run_test.pl:
          - Modified to run all 3 test cases described in the README.
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Notify_Structured_Push_Consumer.cpp:
          Changed hardcoded "10" to the expected number of events that can
          be specified on the command line.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Sequence_Consumer.cpp:
          - Changed low=2 and high=20. Here is the explanation:
          The Supplier sends 96 events as 6 batches of 16 events.
          The Notification is run with 1 dispatching thread. The Discarding
          Policy is set and the MaxEventsPerConsumer is set to 2 (Event
          Batches).The Batch size is 5 so the maximum batches that can be
          received is 20 (19 batches with 5 events each and 1 batch with 1
          event).if we receive 20 batches then the channel
          hasn't discarded anything. so high = 20. In the worst case the
          consumer starts *after* the supplier has send all the events to
          the Notification. This means that only 2 batches are queued and
          all others are discarded. Hence low = 2.

          - Changed the sleep time that the consumer was polling fior
          excess events, from 3 to 1 sec. otherwise the perl script was
          timing out.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Ordering/Notify_Sequence_Push_Consumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Ordering/Notify_Sequence_Push_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Ordering/Sequence_Consumer.cpp:
          Removed high-low logic. There is *no* discarding policy set so
          the Sequence Consumer should received the expected number of 96 events.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Filter/Sequence_Consumer.cpp:
          - Changed ConsumerAdmin interfilter operator to AND_OP. With an
          OR_OP, all the filters would return true! this is because the
          filters of the Admin and Proxy, both are combined to determine event
          eligibility. Note that this test success/failure has to be
          determined visually.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/listener.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/lookup.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/reactive.conf:
          Reverted to Notify_Default_Event_Manager_Objects_Factory for
          backward compatibility.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/Structured_Filter_Consumer.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/Structured_Filter_Supplier.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/Structured_Multi_Filter_Consumer.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/Structured_Multi_Filter_Supplier.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Filter/run_test.pl:
          Reverted executable name to Structured_* prefix.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.cpp:
          Discarding condition should be executed when buffering limit has
          reached. Current logic was enqueing 1 extra event.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Builder.cpp:
          Added call to set default startup QoS options on the Proxys and Admins.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Service.h:
          - Added support for configuring startup threads at the proxy and
            Admin level while maintaining backward compatibility.
          - Modified updates logic - Updates are send synchronously by
          default. If the -AsynchUpdates option is set, updates are queued along
          with the regular events in the Proxy objects worker task.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Properties.inl:
          Added get/set methods for Proxy and Admin level default QoS.
          Changed <updates> to <asynch_updates> flag.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Property_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Property_T.inl:
        - Added assignment operator to TAO_NS_Property_T.
        - Added an <invalidate> method to TAO_NS_PropertyBase_T

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Proxy.cpp:
        - Send updates synchronously unless default properties mandate
          asynchrony. In that case the event is executed in the current
          thread context.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/CosEC_ProxyPushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushConsumer.h:
          Added dummy methods and ACE_ASSERT in them if called.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/EventBatch.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/EventBatch.inl:
          Added an accessor for the current size of the EventBatch.
          Note that this size can be greater than the batchsize.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushSupplier.h:
          Overloaded ProxyPushSupplier::push method.
          The overloaded implementation executes the filtering and
          dispatch in the current thread context. Now, this dispatch
          doesn't immediately go remote but is stored in an event batch
          waiting for the pacing interval to expire after which the
          batchsize events are queued in the SequenceProxy's worker thread
          to be finally dispatched to the remote consumer.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.h:
          Removed <dispatch_immediate> and <cancel_timer> methods.
          There was no need for these seperate methods.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
          Modified the implementation so that the Pacing Timer is deployed
          only if there is atleast 1 event queued to send, otherwise the
          existing timer is removed. This will avoid needless timeouts.

Sat Nov 16 08:22:38 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/CosEC_ProxyPushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushConsumer.h: Fixed typos that
          lead to link errors.

        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.cpp: Fixed a warning in the daily
          builds.

Sat Nov 16 12:43:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/server.bor:
          Fixes error in this BCB makefile.

Fri Nov 15 18:29:28 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Random.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Random.cpp (next_member):
          (_tao_next_member):

          Refactored random member selection code into a TAO-specific
          static method.  This is possible since this random load
          balancing strategy implementation is stateless.  This allows
          other strategies to reuse the random member selection code
          without instantiating the TAO_LB_Random class.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LeastLoaded.cpp (next_member):

          No loads have been reported for any of the locations the object
          group members reside at.  If no loads have been reported to the
          LoadManager, adaptive load balancing decisions cannot be made.
          Fall back on a non-adaptive strategy, such as the Random load
          balancing strategy, instead.  The Random load balancing strategy
          is used since it is very lightweight and stateless.

Fri Nov 15 15:26:29 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/Basic.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/LB_server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/server.cpp:

          Corrected ACE_RCSID macros.  They listed the wrong directory.

Fri Nov 15 15:13:20 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/Signal_Handler.cpp (activate):

          sigwait() is not supported on MS Windows, meaning that signals
          cannot be handled synchronously with the current implementation
          of this signal handler.  Handle signals asynchronously through
          the ORB's reactor instead.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LoadManager.cpp (init):

          Fixed buffer overrun problem that was causing an unhandled
          exception to be thrown on MS Windows.  The hexidecimal
          representation of the time in milliseconds was supposed to be
          embedded in a string buffer of 8 characters.  The decimal
          representation, which is greater than 8 characters long, was
          being embedded into the string instead.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Component.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_Component.cpp:

          Cosmetic and spelling fixes/updates.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_IORInterceptor.h:

          CORBA::SystemException, not CORBA_SystemException.

Fri Nov 15 16:59:49 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/CosEC_ProxyPushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushConsumer.h: Fixed warnings
          in Borland build.

Fri Nov 15 15:22:54 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ccm_pre_proc.cpp:

          Added check to skip implied IDL generation for imported nodes.
          Thanks once again to Nanbor <nanbor@cse.wustl.edu> for his
          testing of the new CCM-related IDL features.

Fri Nov 15 14:51:31 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.cpp:
        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp:
        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
        * tao/Queued_Message.h: Added an extra default argument to the
          constructor that indicates whether the class is heap allocated
          or not.

        * tao/Transport.cpp: Changed the places where the
          Asynch_Queued_Message was allocated on the heap to pass the
          right value for the flag that indicates the status of creation
          of the class.

          Thanks to Chad Elliott for pinting out that if the
          Asynch_Queued_Message was allocated on the heap, it may not get
          destroyed if TAO_Asynch_Queued_Message::destroy () was
          called.

Fri Nov 15 20:52:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Event_Map_T.h:
          Added missing include to fix BCB compile error.

        * tests/Bug_1020_Basic_Regression/*.bor:
        * tests/Bug_1020_Regression/*.bor:
        * tests/Bug_1269_Regression/*.bor:
        * tests/Bug_1270_Regression/*.bor:
          Added new BCB makefiles to build these tests

        * tests/Makefile.bor:
          Added new tests for which there are now BCB makefiles.

Fri Nov 15 11:06:07 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosLoadBalancing.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosLoadBalancing_Static.dsp:

          Added LB_Client_{Component,ORBInitalizer}.{h,cpp} files to these
          project files.

Fri Nov 15 10:51:04 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_component/component_cs.cpp:

          Changed the signature of the global <flat name>_upcast() method for
          components, used by sequences containing forward declared
          components. Thanks again to Nanbor <nanbor@cse.wustl.edu> for
          confirming my suspicion.

Fri Nov 15 09:29:31 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_component/component_ch.cpp:

          Fixed up some omissions and signatures in generated code. Thanks to
          Nanbor <nanbor@cse.wustl.edu> for uncovering them.

Thu Nov 14 19:45:18 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsLogAdmin.dsp: Added required paths to the
          libraries.

Thu Nov 14 16:40:06 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/LoadMonitor.cpp (usage):
        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/LoadManager.cpp (usage):

          Clarified usage message.

          (parse_args):

          If the "-h" command line option was supplied, print the usage
          message and exit immediately.  Previously, the usage message was
          printed but the executable never exited.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_ClientComponent.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_ClientComponent.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_ClientORBInitializer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_ClientORBInitializer.cpp:

          New sources that transparently add adaptive load balancing
          support to a client.  They are used to transparently register
          the existing LB_ClientRequestInterceptor.  This part of a set of
          changes that enable the adaptive load balancing support in
          Cygnus, i.e. TAO's new load balancer.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LeastLoaded.cpp (get_location):

          Fixed problem where CosLoadBalancing::LocationNotFound exception
          was propagated to the client, and interpreted as a
          CORBA::UNKNOWN exception.  If loads at the supplied location
          are not available continue the loop and attempt to retrieve
          loads from the next location.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_LoadManager.cpp
          (built_in_strategy):

          Corrected debugging statement.

Thu Nov 14 16:35:45 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Makefile: Added new tests to the daily builds.

Thu Nov 14 16:28:13 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Bug_1269_Regression/run_test.pl:
        * tests/Bug_1270_Regression/run_test.pl: Reduced the runtime
          further to 4 minutes. 7 minutes is too high to blow away the
          stack on machines like charanga!

Thu Nov 14 16:21:58 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Bug_1270_Regression/run_test.pl: Reduced the runtime from
          70 minutes to 7 minutes. This will make them usable in the daily
          builds.

Thu Nov 14 13:47:10 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/ami_cs.cpp
          (gen_marshal_and_invoke):

          Fixed "empty controlled statment" warning that occurred due to
          an ACE_ASSERT disappearing when NDEBUG is defined.  That
          ACE_ASSERT is to be executed when a oneway operation check
          evaluates to true.  When NDEBUG is defined, there is nothing to
          execute if that condition is true.  Moved the condition check
          inside the ACE_ASSERT.  This is safe since no other code is
          meant to be run if the oneway operation check/condition is
          true, i.e. there are no side-effects.

Thu Nov 14 14:33:21 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp: Changed the semantics of one of the arguments
          in the call close_connection_shared (). The argument was called
          "disable_purge" and was used in exactly the opposite manner. The
          condition that was used to purge the entry from the cache was
          also topsy-turvy.

          This was fixed the following way

            - the argument is now called "purge".
            - a value of 1 will purge the entry from the cache manager and
              a value of 0 otherwise.

          This should fix the failure of the Crash_On_Write test in our
          daily builds. The same problem seems to have been reported by
          Christophe Vedel <cv@validy.com> in different context, BUG
          1299.

Thu Nov 14 14:04:27 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV.dsp:

          Added missing dependency to project.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsLogAdmin.dsp:

          Added missing link paths to release version.

Thu Nov 14 10:55:01 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/AMI/Server_Interceptor.cpp
          (send_reply, send_exception):

          Fixed unused argument warning in emulated exceptions case.

Thu Nov 14 10:04:52 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/AMI/client.cpp (test_ami):
          (test_ami_errors):

          Use a PortableServer::ServantBase_var instead of a
          TAO::Utils::Servant_var.  MSVC++ 6 can't handle the member
          templates in the latter.

Thu Nov 14 11:48:31 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.bor: Added a wild card character
          to the list of files to be compiled.

Thu Nov 14 09:43:40 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/AMI/server.dsp:

          Corrected library path for the TAO_Messaging library.

Wed Nov 13 17:18:35 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Release the OS resources only when
          the reference count reaches zero. There may be lot of
          furore over this decision. But doing this would help to
          circumvent BUG 1294 and BUG 1361. The solution in BUG 1294, is
          not scalable to situations explained in BUG 1361 which leads to
          crashes. The only way to circumvent that is to release the OS
          resources at the end of the lifetime of the handler.

          Not exactly sure how I missed this yesterday.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Accept_Strategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Accept_Strategy.cpp:

          New TAO_SSLIOP-specific TAO_Accept_Strategy implementation.
          This accept strategy builds on on the TAO_Accept_Strategy
          implementation.  It sub-classes that class, and overrides the
          accept_svc_handler() method so that a timeout value may be
          passed to the underlying peer acceptor.  This is necessary to
          defend against a simple Denial-of-Service attack.  See the
          comments in the header for details.  [Bug 1348]

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Factory.cpp (init):

          Added new "-SSLAcceptTimeout" option.  This option allows
          applications to override the default 10 second TAO_SSLIOP
          accept() timeout.

          (make_acceptor):

          Pass the timeout value to the SSLIOP_Acceptor's constructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Acceptor.h:

          Updated use the new TAO_SSLIOP_Accept_Strategy implementation
          instead of the generic one supplied by TAO.  [Bug 1348]

          Cache the accept timeout value in a member variable.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Acceptor.cpp
          (TAO_SSLIOP_Acceptor):

          Initialize the accept timeout member from the value passed to
          this constructor from the SSLIOP_Factory.

          (ssliop_open_i):

          Pass the accept timeout value to the
          TAO_SSLIOP_Accept_Strategy's constructor.  [Bug 1348]

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp (ssliop_connect):

          Only register the connection handler with the reactor when
          creating a new connection.  Previously, the connection handler
          was registered each time an invocation was made even if a
          connection was previously established.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Secure_Invocation/client.bor (TAO_IDL):
        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Secure_Invocation/server.bor (TAO_IDL):

          Removed "-GC" option from the TAO_IDL flags.  This test does not
          require AMI callbacks.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp: Fixed a compile
          error.

Tue Nov 12 14:34:37 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp: Fixed unused
          variable warnings in builds compiled with ACE_NDEBUG option
          turned on. This makes the ACE_ASSERT dissappear.

Tue Nov 12 13:25:00 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/LF_CH_Event.cpp: Fixed compile error in no inline builds.

        * tao/LF_Invocation_Event.inl: Fixed a typo.

Tue Nov 12 12:47:31 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        Fix for [BUG 1020]. Please see details of the bug at

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1020

        Please see the discussions in the above URL for details on
        the motivations for these changes. A very brief summary of the
        changes alone are mentioned.

        * tao/Transport.cpp(close_connection_shared): Wait on the
          leader follower if the handle is registered with the
          reactor.

        * tao/LF_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_Event.cpp:
        * tao/LF_Event.inl: Made the class TAO_LF_Event as an abstract
          base class. This helps us to strategize the type of
          behaviour required in different concrete classes which can
          in turn be used by other portions of the ORB to wait on LF.

        * tao/LF_Invocation_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_Invocation_Event.cpp:
        * tao/LF_Invocation_Event.inl: Concrete implementation of a
          LF_Event class, where the state transitions along the invocation
          path are consolidated.

        * tao/LF_CH_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_CH_Event.cpp: Concrete implementation of a LF_Event
          class, where the state transitions of the connection handler are
          consolidated.

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Synch_Reply_Dispatcher.h: They now inherit from
          TAO_LF_Invocation_Event class.

        * tao/Connection_Handler.h: This class inherits now from the
          TAO_LF_CH_Event class.

        * tao/Makefile.bor:
        * tao/Makefile.tao: Added the new files to the list of compilable
          files.

Tue Nov 12 12:37:18 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/examples/Log/Notify/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/examples/Log/Notify/Notify_Consumer.h:
          Removed the include of
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_EventChannel_i.h, which no longer exists.

Tue Nov 12 11:15:50 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp: Added an assert
          statement after decrementing the reference count. Point taken
          from "Pragmatic Programmer".

Tue Nov 12 11:08:32 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.h: Commented out the following calls
          incr_pending_upcalls (), decr_pending_upcalls () and
          pending_upcalls (), since there was no implementation and they
          were not at all used.

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Cosmetic changes.

Tue Nov 12 10:17:05 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/NotifyLogNotification.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/NotifyLog_i.h:

          Removed the include of
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_EventChannel_i.h, which no longer exists.

Tue Nov 12 13:31:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Profile.cpp:
          Made the argument of addressing_mode() same as in header file so that
          doxygen documentation is generated for this method.

Mon Nov 11 23:04:34 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/Application_Controlled.dsw:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/client.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/server.dsp:

          New MSVC++ 6 project files for this test.

Mon Nov 11 22:33:37 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/Makefile (TAO_LB_LIBS):

          Corrected order of libraries linked to the server binary.

          (client):

          Do not link server-side libraries.  They are completely
          unnecessary for this client binary.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile.bor (DIRS):

          Added "LoadBalancing" directory to the list of directories to
          recurse into.

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/Makefile.bor:
        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Makefile.bor:

          New Borland C++ Makefiles for this test.

Mon Nov 11 20:31:18 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/LoadManager.cpp (TAO_LB_run_load_manager):
        * orbsvcs/LoadBalancer/LoadMonitor.cpp (TAO_LB_run_load_monitor):

          New global function that is run when the Load{Manager,Monitor}'s
          ORB thread is run.  It is only used on Linux when multi-thread
          support is enabled.  This is part of a work-around for the
          problem where signals can only be handled in the main() thread
          on Linux.

          (ACE_TMAIN):

          Spawn a new thread to run the LoadManager's ORB, and handle
          signals in this (main()) thread.  This is the second part of a
          work-around for the problem where signals can only be handled in
          the main() thread on Linux.

          Moved signal handler activation to just before the point where
          the ORB is run.  There is no need to activate the signal handler
          earlier than there.

Mon Nov 11 19:22:05 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/LoadBalancing/LB_ObjectReferenceFactory.h:

          Explicitly include "ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h" to pull in
          ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex template.

          New MSVC++ project files for this test.

Mon Nov 11 18:03:37 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * docs/interceptors.html:

          Updated release notes about AMI interceptor support.

          Updated CORBA spec URL to the 3.0.1 spec's URL.

        * tao/Messaging/Makefile.bor:
        * tao/Messaging/TAO_Messaging.dsp:
        * tao/Messaging/TAO_Messaging_Static.dsp:

          Added AMI_ClientRequestInfo_i.{h,cpp} to these Make/project
          files.

          Add implementation class for AMI ClientRequestInfos.  [Bug 286]

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          Move some #includes to the .cpp file, include
          AMI_ClientRequestInfo_i.h when compiling with interceptors and
          AMI.    [Bug 286]

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Peer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Peer.inl:
          - Added a <dispatch_updates> method that formats the event types
          for final dispatch.
          - Added a <handle_dispatch_exception> method that simply
          destroys the offending Peer.
          - Modified <dispatch_updates_i> to accept

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxyConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxyConsumer.h:
           - Added calls to <connect>, <disconnect> and <offer_change>
          instead of calling <publish> and <un_publish>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Updates.inl:
          Added a Method Request type that sends dispatch_updates to Peer
          objects. Updates are also treated as events and
          enqueued/dequeued in a queue(if any) of the Worker Task.
          This replaces the earlier logic of using Pending_Worker.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Events.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Events.h:
          - Added a -use_default_admin option that results in the test

        - Added this test to check the following -
          + Consumers of different types should receive events
          that are send by any kind of supplier.
          + A nested upcall to the Notification Service via a
          disconnect_XXX from within a push should succeed.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Updates.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Updates.h:
          Completely revamped this test. This test tests subscription and

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp (consolidate_fragments): When growing
          the message block to increase the allocated memory, we now use
          the length () of the available message block as the basis for
          growing instead of the size (). Simon McQueen of PrismTech ran
          several experiments while investigating problems related to
          [BUGID 1356] and is convinced this is the right way to go, since
          this uses less memory. Since I dont foresee problems, his patch
          is being accepted for the release. Thanks to Simon for putting
          in lot of effort to narrow down the problem to this area.

Mon Nov 11 10:43:59 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service.dsp:
          Added TAO_CosEvent.lib to the list of libraries for Release
          build only to fix a link problem on MSVC.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Log/Basic_Log_Test/Basic_Log_Test.cpp
          (write_records): Initialize the local variable <l> to 0 to fix a
          build warning.

Mon Nov 11 09:28:43 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Locator_i.cpp:
          Get the whole hostname name including the domain instead
          of just the hostname.
          Thanks to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi@mivzak.com> for pointing
          out a exception thats raised.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/run_test.pl:

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor.h:
        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor_exception.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor_exception.h:

          Changed handling of reopened modules. In the case where a
          module and its member have both been seen before, tao_ifr
          now assumes that it is re-processing the IDL file in which
          the module and member were first seen, and ignores the member.
          It is possible that there is actually an illegal name clash, but
          it is not possible to tell the difference in every case, so we
          choose the behavior assuming that the common case will be the
          re-processing of an already-loaded IDL file. Thanks to Nick
          Cross <nick.cross@prismtechnologies.com> for reporting the
          problem when loading CosNaming.idl twice and then trying to
          look at the IFR contents.

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor_structure.cpp:

          Cosmetic changes.

Sun Nov 10 18:02:51 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

          with previous patch, Wed Oct 16 17:16:38 2002  Jeff Parsons
          <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>, where the logic was
          reversed.  Thanks to Jon Franklin for noticing the problem and
          providing the patch.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp: Some debugging statements were
          either out of format or totally useless for any debugging
          purposes. Fixed some of them that I saw in the path that
          actually hinders my debugging.

Sat Nov 09 09:47:37 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Bug_1020_Regression: Another test that has the capability
          of stressing things a bit more for this bug to show up. This
          test is structured in such a manner that multipel Multi-threaded
          clients can connect to a server. The clients crash at periodic
          intervals. This is a slightly improvised form of the basic

Sun Nov  3 15:59:57 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        The following fix some problems with the infrastructure-controlled
        membership support in TAO's PortableGroup library:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Factory_Set.h
          (TAO_PG_Factory_Node):

          Replaced GenericFactory object reference attribute with a
          FactoryInfo attribute.  The latter is necessary to correctly
          implement infrastructure-controlled membership

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.h
          (delete_member):

          New method used to implement the
          ObjectGroupManager::remove_member() method when the object group
          in question is under infrastructure control.  The
          ObjectGroupManager will call back on the GenericFactory.

          (check_minimum_number_members):

          New method that creates new members if the object group in
          question is under infrastructure control.  Enough new members
          will be created to satisfy the MinimumNumberMembers property of
          the object group (assuming there are enough unused
          application-supplied GenericFactorys).

          (create_member):

          New method used to create a single member via the
          infrastructure.  This method is only used internally by the
          infrastructure.  It should not be confused with the
          ObjectGroupManager::create_member() method.

          (populate_object_group):

          Removed FactoryCreationId and ObjectId parameters.  They are no
          longer used by this method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.cpp:

          No need to include `PG_Group_Guard.h'.  That file has been
          removed.

          (TAO_PG_GenericFactory):

          Pass the "this" pointer to the ObjectGroupManager
          implementation.  The ObjectGroupManager will potentially call
          back on the GenericFactory in the infrastructure-controlled
          membership case.

          (create_object):

          Reorganized this method so that the TAO_PG_Group_Guard class is
          no longer needed.  In particular, the FactoryCreationId is

          The object group's factory set is now bound to the factory map
          in this method instead of the populate_object_group() method.
          This allowed the latter method to be cleaned up.

          (delete_object_i):

          Updated to access FactoryInfo field in the TAO_PG_Factory_Node
          structure that replaced the old GenericFactory object reference
          field.

          (populate_object_group):

          Fixed problem where only the number of factories equal to the
          initial number of members were bound to the factory map.  All
          factories should be bound to the map, but only
          InitialNumberMembers factories should be invoked.

          Refactored member creation code to the new create_member()
          method since the same code is also used by the new
          check_minimum_number_members() method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Group_Guard.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Group_Guard.cpp:

          Remove these files.  The "guard" implementation contained in
          these files is no longer necessary due to improvements in the
          TAO_PG_GenericFactory::create_object() method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_ObjectGroupManager.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_ObjectGroupManager.cpp
          (_tao_add_member):

          TAO-specific object group member addition method intended for
          use by TAO's GenericFactory implementation.  It merely calls the
          new protected add_member_i() method in a way that prevents that
          method from performing remote member type checking via the
          CORBA::Object::_is_a() call.  TAO's GenericFactory
          implementation already performs member type checking in the
          infrastructure-controlled case.  This is an optimization to
          prevent redundant remote type checks.

          (add_member):

          Refactored object group member addition code to the new
          protected add_member_i() method.  It calls the add_member_i()
          method in a way that allows member type checking to occur.

          (add_member_i):

          New protected underlying and non-locking implementation of the
          add_member() and _tao_add_member() methods.

          (member_count):

          New accessor method that returns the number of members currently
          in a given object group.  Used by the new
          TAO_PG_GenericFactory::check_minimum_number_members() method.

          (generic_factory):

          Mutator method used to set the cached pointer to the
          TAO_PG_GenericFactory object which the TAO_PG_ObjectGroupManager
          will call back on.

Sun Nov 03 11:00:27 2002  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.bor:
          Added missing .obj extension to targets. Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing this out.

        * orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Server.cpp:
          Removed calls to initalize old Notification factories. This is
          not needed now.

          cannot run these, since they run for more than 75 mins on my two

          Removed ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIORITY to threadpool task. Thanks
          to Bala for suggesting a fix.

        * orbscvs/orbsvcs/Notify/Thread_Pool_Task.cpp:
          Modified call to <activate> to use ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIORITY.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp (connect):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.h: Added the overloaded
          connect () method without the timeout. The implementation just
          calls the method with timeout value. It shouldnt be necessary,
          but one build in the borland compiler warns about one of the
          connect () methods hiding the other one. Hopefully, this should
          resolve the warning.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp (handle_timeout): Fixed
          a stupid typo :(

Thu Oct 31 14:48:39 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        This is a fix for BUGID 1284. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1284 for more
        details. This fix does the following

        - The invocation class selects a timeout from the two options that
          it has access to, viz. a user defined timeouts for connection
          establishment or the roundtrip timeout defined by the user.

        - If the user defined connection timeout policy is used and if the
          call to TAO_Transport::connect () returns an errno of ETIME, the
          invocation class tries the next endpoint in the profile.

        - If the roundtrip timeout is used, we raise a CORBA::TIMEOUT
          exception.

        The connection timeout policy if set, overrides the roundtrip
        timeout policy value. To get the semantics right, the following
        changes were performed:

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Transport_Connector.h: Added another connect () method with
          a timeout value. Made the connect () methods non-pure-virtual,
          such that we could share some code and maintain backward
          compatibility. Further, the pure-virtual method make_connection
          () passes a timeout value. This shouldnt break backward
          compatibility either.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Connector.h: Added a timeout argument to the
          make_connection () method. This method gets called from
          TAO_Connector::connect () method which has a timeout. The
          implementation of the make_connection () method is now changed
          to just use the timeout value that is passed instead of
          selecting a timeout value.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Selects a timeout from the two possible
          alternatives and passes one of the values to the connect ()
          call. Based on the timeout value used and the return value
          handles errors as explained above.

        * tao/Strategies/DIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/DIOP_Connector.h:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connector.h:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connector.h: Changes to the protocols within
          TAO. Changes to other protocols will follow.

          out.

Wed Oct 30 09:01:12 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServer_ORBInitializer.cpp
          (register_poa_current):

          Removed obsolete/incorrect comment regarding the lack of
          reference counting in the TAO_ORBInitInfo object.
          TAO_ORBInitInfo is now properly reference counted.

Wed Oct 30 11:38:36 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * Following are fixes for bug 1344.  Thanks to Ossama for pointing
          this out.

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp (create): Moved the
          registration of the POA Current to the
          PortableServer_ORBInitializer.  If POA Current is resolved
          before RootPOA, this code executes does not execute in time.

        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServer_ORBInitializer.cpp
          (register_poa_current): POA Current is now registered in
          TAO_PortableServer_ORBInitializer::post_init().

        * tao/ORB_Core.i (poa_current): Simply return <poa_current>.  It
          should have been correctly initialized.

        * tests/POA/Current: Added new test to ensure that accessing the
          POA current before the RootPOA does not cause any problems.

          The following files were added:

          - tests/POA/Current/Current.cpp
          - tests/POA/Current/Current.dsp

Tue Oct 29 17:50:59 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Singleton_Manager.cpp (fini, _set_unexpected):

          Call set_unexpected() in the global namespace when using
          MSVC++.  MSVC++ doesn't place set_unexpected() in the "std"
          namespace.  Thanks to Irfan for pointing the build problem.

Tue Oct 29 19:20:29 2002  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Service.h:

          placed in the target's dependency list.  Addresses several build
          errors.

Tue Oct 29 07:38:44 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_MT_Mcast/Makefile.bor:
          Added new BCB makefile for this test.

Mon Oct 28 22:11:12 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Singleton_Manager.cpp:

          Do not pull the std::unexpected() function into the global
          namespace through a "using" clause to avoid a conflict with some
          STL implementations (e.g. STLPort) that already do that.

          (init, _set_unexpected):

          If the compiler's C++ library defines the "std" namespace,
          explicitly call std::set_unexpected.  This fix was motivated by
          Kobi Cohen Arazi <kobi@mivzak.com>.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Admin.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ConsumerAdmin.cpp:

          Made the TAO_NS_Object_Id_Seq definition public so it can be
          accessed from other classes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:

          Put the pacing_interval_.value () into an ACE_Time_Value before
          checking with ACE_Time_Value::zero.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Factory.cpp:

          Removed duplicate template instantitaion of TAO_NS_EventType.

Mon Oct 28 17:19:58 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * tests/POA/MT_Servant_Locator/MT_Servant_Locator.cpp: Fixed
          ACE_ENV warnings.

Mon Oct 28 16:55:11 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * tests/POA/MT_Servant_Locator/Makefile: Fixed and updated
          dependencies.

Mon Oct 28 16:48:23 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * tests/POA/MT_Servant_Locator/MT_Servant_Locator.cpp: <Task::event_>
          was being used in both preinvoke() and postinvoke().  This led
          to a deadlock if the second signal() was missed since the event
          was already signaled. Solution was to give both preinvoke() and
          postinvoke() their own event variables.

Mon Oct 28 14:20:32 2002  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * tao/PortableServer/POA.cpp (locate_servant_i): We no longer
          need to use the non-servant upcall idiom for calling
          ServantLocator::preinvoke() since we are now let of the lock
          altogether before calling the servant locator.
          ServantLocator::postinvoke() is also handled in a similar
          manner.

          Note that it is possible for some other thread to reset the
          servant locator once the lock is released.  However, this
          possiblility also exists for postinvoke() which is also called
          outside the lock.

          Thanks to Ashok Sadasivan <ashok_sadasivan@hotmail.com> for
          pointing this out.

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp (prepare_for_upcall):
          Check the state before releasing the lock since it may already
          have been released for Servant Locators.

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter: Moved State enumeration from
          protected to public section.  Also added accessor and set method
          of the state.

        * tests/POA/MT_Servant_Locator: Added new test to ensure that the
          POA allows multiple simultaneous calls to Servant Locators.

        * Following are fixes for bug 1317.  Thanks to Ossama for pointing
          this out.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (open_services_i): If available, allow the
          Adapter Factory to setup by calling init().  This is similar to

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (poa_factory_name): Added accessor.

        * tao/RTPortableServer/RT_Object_Adapter_Factory.h: Changed
          inheritance from TAO_Adapter_Factory to

          unique id's for *each* category of Objects. so
          e.g. ConsumerAdmins went from 0,1,2... and ProxySuppliers went
          from 0,1,2... Now ConsumerAdmins and ProxySuppliers would share
          Id's 0,1,2... 3,4,5. The spec. requires Ids to be unique, It
          does not require each category to be unique. moreover

Fri Oct 25 21:48:30 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/PortableServer/POA.cpp (adapter_name_i):

          Fixed problem where the RootPOA's adapter name was not included
          in the returned adapter name sequence.  CORBA 3.0 requires it to
          be included.

          Fixed incorrect nil POA reference check.  Use
          "CORBA::is_nil(poa)" instead of
          "poa == PortableServer::POA::_nil()".

          Slightly optimized and cleaned up this method.

        * tests/ORT/ObjectReferenceFactory.idl:
        * tests/ORT/ObjectReferenceFactory.h:
        * tests/ORT/ObjectReferenceFactory.cpp:

          New PortableInterceptor::ObjectReferenceFactory implementation
          designed to excerise the
          PortableInterceptor::IORInfo::current_factory() attributed, the
          POA's ObjectReferenceFactory support.

        * tests/ORT/ServerORBInitializer.h:
        * tests/ORT/ServerORBInitializer.cpp:

          New server side ORBInitializer that registers the new server
          request interceptor and the existing IOR interceptor.

        * tests/ORT/ServerRequestInterceptor.h:
        * tests/ORT/ServerRequestInterceptor.cpp:

          New server request interceptor thats tests some of the
          ORT-specific methods in the ServerRequestInfo object passed to
          the server request interception points.

        * tests/ORT/ORT_test_IORInterceptor.cpp (components_established):

          Swap out the current ObjectReferenceFactory with the customized
          ObjectReferenceFactory implemented by this test.  The goal is
          test the PortableInterceptor::IORInfo::current_factory attribute
          internals, in addition to the POA's
          PortableInterceptor::ObjectReferenceFactory support.

        * tests/ORT/server.cpp (main):

          Use a child POA when activating the servant and obtaining an
          object reference for it.  This forces a POA hierarchy to be
          reflected in the AdapterName sequence returned from
          PortableInterceptor::ServerRequestInfo::adapter_name() instead
          of a single (root) POA.

          Removed TAO-specific calls on the TAO_ORB_Core.  The
          equivalent portable calls in the
          PortableInterceptor::ServerRequestInfo object will be invoked
          via the new ServerRequestInterceptor instead.

        * tests/ORT/ORT_test_IORInterceptor_ORBInitializer.h:
        * tests/ORT/ORT_test_IORInterceptor_ORBInitializer.cpp:

          Removed this ORBInitializer in favor of the new one described

        * tests/ORT/ORT_test.idl:

        * tests/ORT/server.bor:
        * tests/ORT/server.dsp:

          Added new files and removed deprecated ones.

          is referenced.

          Converted many occurrences of a string literal arg to the typedef name

          IDL compiler generates in the method signature.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trading_Loader.cpp:

          Same as above for two overlooked occurrences of a string literal where

          Modified code generation to generate the typedef name for
          typedef'd strings, along with the typedef name for the
          corresponding _var and _out classes, when used in operation
          parameters and inside generated function bodies. Generated
          constructors for exceptions with typedef'd string members
          were not changed - there seems to be no way to make happy
          all the compilers we support. Thanks to Goran Stojsic
          <goran.stojsic@etk.ericsson.se> for pointing out that
          generating char* for typedef'd strings in operations
          parameters will prevent the application from using the
          typedef name, since the compiler will report that a pure
          virtual skeleton method was not overridden in such a case.
          This fix will probably cause numerous headaches, but it is
          the Right Thing (TM) to do, so the problems will be dealt
          with as they appear.

        * tao/Transport.h: Changes to the ORB Core. The details are as
          follows

          - It eliminates the two refcounts in the connection handler and
            combines as one refcount.

          - The transport_ field in the Connection_Handler class is
            atomically modified.

          - Closing connections are also atomic.

          - When the connection is closed all the activations in the
            reactor are removed.

          For all the other gory details like the motivation for these
          changes, it is advised you refer to BUGID's 1202, 1269 and
          1270.

Mon Oct 21 14:27:44 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/DLL_ORB/Makefile.Test_Client_Module:
        * tests/DLL_ORB/Makefile.Test_Server_Module: Fix for the makefile
          problem that lead to a link being created for a library that
          didnt exist. Thaks to Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com> for
          providing the patch.

Mon Oct 21 06:38:41 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsLogAdmin.dsp: Fixed link errors in Win32
          builds.

Mon Oct 21 11:03:06 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

        * docs/compiler.html: Updated tao_idl compiler option documentation
          for the "-t", temporary directory, options.

Sun Oct 20 08:18:28 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Makefile: Fixed a typo that broke the minimum builds.

Sun Oct 20 00:23:03 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/server.cpp:
          Renamed the variables loc1 and loc2 as location1 and
          location2. The variables loc1 and loc2 is a legacy left over in
          UNIX, which denotes pointers to characters matched by regular
          expressions. This should fix compile errors in SunCC builds.

Sun Oct 20 00:10:14 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Makefile: Fixed the problems with this
          change "Fri Oct 18 15:52:11 2002 Priyanka Gontla
          <pgontla@ociweb.com>".

Sat Oct 19 09:47:43 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Prevent ImplRepo from being compiled
          in minimum_corba setting. The fix "Fri Oct 18 15:52:11 2002
          Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>" seems goofy. Need to get
          Craig and Priyanka to take a look.

          units as TAO_Rtec_LogConsumer, TAO_Notify_LogConsumer and
          TAO_Event_LogConsumer. This should fix link time warnings in
          SUNCC builds.

Fri Oct 18 23:32:11 2002  Mayur Deshpande  <mayur@ics.uci.edu>

        * examples/AMH/Sink_Server/Timer_Handler.cpp (handle_timeout):

          Changed the ResponseHandler to a _var instead of a _ptr. This
          not only takes care of deleting the pointer in exceptional
          circumstances but the code is also much cleaner.  Thanks to
          Ossama Othman <ossama.ece.uci.edu> for the tip and code-review.

Fri Oct 18 22:23:53 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:

          Fixed a problem with the SunCC preprocessor. When processing a
          non-quoted scoped name, as may occur in #pragma version, typeid,
          or typeprefix, this preprocessor regards the double colons as
          separate tokens and bookends them with spaces. Had to add code to
          check for this and strip out the spaces.

Fri Oct 18 16:49:04 2002  Jaiganesh Balasubramanian  <jai@doc.ece.uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/run_test.pl:
          Added the file to the new directory created for the test.

Fri Oct 18 16:11:23 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_i.cpp (Log_i): Patch to prevent compile
          errors on OpenBSD. Thanks to Frank Hunleth <frank@hunleth.com>
          for the patch. The problem is because of a type conversion from
          unsigned long to time_t. Looks like time_t is an int on
          OpenBSD.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_i.h: Some cosmetic fixes.

Fri Oct 18 16:09:37 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/README.txt:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/README:
          Removed README and added README.txt instead as doxygen
          is looking for only txt files besides the normal implementation,
          header and inline files.

          Thanks to Bala for pointing the reason why the index.html is not
          getting generated via doxygen.

Fri Oct 18 15:52:11 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/NameService/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Applied the patches provided by Craig Rodrigues so that
          Implementation Repostory and related tests will be compiled
          only when ImplRepo is added to the list of TAO_ORBSVCS
          in platform_macros.

          Thanks to Craig Rodrigues for pointing this out and for
          the patches.

Fri Oct 18 15:59:58 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/AMH/Sink_Server/mt_server.cpp:
        * examples/AMH/Sink_Server/st_server.cpp: Removed strange inl file
          inclusions in the above files.

Fri Oct 18 15:56:04 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/AMH/Sink_Server/Base_Server.h: Included the inline
          file in the header file.

Fri Oct 18 15:46:29 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.CosLoadBalancing: Removed the check for
          'ami' and 'interceptors' from this file. Most of the Makefiles
          in the orbsvcs adds the check in the top level Makefile, with a
          reason.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Moved the check here. The main reason
          for having the check here is that, once the list of Makefiles
          that needs to be run is built, it writes out the
          ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS.list file,  even if the actual Makefile for the
          said service is not executed. This creates problems for the
          tests and examples that depends on the contents within the
          ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS.list file.

Fri Oct 18 15:40:11 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImR_Activator.bor:
          Corrected the NAME of the executable.
          Thanks to Christian Barheine <cbarheine@sympatec.com>
          for finding the problem and also for the patch.

Fri Oct 18 10:30:20 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

          Addressed number of @@ comments left by Ossama on previous
          code-review. Fleshed out classes into .h and .cpp and .inl
          files, added more error-handling, compliance to ACE/TAO
          coding-rules, passing by references instead of pointers/value,
          and tons of other fixes.  Thanks Ossama!

        * tao/PortableServer/AMH_Response_Handler.cpp:

          Changed all the 'transport->send_message ()' from the default
          parameter for 'message_semantics' (TAO_Transport::Two_Way) to
          TAO_Transport::TAO_Reply.  Doing this blocks the sender until
          the reply is sent. This change suggested by Balachandran
          Natarajan <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu> fixes a bug
          reported by Martin Johnson <mjhn@bigpond.net.au> where an AMH
          server crashed when it was sending back huge payload (>16K) to a
          multithreaded (>50) client.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.cpp
          (populate_object_group, process_criteria):

          Explicitly cast an unsigned short value to unsigned long.
          Borland C++ apparently gets confused and assumes that the
          unsigned short value is signed.  Silences a warning.

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Application_Controlled/Makefile:

          Check whether the CosLoadBalancing library was built. This
          check was there already but at the wrong place.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_cs.cpp:

          Fixed a problem with MSVC not being able to invoke fully
          qualified member methods (except in the initializer), which
          appeared when the _tao_obv_narrow() method calls the
          corresponding method of a base class. If the base class has
          the same local name, the ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro breaks and
          the call goes into an endless loop. For MSVC, identical
          methods using the flat name are generated for each class,
          and called by derived classes. Thanks to Don Hinton
          <dhinton@ieee.org> for reporting the bug and Jon Franklin
          <jfranklin@dctd.saic.com> for providing a patch.

Wed Oct 16 12:37:07 2002  Jaiganesh Balasubramanian  <jai@doc.ece.uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/Makefile:
          Added the new Makefile to compile "directories" under this
          directory.

Wed Oct 16 12:23:29 2002  Jaiganesh Balasubramanian  <jai@doc.ece.uci.edu

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory:
          Added a new directory "Application_Controlled".
          This directory contains all the files required for testing
          the object group creation and deletion with
          application-controlled membership.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_decl.h:
        * TAO_IDL/include/utl_scope.h:

          Fixed a bug in typeprefix propagation by moving a class member
          and accessors from UTL_Scope to AST_Decl, and changing code
          where the accessors are called.

Tue Oct 15 20:05:48 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/LoadBalancing/GenericFactory/run_test.pl:

          Use TerminateWaitKill() instead of WaitKill() when terminating
          the LoadManager binary.  The LoadManager handles the SIGTERM and
          SIGINT signals to allow for graceful shutdown in order to clean
          up remote resources.  TerminateWaitKill() sends a SIGTERM signal
          (as opposed to SIGKILL) to the process in question, thus
          giving the LoadManager the chance to shutdown gracefully.  This
          addresses a bogus exit status from the LoadManager binary.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Group_Guard.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Group_Guard.cpp:

          New guard implementation designed to improve exception safety
          when creating object groups.  It is used internally by the
          TAO_PG_GenericFactory class.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.h
          (delete_object_i):

          Made this method public so that the new TAO_PG_Group_Guard class
          may invoke it.

          (populate_object_group):

          Made factory creation ID argument "const" to prevent subtle bugs
          from being potentially introduced in the future.

          This method now accepts a reference to the factory set
          associated with a given factory creation ID.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.cpp
          (create_object):

          The factory set is now instantiated in this method and passed to
          the populate_object_group() method.  This change was necessary
          to improve exception safety when cleaning up resources created
          during a failed attempt at creating an object group.

          Use a TAO_PG_Group_Guard to improve exception safety in the
          presence of a failed object group creation attempt.

          (delete_object):

          Upon successful destruction of remote object group members
          through their corresponding factories, unbind the factory set
          that contained those factories from the internal factory map.
          Closes a resource leak.

          (process_criteria):

          If the desired minimum number of members is less than the number
          of supplied GenericFactorys, add a new element containing the
          name and value of the MinimumNumberMembers property to the unmet
          criteria sequence that is the attribute of the
          PortableGroup::CannotMeetCriteria exception to be thrown.

Tue Oct 15 17:34:07 2002  Jaiganesh Balasubramanian  <jai@doc.ece.uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.cpp:
          Made a change in the delete_object () function.
          There is a check to see if the factory set is bound
          to the factory map or not. If we do not find an entry
          in the map, a exception was thrown.
          In the case of application-controlled membership, we do
          not have a factory set bound to the factory map at all.
          So the else case can be removed.
          Thanks to Ossama Othman <ossama@uci.edu> for helping
          me track down this problem.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Default_Property_Validator.cpp
          (validate_criteria):

          Reduce the length of the invalid criteria sequence in an effort
          to optimize the copying that will occur when the
          PortableGroup::InvalidCriteria exception is thrown.  Reducing
          the length is fast since no deallocations should occur.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.h
          (populate_object_group):

          Accept an "initial number of members" value.  It will be used
          when creating the initial object group members via the
          infrastructure.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_GenericFactory.cpp
          (create_object, process_criteria):

          Moved criteria validation code to the process_criteria() method.

          Verify that the InitialNumberMembers property is larger than the
          MinimumNumberMembers property.  It doesn't make sense to create
          members numbering less than the minimum.  Throw a
          PortableGroup::CannotMeetCriteria exception in that case.

          Populate the "unmet_criteria" attribute of the
          PortableGroup::CannotMeetCriteria exception before throwing that
          exception.  Previously, a default constructed exception was
          thrown.

          (populate_object_group):

          In the infrastructure controlled membership case, initially
          create the number of members specified in the
          InitialNumberMember property.  Previously, the number of initial
          members was the same as the number of FactoryInfos, which is
          undesirable since members were always automatically created.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_conf.h
          (TAO_PG_MINIMUM_NUMBER_MEMBERS):

          The default minimum number of members value should always be
          equal to (or greater) the default initial number of members
          value (TAO_PG_INITIAL_NUMBER_MEMBERS).  This is a precautionary
          measure to meant avoid errors introduced by only changing one of
          the default values.

          const cast operator from ValueBase_var, since it was causing a
          problem with the HP-UX 11.11 compiler, and valuetypes do not
