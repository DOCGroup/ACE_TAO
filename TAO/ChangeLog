        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Component_Switching/run_test.pl:

          Added missing "-" for ORBSvcConf option.

        * tests/Oneway_Timeouts/client.cpp:
        * tests/Oneway_Timeouts/server.cpp:

          Added make_request_queued option to work around test failure due to 
          different connection establishment behavior between OS.  Some system 
          can connect immediately and some may take longer time. With the option, 
          the test sets the SYNC_NONE scope and sends a request so the transport
          queue is not empty for some SYNC_DELAYED_BUFFERING test cases and hence 
          the requests are all queued and will be received by server continueously 
          during a short period. (Bugzilla #3384) 

        * tests/Oneway_Timeouts/run_test.pl:

          Added -make_request_queued option for the two failed test cases.
           - test_buffering -- case 4 of 6
           - test_buffer_timeout -- case 2 of 3

          A transport in connecting state can potentially be referenced by
          multiple concurrent oneway invocations. Transport access needs
          to be synchronized during invocation.

Fri Aug 29 19:12:49 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp (wait_for_connection_completion):

          If the connection is already complete, add it to the cache here.

Fri Aug 29 03:39:39 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Bug_1269_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Increased client timeout to 60 seconds from 45 seconds to fix
          timeout error. The client receives 100th request and sleep for
          15 seconds before abort. If server block for 15 seconds for
          each client, then 45 seconds would not be enough.

        * tao/Connection_Handler.h:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.inl:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp:

          Added a bool is_closed_ to track the "closed" state.  This is used
          in addition to the Leader-Follower state so that it cannot be re-set
          to another state after it's been closed.

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp:

          Fixed whitespace.

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Increased client timeout (we're just testing the server's response).
          Reduced the server debug level when "-debug" is specificed.

Thu Aug 28 20:27:37 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Faults/run_test.pl:

          Increased timeout to avoid the pong timeout error on windows.
          When server dies, the client tries to make new connection. The
          time spent on trying new connection varies on different platform.
          On windows, it takes much longer than on Linux.

Wed Aug 27 21:24:33 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Faults/client.cpp:

          Added sleep after twoway invocation for suicide test cases. The
          client will wait for the shutdown callback and abort until timeout.
          If it timed out, the test will fail, otherwise, the test succeed.
          This should fix test failure due to twoway request returned before
          receiving shutdown callback and abort.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (purge_entry):

          Use the handler_lock_ when changing state (cache_map_entry_).

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp (wait_for_connection_completion):

          Combine the blocked and non-blocked cases for the part where it
          checks if the transport has already been connected, closed, or
          timed-out.  Previously the blocked connect didn't check these.

        * tao/LF_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_Event.inl:

          Allow for multiple followers per event (if derived classes implement
          this behavior).  Specifically, added a "follower" argument to
          unbind() to match bind().

        * tao/LF_Multi_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_Multi_Event.cpp:

          Modified for the new unbind() signature.

        * tao/LF_CH_Event.h:
        * tao/LF_CH_Event.cpp:

          Implement multiple followers using an ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex.  This

        * tao/LF_Event_Binder.h:
        * tao/LF_Event_Binder.inl:
        * tao/LF_Event_Binder.cpp:

          Store the follower pointer so that it can be passed to unbind().

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp (wait_for_connection_completion):

          Purge the entry from the cache if the connection fails.

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Add server logging output if -debug is passed.

Wed Aug 13 16:21:34 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp (wait_for_transport):

          Combined the if/else branches for is_timeout and is_closed since both
          cases need to remove the Transport from the cache.

Tue Aug 12 21:54:43 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp (wait_for_transport):

          If the connection is timed-out or closed, return false immediately.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (post_open):

          Write to is_connected_ within the handler_lock_, updated comment.

        * tao/Transport.inl (is_connected):

          Updated comment to reflect change to is_connected_ in post_open().

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.inl:
        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp:

          set_entry_state() now updates the cache entry's is_connected_ flag to
          match the real state of the transport.  This change required
          un-inlining the method.
          Removed multiple instances of the code "if (entry == 0) ..."
          that occured before locking.  These could be added back if they are
          proved safe.  As of now I'm not convinced, so that check is done with
          the lock held.  These were in set_entry_state(), purge_entry(),
          mark_invalid(), mark_connected(), and mark_idle().

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Added lots of logging when -debug is passed on the command line.

Mon Aug 11 17:56:15 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Some changes related to AMI timeouts. The tms stores the relationship
          between the request id and the reply dispatcher. For AMI timeouts the
          Asynch_Timeout_Handler did the same, so reworked that. The ATH now just
          calls a method on the TMS, then also we can callback to the rd with the
          tms lock hold just as we do for regular replies.

        * tao/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher_Base.cpp:

        * MPC/config/bidir_giop.mpb:

          Added avoids_corba_e_micro as base.  BiDir GIOP requires a child POA,
          which makes it incompatible with CORBA/e Micro.

        * tests/Bug_3068_Regression/Bug_3068_Regression.mpc:

          Added "threads" as a base -- this test requires threads.

          with SYNC_NONE, etc.

Thu Aug  7 17:46:45 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        This commit fixes Bug 2935 (again) and resolves other transport cache
        management issues.  The key issue of 2935 is that the transport is
        cached while the connection is in progress, so that other threads see
        that there's a connection in progress and don't start their own.
        That feature is essentially restoring one of the changes from
        Tue May 20 18:05:08 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>
        that were reverted in
        Fri May 30 13:21:20 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport_Connector.h:
        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp:

          Cache the transport before waiting for the connection to complete.
          This requires the re-addition of a Transport_Descriptor_Interface
          parameter to wait_for_connection_completion().

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connector.cpp:

          Pass the transport descriptor to wait_for_connection_completion().

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:

          Pass the transport descriptor to wait_for_connection_completion().
          In the case where the transport is already connected in
          complete_connection() add it to the cache here.  In the case of
          parallel connects in complete_connection(), modified the logic for
          when the cache is updated.

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.h:
        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.inl:
        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp:

          Removed the unused, private, bind() method.  Added logging at level
          10.  Update the is_connected_ flag in the case where we're updating
          an existing cache entry.  In cache_transport(), construct the IntId
          with the lock held to ensure consistent state.  Also, if the
          transport is already connected make sure not to set the state to
          ENTRY_CONNECTING.

        * tao/Connector_Impl.cpp:

          Moved the line that sets the transport to CLIENT_ROLE here.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:

          Logging improvements.

        * tao/Cache_Entries.h:
        * tao/Cache_Entries.inl:
        * tao/Cache_Entries.cpp:

          Added logging using state names instead of numbers.

        * tests/Bug_2243_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Removed faulty assumption that required $TAO_ROOT == $ACE_ROOT/TAO.

        * tests/Bug_3108_Regression/client.cpp:

          Added a -c parameter to client to change the number of threads.

        * tests/Bug_3108_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Added separate log files {client,server}.log when -debug is used.

Thu Aug  7 09:43:11 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Muxed_TMS.{h,cpp}:
          Made all members private. Changed clear_cache to
          clear_cache_i to make clear this method expects the
          lock to be hold. Simplified logic in the bind_dispatcher

Wed Aug  6 23:12:35 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Big_Oneways/Peer.cpp:

          Updated create_session() to explicitly activate servant for CORBA e
          build since CORBA e does not allow implicit servant activation. This
          prevents WrongPolicy exception raised and hence avoids the MARSHAL
          exception when trying to send WrongPolicy reply exception.

Wed Aug  6 22:38:46 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

          Add to the criteria for invalidating the addr type of a

          because the INET_Addr::set() function in that case explicitly
          sets the address family to INET regardless of the address. The
          endpoint policy later relies on an invalid addr type for
          deciding how strictly to test candidate endpoint addresses. In
          particular, defaulted hostnames are allowed in the endpoint
          policy only when more than one protocol is present.

          Short recap, the test was failing silently.  The failure was a
          false positive because the test had been changed to reproduce
          one bug (2877), but in the process broke the original test.
          Fortunately or unfortunately, you had to read the output to
          detect the problem.

          New ZIOP test using zlib

Tue Jul 22 11:31:28 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Major commit to add ZIOP to the core of TAO. This adds the capability
        to compress the data on the wire. This is a proof of concept implementation
        that we try to get standardized within the CORBA spec. Interoperability
        with other ORBs and different TAO versions isn't guaranteed until ZIOP
        has been formally adopted by the OMG. If you want to experiment with ZIOP
        add TAO_HAS_ZIOP 1 as define to your config.h file. This prototype will need
        some more work to support ZIOP for the full request/reply chain, in some
        cases the reply isn't compressed at this moment. For this we need to rework
        the full policy support in the ORB for which we search funding.

        * MPC/config/ziop.mpb:

        * orbsvcs/tests/unit/Notify/MC/NotificationServiceMonitor/NotificationServiceMonitor.cpp:

          Added a fetch of the number of entries in the registry at the
          start of the test, subsequent compares check that all monitors
          added by the test itself are found and recognized. The number of
          monitors extant at the start of the test on different platforms
          varies, so this is the only way to decouple the test code from
          the platform.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.am:

          Removed Statistic.{h,inl,cpp} and added
          Timestamp_Monitor.{h,cpp} to the CosNotification_MC build.

        * orbsvcs/tests/unit/Notify/MC/NotificationServiceMonitor/NotificationServiceMonitor.cpp:

          Disabled some test result checks for HPUX platforms,
          they seem to have a different number of monitors in
          the registry, since several are now created automatically
          for ACE message queues, CDR buffers, POA active object
          maps, etc., but it isn't a bug.

        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.cpp:

          Allow TAO to work on win32 hosts with only IPv4 when TAO is built
          with ACE_HAS_IPV6 and ACE_USES_IPV4_IPV6_MIGRATION both set. The
          migration flag is intended to make ACE/TAO test if IPv6 is enabled
          at runtime, and to work without it. However, when TAO was required
          to default its endpoint, it insisted on making an IPv6 endpoint
          regardless of the enablement. This fix resolves bug 3353.

          Added missing PerlACE::add_lib_path ('../lib'); to run-time
          test so that test dynamic libraries can be found. Stops
          windows dialog concerning missing dll.

          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macros for argc and argv, to avoid unused
          arg warnings when monitors are disabled.

        * tests/Bug_2809_Regression/server.cpp:

          I miss-removed a const and a const_cast<>() yesterday. It
          would have been better to have the const_cast<>() in place
          around the initial strings, rather than the call point to
          highlight the reason for the cast in the first place. i.e:
          warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to ACE_TCHAR*
          Since our ORB_init() call doesn't actually modify the strings
          we can get away with the casting instead of buffer allocation
          and copying.

Thu Jun 26 02:37:59 UTC 2008  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Messaging/AMH_Response_Handler.cpp:

          Set the outbound GIOP version number to the correct value when
          sending a response from an AMH servant. The problem is that there
          are too many output CDR instances and AMH response handler uses
          a different one from the generated skeletons. This resolves the
          issue raised by Steve Vinoski and Ittehad Shaikh.

          Add support for limiting the use of defaulted hostnames in IIOP
          endpoints to only be allowed when using multiple protocols on
          the ORB. The motivation for this limit is described in bugzilla
          3256.

          Extend the test to accomodate the new capability of the
          EndpointPolicy with IIOP endpoints. The lh variant of the
          test uses localhost endpoints which are not ordinarily tested.
          This case is not described specifically in bug 3256.

Tue Jun 10 14:53:00 UTC 2008  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Factory.cpp:
          Tie Security and SSLIOP library lifetimes to that of their
          registered ORBInitializers. This prevents the library getting
          unloaded before the ORBInitializer destructions.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          CSD threads borrow the ORB's thread-manager to spawn CSD
          threads. Doing this forces the ORB to wait for CSD cleanup at
          destruction time. This prevents a race between CSD cleanup and
          ORB destruction.

        * tao/PI/DLL_Resident_ORB_Initializer.h:
        * tao/PI/DLL_Resident_ORB_Initializer.cpp:
          Define and use DLL_Resident_ORB_Initializer to act as
          a decorator/intermediary for an ORB_Initializer that is
          defined in a DLL.  Without this there are timing issues
          when the DLL is unloaded before the ORB_Initializer is
          released.

        * tao/PI/ORBInitializer_Registry_Impl.cpp:
          Release ORB Initializers in the reverse order
          of their creation.
          Add diagnostic messages.

Tue Jun 10 13:21:29 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:

        * tests/Bug_3315_Regression/main.cpp:
        * tests/Bug_3321_Regression/main.cpp:

          For SunCC only, added an extern "C" to the declaration of

Tue Jun 10 11:38:15 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/OctetSeq/run_test.pl:

          Testing a change to utilize my new process modules that will
          simplify the test script modifications necessary for VxWorks
          testing.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/MonitorControl/Control_Registry.cpp:

        * utils/NamingViewer/NamingViewer.cpp:

          Correct Wide character build miss-converstions.

        * tao/CORBA_methods.h:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Provide wide "helper" ORB_Init() only in wide char builds.
          (Too many tests try and send wide versions of argv
          into ORB_init() and whilst that function was written
          with converters in mind, it was only defined in terms
          of the narrow OMG standard interface, having extra helper
          "auto-converting" interfaces helps.)

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Profile.cpp:

          Changed the function for parsing of group id from strtoul
          to strtoull as it's required by CORBA specification.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/NotifyLogFactory_i.cpp:

          Changed create_repositoryid() method to obtain the repository id
          by using the appropriate typecode's id() method instead of using
          a hardcoded string.  This avoids problems like the one reported
          in issue #3320, where the repository id for BasicLog had a typo.
          Thanks to Bogdan Jeram < bjeram at eso dot org > for reporting
          this.

          Reverted a portion of my change from Fri May 30 13:21:20 UTC 2008.

Thu Jun 05 15:22:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at prismtech dot com>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:

          Correct the wide character output messages and strings.

        * examples/MFC/server.mpc:
        * utils/NamingViewer/NamingViewer.mpc:

          Originally was going to provide specific *Unicode.mpc
          but the non-unicode ones se can actually dual up (so
          reverse the previous original change).

Thu Jun  5 11:56:09 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:

          Added a new template method to enable copying of the underlying
          message block chain on demand.

        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.cpp:

          This is never necessary for asynch messages and is implemented as
          such.

        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp:

          Copy the underlying message block chain when it is part of the
          target chain (passed in).

        * tao/Transport.cpp:

          Call the new copy_if_necessary() method on the queued message if
          we have sent out only a portion of the message.  Without this
          change, the Bug_2494_Regression was core dumping every time.

        * tests/Bug_2494_Regression/client.cpp:

          Fixed memory leaks.

        * tests/Bug_2494_Regression/server.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in the default ior output file name.

        * tests/Bug_2654_Regression/client.cpp:

          Documented a couple of the magic numbers.

Tue Jun  3 15:19:18 UTC 2008  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * docs/LocalObject.html:
          TAO has been updated conform to the 1.2 IDL to C++ mapping.
          LocalObject is now refcounted by default. Updated the
          documentation to reflect the changes.

        * tao/Transport_Connector.h:
        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp:

          Changed the wait_for_transport() method to always use a timeout
          when waiting through the active connect strategy.  Not doing so
          can cause a deadlock if another thread is already in the reactor
          (through CORBA::ORB::run()).

Mon Jun  2 21:51:36 UTC 2008  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:

          Reordered the parsing of parameters and the registration of global
          services within TAO::ORB::open_global_services(), as the global
          services registration needs to have the result of parsing out
          -ORBNegotiateCodesets before it tries to load the codeset library.

          the patch.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp.diff:

          Added this and change from previous commit to be automatically
          applied when lex.yy.cpp is generated; Not sure why these are suddenly
          necessary, may be an anomaly in my version of flex.

Mon Jun  2 14:02:02 UTC 2008  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl_mcpp.mpb:
        * TAO_IDL/fe_mcpp.mpb:

        Changes to enable in-memory preprocessing AND lexing of IDL files
        with the MCPP preprocessor.  This eliminates the need to use multiple
        temporary files for this process.  This capability is triggered by enabling
        the mcpp feature when generating project files, which causes the in-memory
        preprocessing and lexing to replace the external preprocessor/temporary file
        preprocessing and lexing which is still used by default.

        * TAO_IDL/preproc.mpb:

        Renamed to tao_idl_mcpp.mbp.

          Fixed a bug which resulted in includes not being properly generated.

Fri May 30 23:32:47 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/LogNotification.cpp:

          Convert current time to TimeBase::TimeT with new
          ORBSVCS_Time::to_Absolute_TimeT() method.  This fixes a
          bug where we were returning the time as a relative time,
          and simplifies the code by removing temporaries.

Fri May 30 15:04:17 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.cpp:

          Add new methods ORBSVCS_Time::to_Absolute_TimeT() and
          ORBSVCS_Time::to_TimeT() which take an ACE_Time_Value parameter
          and return a TimeBase::TimeT. These are wrappers around the
          existing ORBSVCS_Time::Absolute_Time_Value_to_TimeT() and
          ORBSVCS_Time::Time_Value_to_TimeT() methods, but allow use in
          contexts that would otherwise require the introduction of a
          temporary.

Fri May 30 13:21:20 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport_Connector.h:
        * tao/Transport_Connector.cpp:

          Modified the connect() method to wait for the connection
          completion if a transport is found but not connected.  Also, fixed
          a memory leak if a connection was found in the cache but had
          previously experienced an error.

          This version of connect() is a hybrid of Dale's version and the
          previous version.

          Also, the wait_for_connection_completion() method was changed to
          not require the descriptor interface.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/IIOP_SSL_Connector.cpp:

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Connector.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connector.cpp:

          It is no longer necessary to pass in the descriptor interface to
          wait_for_connection_completion().

        * orbsvcs/tests/unit/Notify/MC/Statistic/Statistic.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/MonitorControl/Statistic.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/MonitorControl/Statistic.cpp:

          Added implementation for the overload of receive() taking
          a size_t argument. Even though there is an implementation
          in the base class, we were getting warnings from some of
          the Red Hat Linux builds.

          Made the method virtual, also made virtual in the ACE

          called on a TAO_Statistic monitor fetched from the registry

          Added tao_monitor base project.

          Added include of $TAO_ROOT/tao/Monitor.idl and used the
          indirectly included StringSeq type for NameList, instead of
          declaring a new typedef. These changes are the start of

          Added tao_monitor as a base project.

        * tao/Monitor.mpc:

          Changes to IDL compiler command line options to generate
          typecodes needed by dependent types in NotificationServiceMC.idl.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root/root.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_structure/structure_cs.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in the use case where typecodes must be
          generated into *A.h and *A.cpp files, and the headers
          propagated via a 'safe include' through another IDL
          file with no declarations of its own.

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/ServantRetentionStrategyRetain.cpp:

          Added the ORB's string name to the name of the connection
          cache size monitor, connection cache purge monitor, and
          the Active Object Map size monitor, since some tests were
          creating multiple ORBs, causing name clashes in the monitor
          registry.

          Reinstated Dale Wilson's changes from Wed Aug  1 15:54:01 UTC 2007.

          Briefly: the change involves adding the transport to the
          cache at the time the connection is initiated rather than
          waiting until the connection is complete.   This avoids the
          situation where *way* too many connections are started in a
          nested upcall and/or multithreading situation because none
          of the connection attempts know the others are already in
          progress.
          At the same time it eliminates the wait-for-condition code
          technique for honoring the -MaxMuxedConnections. The old
          technique is unsafe and ineffective.

          These changes were reverted on Fri Aug 17 15:50:19 UTC 2007.

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:

          Pass the flags provided to the close() method on to the call of
          close_handler().

        * tao/Connection_Handler.h:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp:

          Changed close_handler() to accept flags (from the service handler
          close() call).  These flags help determine when the reference
          count of the transport should be removed.

          The above changes are part of Bug 2935.

            TAO_ETCL_Literal_Constraint.

          - Removed all constraint classes from TAO_ETCL except
            TAO_ETCL_Literal_Constraint. This class is the only
            one that uses CORBA::Any and is thus CORBA-specific,
            all the other classes can be represented by their
            base classes in ACE_ROOT/ace/ETCL.

          New files that simply include their counterparts in
          $ACE_ROOT/ace/ETCL. The lex and yacc files are generated
          and can't be factored into CORBA and non-CORBA pieces as
          the other ETCL files have been. On the other hand, there
          doesn't seem to be any way found so far to get makefiles
          to recompile a set of source files into a different set
          of object files in a different location, so that things
          like realclean will depend on the new object files. This
          workaround in similar to what has been done for the IDL
          compiler driver, which is composed of the same source
          but links to different backends.

          New regression for bugzilla 3315. When TAO is used from a thread
          created without ACE it leads to an assert in ACE. When we have
          pthread we use the pthread api, else we just use ACE. Without
          the change from Iliyan in ace/Service_Config.cpp this test fails
          but with his change this test runs. Thanks to Abdul Sowayan for
          creating this regression test.

          Docu change

Thu May  1 18:09:05 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_ACE.mwc:

          Removed $ACE_ROOT/MonitorControl/MonitorControl.mpc, this MPC
          file has been relocated and is now covered under $ACE_ROOT/ace.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/client.cpp:

          Changed header include paths to reflect the relocation of
          the MonitorControl library.

Wed Apr 30 17:16:54 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/client.cpp:
        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/server.cpp:

          Added include to pull in ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION and
          ACE_ANY_EXCEPTION macros, which were not recognized
          in some Debian builds.

Wed Apr 30 17:01:24 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/client.cpp:
        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/marshal_buffer.mpc:

          Removed ENABLE_MONITORS macro which is no longer used.

Wed Apr 30 12:13:59 UTC 2008  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_union.cpp:

          Added missing break.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h:

          Ugly macros to get this to compile portably.

Wed Apr 30 11:57:18 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Constraint_Visitors.cpp:

          Restored the original order of included header files to
          eliminate template-related compile errors with gcc.

Wed Apr 30 11:55:04 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/PICurrent/run_test.pl:
        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/PICurrent/server.cpp:

          Modified this test to use -SvcConfDirective instead of creating an
          svc.conf.  For single-threaded builds, the thread-per-connection
          setting does not work.  So, when threads are enabled add the
          -SvcConfDirective to enable thread-per-connection.  When threads
          are disabled, issue a notice and continue on in single-threaded
          mode.

Wed Apr 30 11:51:40 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/config/tao_vc8warnings.mpb:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ETCL/*:

          Removed this directory and its contents, it is replaced
          by $TAO_ROOT/tao/ETCL. Some code has been factored to
          $ACE_ROOT/ace/ETCL and some identifiers have changed,
          but no intentional changes have been made to the behavior.

          Don't use TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object but ::CORBA::LocalObject now
          LocalObject is also refcounted. Users can still use TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object,
          it just does nothing, actions have been takin in LocalObject.h
          to prevent the usage of TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object in the

        * NEWS:

          Added a new ORB parameter, -ORBAcceptErrorDelay, that controls the
          amount of time to wait before attempting to accept new connections
          when a possibly transient error occurs during accepting a new
          connection. A delay of zero indicates that accepting should not be
          attempted again after the transient error and the handler will be
          removed from the reactor.

        * tao/Transport_Acceptor.h:
        * tao/Transport_Acceptor.inl:
        * tao/Transport_Acceptor.cpp:

          Added code to inspect the error behind an accept() failure and
          take action according to the above ORB parameter.  This includes a
          template that derives from ACE_Strategy_Acceptor that allows the
          sub-classed accptors to use this error handling with minimal code
          changes.

          method.  It expects an RTCORBA priority, not a native priority.

Tue Apr  8 12:04:20 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          This is the last batch of changes related to the re-factoring of
          the service configuration, which aims to eliminate a number of
          related memory leaks and bugs. The changes are being ported back
          from the "iliyan-gestalt" branch.

        * tao/ORB.h:
        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init,init_orb_globals,find_orb_context):

          Modified ORB_init to accept -ORBGestalt command line parameter
          which specifies which service configuration context the new ORB
          will use.  Acceptable values (case-insensitive) include "LOCAL"
          forces the ORB to manage its own, local service configuration
          context (gestalt).  "GLOBAL" forces the new ORB to use (but not
          own) the process-global gestalt. The caller can also identify a
          particular existing ORB, who will share its ownership of a gestalt
          with the new ORB. The existing ORB ID must be prefixed with "ORB:"
          and the resulting string as a whole is case-sensitive. Removed
          init_orb_globals.

        * tao/ORB_Core.h (TAO_ORB_Core):
        * tao/ORB_Core.inl (configuration):
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (TAO_ORB_Core,orbinitializer_registry_i):

          Modified tor to take a smart pointer for the service
          configuration. The core now has a smart pointer member which
          allows us to destroy local service configuration contexts
          _exactly_ when they are no longer needed and eliminate memory
          leaks.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.h:
        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (close_services,open_services):

          Updated for the use of smart pointer for the gestalt

        * tests/ORB_Local_Config/Shared/Test.cpp (testReusingGlobals):

        Changes to account for the intrusive-recounted-ness of
        ACE_Service_Gestalt instances.

Fri Apr  4 22:15:16 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        This is the first batch of changes related to the refactoring of
        the service configuration, which aims to eliminate a number of
        related memory leaks and bugs. The changes are being ported back
        from the "iliyan-gestalt" branch.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Bug_3216_Regression/run_test.pl:

        Fixed to use $ACE_ROOT instead of '../..', to search for PerlACE.

        * tao/ORBInitializer_Registry.cpp:

        Removing a misplaced call to TAO::ORB::init_orb_globals(). Now
        that the latter has non-trivial functionality, calling it from an
        ORB initializer would be wrong.

        * tests/Bug_2735_Regression/server.cpp:

        The argv must be 0-terminated to fulfill the contract with C's
        argv.

        * tests/Bug_2936_Regression/PersistentPOA.cpp:

        Fixing (what seems to be) a bad ownership transfer of Object's,
        causing memory leaks.

        * tests/Bug_3251_Regression/Bug_3251.conf:
        * tests/Bug_3251_Regression/PersistentPoa.h:
        * tests/Bug_3251_Regression/server.cpp:

        Changes to make it compile (but not test anything) on
        Windows. Also added a call to sync (after fork) so we get the
        correct values for PID in the child.

        * tests/ORB_Local_Config/run_tests_all.pl:

        Fixed a bug that was preventing it from running.

Fri Apr  4 10:20:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <simon dot massey at prismtech dot com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Bug_1630_Regression/testclient.cpp:

Thu Apr  3 15:15:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <simon dot massey at prismtech dot com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_TypedEventChannel.cpp:

          Another "interface" VC8 MFC conflict.

Thu Apr  3 09:40:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <simon dot massey at prismtech dot com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_TypedEventChannel.h:

          Using "interface" as the descriptive name of a parameter seems to
          cause VC8 (when building with MFC) to assume you mean a struct type
          and it raises an incorrect systax error.

Thu Apr  3 01:18:45 UTC 2008  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DSI_Gateway/client.cpp:

          Reworded exception handlers to avoid having the nightly build
          scoreboard detect expected exceptions as errors. This is the
          same error that was documented in bug 2879.

Wed Apr  2 12:13:50 UTC 2008  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DSI_AMI_Gateway/client.cpp:

          Reworded exception handlers to avoid having the nightly build

          bug 2879.

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp:

          Provided additional fix for Bug#2376. In particular added is_forwaded
          argument to Collocation_Proxy_Broker::dispatch which will indicate a
          forwarding case. Changed code generation in tao_idl according to the
          new signature of that dispatch method. Also found another place in
          Upcall_Wrapper.cpp that assumes that forwarding must be done if a
          forward reference is not nil. And since TAO_ServerRequest has both
          pi_reply_status and reply_status features added a code that set to
          forwarding state each of them if only one changes. So, that if
          reply_status is set GIOP::LOCATION_FORWARD then pi_reply_status
          is set to PortableInterceptor::LOCATION_FORWARD immediately after
          that.

          Added a statistic to track the queue size for each ConsumerAdmin.
          Each time a message is added to or removed from the queue, a queue
          measurement is taken.  This allows the statistic observer to see
          the average queue size for each consumer admin.

          Conversly, the event channel queue size is calculated by adding up
          all the consumer admin queues and is only accessed when the
          statistic observer requests it.

          Added the ability to remove individual consumers and suppliers
          from the event channel.  Technically, the supplier proxy and
          consumer proxy are the objects that are removed.

          Added operations to remove consumer and supplier admins through
          the monitor interface.

          admins by name.

        * tao/tao.mpc:
          Made the handling of service contexts pluggable. Previously
          the core of TAO did know how to handle the IOP::BI_DIR_IIOP
          service context. Introduced a new Service Context Handler
          base class from which concrete handlers are derived, these
          handlers are then registered with the service context handler
          registry for a certain context id. This way the BiDIR
          library handles the BiDIR service context. The future
          compression support can now also be implemented without
          that the core knows much about this. The next step is to
          refactor the adding of the bidir service context to a message
          in such a way that it is pluggable.

          Moved the contents of taoidldefaults to taobaseidldefaults,
          taoidldefaults now also derives from the CORBA profiles
          so that when we compile IDL we also generate code focused
          for the set profile. This reduces the size of the generated
          code, this fixes bugzilla 3233
