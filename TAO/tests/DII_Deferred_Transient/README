/**

@page DII Discarded Deferred Request Test README File

  The goals of writing this test are:

- Test transient error management (in case of disappearing/unreachable clients)
  with the deferred DII calling scheme.

  To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  the script returns 0 if the test was successful.

  In case of a regression the test might segfault.
