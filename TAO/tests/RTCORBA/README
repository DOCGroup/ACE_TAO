This directory houses a collection of tests which exercise TAO support
for features defined in the RTCORBA specification.  OMG Real-time
CORBA specification is available at:
http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/99-05-03 (or check the OMG website
for a more recent version).  Documentation for TAO's implementation of
RTCORBA 1.0 specification is available at:

Each individual subdirectory contains a README file with more information
on the corresponding test.  List of tests:


              . Client_Propagated

                Tests PriorityModelPolicy with
                RTCORBA::CLIENT_PROPAGATED value.


              . Server_Declared

                Tests PriorityModelPolicy with
                RTCORBA::SERVER_DECLARED value.

              . Server_Protocol

                Tests various settings of
                RTCORBA::ServerProtocolPolicy.

              . Client_Protocol

                Tests various settings of
                RTCORBA::ClientProtocolPolicy.

              . MT_Client_Protocol_Priority

                Multithreaded test with two client threads [with
                different priorities and different
                ClientProtocolPolicy Current-level overrides]
                concurrently making invocations on one object
                reference, which has a CLIENT_PROPAGATED priority
                model.
