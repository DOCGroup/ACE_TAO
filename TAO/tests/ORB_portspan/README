portspan Test
-------------

The portspan test verifies that the portspan option to the ORB_init() call
behaves correctly. This option allows you to restrict the port that a
server-side ORB will use to listen for requests, from a given range of port
numbers, starting at a given initial port.

The test works by starting a simple ORB on an endpoint with a portspan of 2.
server -ORBEndpoint iiop://:5555/portspan=2. The test script does this
three times and reports an error if the first two don't succeed or if the
third call doesn't fail.

The test accepts the following mutually-exclusive protocol arguments to
determine which protocol gets tested for portspan support. You must supply
exactly one of these arguments:

• -iiop
• -diop
