This tests the method string_to_object() of the orb, case when
string parameter is an HTTP URL from which IOR is fetched.
There are two subtests of this test which test 2 different cases
for the same string_to_object() function.

Summary:
    A client program is started and it creates its orb. For this orb
    two tests are performed on string_to_object() function with
    parameter being an HTTP URL.

    First test tests if IOR is malformed due to usage of ACE::strlen()
    function on non-zero terminated C string in HTTP_handler.cpp.

    Second test tests if IOR is properly fetched from URL when no HTTP
    headers are present in response and just IOR string is returned from
    HTTP server. To avoid bug in first test to appear in this one, HTTP
    server will return zero-terminated IOR string - will add byte 0 at
    the end of IOR.


To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
