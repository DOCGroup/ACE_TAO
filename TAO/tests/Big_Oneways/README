	This is a stress test for the non-blocking I/O features in the
ORB.  The test connects multiple peer processes together.  Each
process sends messages to all its peers, using multiple threads to
generate the messages.  Without non-blocking I/O the system soon
deadlocks.

	This is part of the regression testsuite for:

http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=132

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
