This is a compile only test. If it compiles, it's passed.

tao_idl choked on the annotation syntax of IDL4 (and DDS-XTypes)
because that syntax was unknown to its IDL grammar:

  tao_idl -Wb,pre_include=ace/pre.h -Wb,post_include=ace/post.h -I../.. -Sa -St test.idl
  syntax error
  Error - tao_idl: "test.idl", line 3: Illegal syntax following module '{' opener
  make[1]: *** [testC.h] Error 1

The first patch for this bug adds a rule in the lexer to ignore the annotations
by consuming them without action.
Actual processing of annotations is still to be done.
