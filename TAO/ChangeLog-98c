Thu Apr 16 01:25:18 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO: Change the use of time probes.  The new ACE scheme is now
 	  used.

	* tao/poa.idl: Fixed the idl file.

	* tao/PolicyS.cpp (_tao_collocated_Policy): _tao_collocated_Policy
 	  must inherit from CORBA_Policy and not from CORBA::Policy.  This
 	  is because the VC++ compiler cannot deal with inheriting from
 	  nested typedefs.

	* tao/Policy{C,S}.h: Added TAO_Export macros. Also fixed the
 	  #include files.

	* tao/POAS.*: Added code for _get_policy_type_skel() and
 	  policy_type() by hand.

	* tao/POAC.*: Removed code for PortableServer::Policy.

	* tao/POA.cpp: Added the policy_type() method to the policy
 	  classes.

	* TAO: Changed PortableServer::Policy to CORBA::Policy.

Wed Apr 15 22:29:29 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO_IDL/be/{be_visitor_structure, be_visitor_union,
	be_visitor_enum, be_visitor_sequence, be_visitor_interface,
	be_visitor_exception}.cpp: Added code to generate the <<= and >>=
	operators for CORBA::Any.

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_predefined_type.cpp: Added cases for LongLong,
	ULongLOng, and LongDouble which were missing.

Wed Apr 15 20:20:58 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer{Factory}.java.JDK1.2
          added these two files, they can be used by the JDK 1.2 instead
	  of by the Visigenic ORB.

Wed Apr 15 15:59:58 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO/tao/append.cpp: Added a bunch of methods that take a CDR
	stream and append it to another CDR stream while maintaining the
	alignment. These functions use exactly the same logic as that used
	by the encode, skip, decode, deep_free, and deep_copy methods.

	* TAO/tao/any.cpp: When we reset the contents, we set value_ to 0

	* TAO/tao/CDR.{h, i, cpp}: Added a constructor to the
	TAO_OutputCDR and TAO_InputCDR to take an ACE_Message_Block as
	input. In addition, added the "append" methods that append one CDR
	to other while maintaining the alignment.

	* TAO/tao/Exception.{h, i, cpp}: Added the definition and
	implementation of the CORBA::ExceptionList class according to the
	CORBA v2.2 (Feb 98). This required a few changes in the
	Exception.cpp file while initializing the list of system
	exceptions.

	* TAO/tao/{GIOP, IIOP_Object}.cpp: Changes required due the new
	definition of ExceptionList

	* TAO/tao/Marshal.h: Added the append methods on all classes.

	* TAO/tao/ORB.h: Chnaged the definition of ExceptionList from
	typedef to TAO_Unbounded_Object_Sequence<TypeCode_ptr> to using
	the new defintion.

	* TAO/tao/Typecode.{h, cpp}: Moved the defintions of Bounds and
	BadKind inside the TypeCode class. This is where it belongs.

	* TAO/tao/decode.cpp: In Any::decode, we set the value_ data
	member of Any to a duplicated ACE_Message_Block.

	* TAO/tao/encode.cpp: Changed the implementation of Any::encode
	such that if the Any owns the data, then the value_ which is an
	ACE_Message_Block that holds a CDR stream gets appended to the
	destination CDR. Otherwise, the value is literally encoded into
	the destination CDR.

	* TAO/tao/skip.cpp: Added WString::skip. In addition, we had
	forgotten to pass the address of the discriminant_val to the
	decoder inside the Union::skip function.

Wed Apr 15 12:19:36 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/deep_copy.cpp (deep_copy): We need a return if no error was
 	  found.

Wed Apr 15 09:28:16 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Stub.h:
	  A field was declared <const CORBA::TypeCode_ptr*>, this field is
	  needed to initialize a Sequence that requires a
	  <CORBA::TypeCode**> parameter.  The careful reader will notice
	  that there is no implicit conversion between the two types, the
	  first is a pointer to constant TypeCode_ptr no a constant
	  pointer to TypeCode_ptr.  Only SGI/C++ detected this problem.

Wed Apr 15 09:11:11 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/DynSched.cpp (compare_entry_finish_times):
          added const's to first_entry and second_entry declarations and
          casts, so that ANSI static_casts will succeed.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Strategy_Scheduler.cpp (create):
          removed extraneous trailing semicolon.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.h (ACE_RT_Task): added "class"
          to declaration of friend ACE_RT_Thread_Manager.

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.cpp (main): added an _out
          temporary to avoid compiler warning about a temporary being used
          for a non-const reference.  Because only Sun C++ seems to complain
          about this, and the temporary is non-comformant (it is an _out
          type, and users aren't supposed to create them), the hack is
          only used with Sun C++.

Tue Apr 14 19:35:50 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/*: Quoter example is running using the Cos LifeCycle
          Factory Finder.

Tue Apr 14 16:37:50 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp:
        * tao/deep_copy.cpp:
        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/Principal.cpp:
        * tao/ORB.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
        * tao/Exception.cpp:
          Removed the last traces of CORBA_SEQUENCE<T>, we use
          TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<CORBA::Octet> for CORBA::OctetSeq and
          TAO_Unbounded_Object_Sequence<T> for CORBA::ExceptionList.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp:
          It is less surprizing to receive arguments as T_ptr than as
          T_var&.
          Also followed the usual memory managment conventions of CORBA,
          i.e. we don't own the parameters we receive, but we do own the
          return values or out parameters we obtain.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          Pseudo-objects or objects passed as input parameters must be
          duplicated before storing them in a T_var variable.

Tue Apr 14 13:49:51 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        The following changes are untested.

        * TAO/tao/skip.cpp: Added a new file that can skip values in the
        CDR stream. We need this functionality so that when an Any is
        decoded, it will simply hold a pointer to the ACE_Message_Block
        (which in turn consists the incoming CDR stream). However, we
        still need to skip past the value. This skipping uses the same
        interpretive algorithm used by the encoder and decoder.

        * TAO/tao/Any.{h, cpp}: Changed the way constructors, assignment
        operators, replace method, and destructor worked. The policy is
        that if the Any owns the value, then it immediately converts the
        value to a CDR stream and destroys the value.

        * TAO/tao/CDR.{h, i}: Added some more functionality to do the
        basic "skip" operations.

        * TAO/tao/Marshal.h: Added the skip methods on all the
        TAO_Marshal_* classes.

        * TAO/tao/decode.cpp: When we decode an Any, the value pointer now
        points to the CDR stream (represented as a ACE_Message_Block). It
        is the application's responsibility to use the <<=, >>= operators
        to retrieve the right type.

        * TAO/tao/Policy{C,S}.{h,i,cpp}: Added these files that have stubs
        and skeletons for the CORBA::Policy interface.

        * TAO/tao/{ORB, corba}.h: Added definitions for the PolicyType,
        Policy, and PolicyList.

Tue Apr 14 12:27:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Use the write_*_array() and read_*_array() when
          encoding/decoding arrays or sequences into/from a CDR
          stream. Since every request has at least one sequence (the
          object key) this is a improvement for all requests.
          I was able to measure improvements in the order of 5% to 10% for
          IDL_Cubit.

        * tests/CDR/growth.cpp:
          The correct interface to accumulate measurements in a
          ACE_High_Res_Timer is start_incr()/stop_incr().

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp:
          Increased the maximum sequence size to 100, otherwise it is hard
          to notice how the sequences affect performance.

        * docs/releasenotes/ec.html:
          Added an explicit example on how to run the Event_Latency test.

        * tao/Exception.cpp:
          Fixed indentation.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp:
          An exception was not "rethrown".

Tue Apr 14 12:23:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/DynSched.cpp,Strategy_Scheduler.cpp,
          tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
          #include math.h after #including the ACE headers, to avoid a
          compile warning on ghs/VxWorks.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/DynSched.cpp (add_dependency): removed
          a break statement following a return.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/SchedEntry.h (OS_priority): removed
          name qualifier (the class name).

        * tests/Param_Test/client.cpp (run_dii_test): removed second
          return statement at end.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.{h,cpp},client.cpp
          (get_latency): cast double latency_ to u_int.

Tue Apr 14 10:23:32 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.h (TAO_ORB_Core): Moved a bunch of "set" methods
          into the public part of the class so that we can set them if
          necessary.  Also changed the "set" methods so they return the
          original pointer, which enables "chaining".  Thanks to Brian
          Mendel for point this out.

Tue Apr 14 07:16:21 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: added CONTROLLED_FILES macro.  Thanks to Doug
          for reporting this.

        * INSTALL,Makefile: removed INSTALL from CVS control.

Tue Apr 14 00:51:45 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.14 released.

Sat Apr 11 20:02:32 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.13, released Sat Apr 11 20:02:32 1998.

Sat Apr 11 10:00:09 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DOVEBrowser.java:
          modified to be used only when the DOVE Browser is running as
          an Java Application.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DOVEBrowserApplet.java:
          used when the DOVE Browser is running as an Applet.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/*: minor changes to handle
          the afore mentioned changes.

Fri Apr 10 15:11:44 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp (message_name): Fixed a missing increment by 1
          code.  Thanks to Sumedh for noticing the bug.

Fri Apr 10 10:41:04 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/tmplinst.cpp:
          Added a missing template instantiation.

Fri Apr 10 04:38:36 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typedef.cpp: The changes made by me in the
        log entry mentioned just below had some flaws. I had sort of
        blidly applied it to a case in the "visit_typedef" node of the
        be_visitor_typedef_ci class. I was resetting the alias context
        before the code generation action was taken as aooposed to doing
        it after the action was taken. Thanks to Seth Widoff for sending
        the bug report.

Thu Apr  9 21:57:52 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAS.cpp: Fixed up the POA to use the new
          ACE_Static_Allocator_Base stuff.

        * tao/Operation_Table: Added an additional parameter to the
          TAO_Dynamic_Hash_OpTable constructor so that we can pass in the
          ACE_Static_Allocator_Base.  Also, changed the code to use the
          base/member initialization section, which is more efficient.

Thu Apr  9 22:53:21 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: We now use the
        ACE_Static_Allocator_Base to define a static allocator for the
        Dynamic Operation Hash Table. Using this approach will finally
        solve the seg faults in the static destructors.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_visitor_args, be_visitor_array, be_visitor_field,
        be_visitor_exception, be_visitor_operation, be_visitor_typedef,
        be_visitor_union, be_visitor_union_branch}.cpp: The visit_typedef
        operation on all the classes in these files was setting the
        TAO_Visitor_Context's alias state to the typedef node being
        visited. However, we were not resetting this context alias state
        after the action has been taken. This broke code for a scenario
        shown in a dummy IDL below:

               typedef X Y;
               struct foo { ... };
               struct bar {
                 Y y_field;
                 long long_field;
               };
        In the code generation for the struct "bar" (for that matter for
        unions, exceptions, sequences, and others), when we are generating
        the code for the field whose type is "Y", we set the alias
        context, it gets set to Y and we use its primitive type which is X
        to do the "accept". However, we do not reset the alias context. As
        a result, when we are generating the code for the long_field, the
        alias context is still "Y" which leads our IDL compiler to
        generate code that says "Y long_field;" rather than "long
        long_field;". This is now fixed.

Thu Apr  9 20:15:41 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp (init): Added code to
        recognize the -o option to output the Naming Service ior to a file
        to avoid setting the NameService env. variable when multiple
        naming services are running.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp: Added a
        naming_service_ior () method to return the ior of the Naming
        Service.

Thu Apr  9 19:25:44 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java,
                  orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/DOVEMIB.cpp.
                  orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.cpp:
                  Had to conform to the new RtecScheduler.set ( ..) method,
                  some parameters were added.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Enhanced description of the DOVE

Thu Apr  9 10:07:34 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.i:
          Fixed warnings in convertion from 64 bit ints to 32 bit
          ints. This is a classical example of a "good" cast, we know the
          numbers will be in range (unless something *really* bad happens,
          like), so the conversion will work.

Wed Apr 08 10:02:16 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/make_release: added this script that creates ACE and/or
          TAO releases.

        * Makefile: added support for make_release.  See comments at
          the top of the Makefile.  The old release mechanism has
          been retained; to use it:  make release-old.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init): added missing __FILE__ to printout.
          Thanks to Tom Brusehaver <tgb@cozy.netco.com> for reporting
          this.

        * orbsvcs/Runtime_Scheduler.{h,i},
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Config_Scheduler.{h,i} (set):
          removed const from Criticality and Info_Type arguments.  Thanks
          to Doug and Irfan for reporting this.

Wed Apr 08 07:41:53 1998  Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/{default.bld, tao.bld}: Updated VxWorks GHS Build files.

        * orbsvcs/default.bld,
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.bld,
          orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.bld,
          orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduling_Service.bld,
          orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.bld,
          orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.bld:
              Updated VxWorks GHS Build files.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/{default.bld,IDL_Cubit.bld}:
              Updated VxWorks GHS Build files.

Wed Apr 08 00:31:08 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init): If the host is not supplied by the
          user, we will go ahead and call ACE_OS::hostname immediately.
          This will help later down the road, since ACE_OS::hostname will
          not have to be called each time an IIOP_Profile is created.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp (set): Changed the calls to get_host_addr()
          to get_host_name().  The name is more readable than the IP
          address.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init): If the user explicitly specifies
          -ORBport 0, we choose a port and start listening.  This will
          make sure that all IORs produced will be correct.  If -ORBport 0
          is not specified, lazy listening is done as usual (on
          orb->run()).

Tue Apr  7 18:25:09 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/quoter.idl: Extended the interface by a Factory
          Finder.

        * tests/Quoter/QuoterFactoryFinder.{cpp,h}: Server and
          Implementation of the Factory Finder.

Tue Apr  7 16:22:09 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          Changed a buffer size from MAXNAMELEN to MAXPATHLEN, the former
          is very small in some systems, plus the fact is that a fullpath
          can be use in that buffer, so MAXPATHLEN is the right constant.

Tue Apr 07 10:55:53 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/ss: generate port numbers based on
          uid, and set TAO_ROOT (based on ACE_ROOT) if it's not set.
          This utility should be moved, maybe up two directories?

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/{Makefile,RtecScheduler.idl,Runtime_Scheduler.*,
            Scheduler_Factor.*},
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp,Event_Channel.cpp,
            ReactorTask.cpp,
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Config_Scheduler.{h,cpp},DynSched.*,
            SchedEntry.*,Scheduler.cpp,Strategy_Scheduler.{h,cpp},
          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          merged DynSched into liborbsvcs.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched/Makefile: added.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched/DynSched_Test.cpp: builds on Suns.  And
          runs!

Mon Apr  6 14:43:13 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
          The process would crash if it was unable to resolve an address
          to a name, even though it was only used in a debugging
          message. Thanks to Keith Nicewarner <knicewar@sanders.com> for
          pointing out this.

Mon Apr 06 09:59:22 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput/tao/utils.cpp: hacked so that it will compile
          on VxWorks and Chorus.  It won't run properly, though.  The
          file should be updated to use ACE_Profile_Timer instead of
          using rusage directly.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: moved include of rules.local.GNU to after
          include of rules.bin.GNU.  Without this change, tao_idl doesn't
          get build on LynxOS.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): ACE_OS::mktemp ()
          instead of mktemp ().

Sun Apr 05 18:05:26 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/{ DOVEBrowser.java,
          DemoCore.java, PushConsumerFactory.java }:
          The Browser accepts now the parameter -ORBnameserviceior.

Sun Apr 05 10:04:57 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile: don't regenerate files using TAO's IDL compiler.
          Instead, always use what's in our CVS repository, or in the TAO
          distribution.

        * tao/Makefile: use fakesvcconf = 1 if shared_libs is not defined,
          instead of if CROSS-COMPILE is not defined.

Sat Apr 04 21:25:43 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.12, released Sat Apr 04 21:25:43 1998.

Sat Apr  4 17:43:08 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp: Removed the call to hash_.close() since
          the Hash_Map_Manager destructor handles this already.

Sat Apr  4 15:50:29 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp,
          TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_sequence.h: Added a case to
          support sequence of exceptions.

Sat Apr 04 07:45:33 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.h: don't use u_longlong_t on Suns if
          ACE_LACKS_U_LONGLONG_T is defined.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (do_priority_inversion_test):
          moved declaration of loop index "i" out of two for loops, and
          declared as u_int instead of int to prevent signed/unsigned
          comparison.

Sat Apr  4 04:26:49 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface_fwd.cpp: We were not checking if
        the node was imported. Due to this, code was getting generated for
        forward declared interfaces from "#include"d IDL files.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp: We were not calling
        "nested_type_name" while generating the return type of the
        operator [] in the sequence var class. As a result, a fully scoped
        name was getting generated instead of a relative scoped name which
        the MSVC++ compiler does not like.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception.cpp: For "typedefed" nodes, we
        were using their base types to generate the code. This is fixed.

        In addition, some files from the above and others were modified to
        correct some formatting problems in the generated code.

Sat Apr  4 00:24:01 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp: Fixed a typo where
          "i" was being defined twice in the same block of code.

Fri Apr  3 18:40:49 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp: Minor changes for
        Chorus.  Cleanup code.

Fri Apr  3 18:39:21 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/Makefile: Changed LSRC to SRC to
          match today's changes to ACE's rules.bin.GNU.

Fri Apr  3 17:43:07 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/orbconf.h:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Added configuration macros to enable swap on write, and to
          disable swap on read.
          Also increased the default size of a CDR buffer.

        * tests/CDR/Makefile:
        * tests/CDR/growth.cpp:
          Added another simple test of the CDR buffer, this one tries to
          measure performance.

Fri Apr  3 17:15:22 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: The sources that go into the compiler are
          listed in SRC, not LSRC.  This matches a change in ACE's
          include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU.

Fri Apr  3 17:07:18 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (FAKE_SVC_ENTRY):
        * tao/orbconf.h: Made minor changes to have the fake service
        configurator receive its values through macros, instead of
        changing the ".cpp" file.  Seems cleaner this way.

Fri Apr  3 15:35:39 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/client.h, client.cpp: All PropertySet
        methods and the Iterator class methods tested.

Fri Apr  3 08:59:16 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Null strings are transmitted as empty strings.
          Fixed

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:
          Ensure that CDR buffer created from the IOR string is properly
          aligned.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp:
          More checking for exceptions while decoding parameters and we
          print an error message if decoding fails.

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Only the first byte of the encapsulation stores the byte order,
          the next three bytes are ignored because the <kind> is stored as
          a long.

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Removed dead code, improve error message when decoding object
          references and fix an off by one error in ObjRef::decode.

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          When encoding Object References an encapsulated stream is
          created in place, I debugged the computation of the length for
          that stream and left some debug messages commented out.
          The support for encoding null strings and wstrings as empty
          strings is in the CDR classes, no need to duplicate the effort
          here.

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
          Cosmetic changes.

Fri Apr 03 09:01:00 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp (start_servants):
          changed local "ior_file" to "ior_f" because it shadowed
          the global and caused compile failure with g++.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp (start_servants):
          check return values of activate calls.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp (run_tests):
          added default case to switch statement.

        * tao/Sequence*.{i,cpp}: use ACE_CAST_CONST instead of const
          in reinterpret casts, to keep all compilers happy.

Thu Apr 02 15:49:16 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * tao/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.dsp: Updated project file.

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,i,cpp} (create_and_set_root_poa): Added this
          private method to create and set the root poa of the calling
          ORB_Core.
          (root_poa): Make sure this function will always return a valid
          poa pointer (thru the use of create_and_set_root_poa above.)

        * tao/ORB.cpp (resolve_poa): Moved the creation of poa into
          ORB_Core.

Wed Apr  1 23:39:04 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Util_Thread.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Util_Thread.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.h: Fixed some bugs and added
        some comments.

Wed Apr 01 22:37:59 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Default_Servant/client.cpp: Fixed options parsing.

        * tao/Servant_Base.h: Added TAO_Export to
          TAO_DynamicImplementation.

Wed Apr  1 17:33:04 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit: Cleaned up the formatting of the code
          to conform to the TAO programming style.

Wed Apr  1 11:07:53 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/VisCompFactory.java:
          Implemented a Factory pattern to generate the Visualization
          Components and the Java class loader is now used to instantiate
          the JavaBeans Visualization Components.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser, DOVEMIB and Event Supplier
          are running under NT properly.

Wed Apr 01 09:44:31 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init,fini): Removed calls to
          ACE_OS::socket_init and ACE_OS::socket_fini because they are
          taken care of by ACE already.

Wed Apr  1 09:46:53 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        The following fix was also made by Carlos simultaneously. Here is
        the reason what was going wrong.

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.cpp: In calc_nested_size_alignment_i, there
          was a bug in which we were initializing the CDR stream for
          nested parameters with an incorrect size. This was due to the
          fact that we were computing the byte order outside and then
          initializing the stream with 4 less bytes. However, the
          constructor of the TAO_InputCDR was also computing the byteorder
          using wrong locations in the bytestream. This is now fixed.

        * tests/Param_Test: Added barebones implementation to test
          Anys. This is still not complete because we still have to work
          on getting Anys in TAO to work correctly and get rid of the
          memory management problems we are having.

Wed Apr  1 09:41:07 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.cpp (calc_nested_size_and_alignment_i):
           Fixed nested strem interpretation.

Wed Apr  1 08:56:24 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Renamed ResultFromScode to TAO_ResultFromScode to avoid
          clashes with MFC functions.  Thanks to David Janello
          <djanello@cccis.com> for reporting this.

Tue Mar 31 21:01:30 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp (init): Fixed a typo.

Tue Mar 31 20:18:36 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp (TAO_Naming_Server):
        Added code to remove the IOR_Multicase event handler in the destructor.

Tue Mar 31 19:50:48 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (Cubit_Server): Removed the
        naming service unbind code from the destructor as the naming
        server is a component and not an external server. Also they will
        be destructed when the ~Cubit_Server is called.

Tue Mar 31 19:30:03 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (Cubit_Server): Added a
        check in the destructor to unbind the cubit_factory from the
        naming service.

Tue Mar 31 15:15:53 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence.h:
        * tao/Sequence.i:
        * tao/Sequence_T.h:
        * tao/Sequence_T.i:
          g++ does not like typedefs inside templates, and we were abusing
          them in the sequences.

        * tests/CDR/tc.cpp:
          Fixed formatting problems.

        * tests/Param_Test/tmplinst.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiations.

Tue Mar 31 11:10:34 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.h (String_out):  Added the infamous TAO_Export macro.

Tue Mar 31 14:38:29 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.i (replace): Make sure to cast this->buffer_
          to (T *) to make compilers like GCC happy!

Tue Mar 31 13:34:36 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp (svc): dereference
          cb_factory with .in ().

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp (start_servants): declare
          iorFile outside the conditional statement.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit.idl: added comments and RCS Id
          string.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/{client,server}.cpp: fixed priority
          assignments so that they work on all platforms.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h: fixed fabs() to negate
          the argument if less than 0.

Tue Mar 31 11:05:23 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Added constructor for encapsulated streams to the TAO_InputCDR
          class; this was causing problems on Intel machines.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          We end #if/#endif blocks using C style comments (/* */) as
          opposed to C++ style (// )

        * tao/Sequence.i:
        * tao/Sequence.cpp:
        * tao/Sequence_T.i:
        * tao/Sequence_T.cpp:
          Fixed a lot of const-correctness problems, thanks to J, Russell
          Noteworthy <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for putting me on this
          track.

        * tests/Param_Test/tmplinst.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/tests.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/param_test.idl:
          The test now includes all kind of sequences: of basic types, of
          structs, of strings, of objects; both bounded and unbounded.
          Unfortunately only compilation is verified, I still have to add
          code to verify functionality.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
          Unproper code was generated for bounded sequences of strings.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:
          Added some debug messages to verify that collocation works.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/README:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp:
          Now that the ORB supports collocation we can create a collocated
          EC, but that requires a smarter startup.
          It seems that the ECP is not receiving all the messages it
          should.
          The main purpose of the change was to verify that collocation
          works and it seems to do so.

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
          We set the flag to expect input *before* making the
          request. This alleviates (but does not solve) the problems of
          using several threads and a global ORB: in such a configuration
          it is possible that one thread is running the event loop, but
          another makes a request, if the reply is received before the
          flag is set the ORB believes it has received an out-of-order
          reply and shutdowns the connection.
          The real solution is to use the leader-follower model.

        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
          Cosmetic changes.

Mon Mar 30 21:38:32 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (fini): Added a call to ACE_OS::socket_fini ().

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp (_get_collocated_object): Changed to call
          TAO_ORB_Core_instance ()-> root_poa () instead of
          this->resolve_poa ().  Thanks to Carlos for tracing this down.

Mon Mar 30 17:59:30 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.i: Only _NOT_ specialize
          ACE_Hash_Addr<ACE_INET_Addr> when ACE needs to instantiate
          template explicitly and it is not inlined.

Mon Mar 30 13:13:07 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Fixed cast that dropped constness when only reinterpret_cast was
          needed; thanks to David Levine (levine@cs.wustl.edu) for
          detecting this.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp:
          bytes_remaining was called in a debug message (not seen in
          Solaris); thanks to Nanbor Wang (nanbor@cs.wustl.edu) for
          reporting this.

Mon Mar 30 12:28:02 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.i: only specialize ACE_Hash_Addr<ACE_INET_Addr>
          with ACE inlining enabled, to avoid link collision with the
          instantiation in Connect.cpp.

        * tao/CDR.cpp (TAO_OuputCDR ctors): rearranged initializations
          to match declaration order.

        * tao/t-sizes.cpp: #include "tao/corba.h" instead of "tao/orb.h".

Mon Mar 30 10:28:05 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Implemented new classes to manipulate CDR streams, this classes
          separate input (interpretation) and output (creation) of the
          streams; in an attempt to make the interface more robust.
          The new classes provide methods to write and read strings and
          arrays, this is currently used in very few places, but it could
          provide a big performance boost.

          The change affected the following files:

        * TAO/tao/Align.h:
        * TAO/tao/CDR.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/CDR.h:
        * TAO/tao/CDR.i:
        * TAO/tao/Connect.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/Connect.h:
        * TAO/tao/Exception.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/GIOP.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/GIOP.h:
        * TAO/tao/GIOP.i:
        * TAO/tao/IIOP_Interpreter.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/IIOP_Interpreter.h:
        * TAO/tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/ORB.h:
        * TAO/tao/Server_Request.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/Server_Request.h:
        * TAO/tao/Server_Request.i:
        * TAO/tao/Typecode.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/Typecode.h:
        * TAO/tao/decode.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/deep_copy.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/deep_free.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/encode.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/orbconf.h:
        * TAO/tao/params.h:
          In most cases it was only a matter of changing the class name
          and the method invocations.

        * tests/Param_Test/options.cpp:
          Use CORBA::string_copy instead of ACE::strdup because we delete
          the buffer with CORBA::string_free.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp:
          I limited the size of the sequences, otherwise the test time
          grows non-linearly with the number of loops.

        * tests/Param_Test/README:
          The test can also check string sequences, but the option to do
          so (-t strseq) was not documented.

        * tests/CDR/basic_types.cpp:
          The test is run several times; this is useful when trying to
          verify performance.

Sun Mar 29 03:09:17 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.{h,i,cpp}: Added an optimize_collocation_objects_
          flag to turn optimization for collocation objects on and off.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Added an initialization argument
          -ORBcollocation to make ORB aware of collocation objects or
          not.  The default is on.

        * doc/Options.html: Added documentation for -ORBcollocation.

Fri Mar 27 20:08:24 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.cpp (NS_NamingContext):
          Changed to get lock from the ORB.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Update the source file list.

        * tao/ORB.h: Added TAO_Export to class CORBA_ORB_var.

        * tao/params.cpp: Removed the extra inclusion of <params.i>.

Fri Mar 27 14:10:34 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: (also see my entry from 09:50)
          Removed explicit char * operator call, and use the conversion
          as it was before.  However, I needed to change the ?: operator to
          an if/else for AIX xlC to compile it correctly.

Fri Mar 27 13:38:04 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.{h,cpp}:
        I moved the Ior_Multicast.{h,cpp} files up a directory and changed
        the class name to TAO_IOR_Multicast. It didn't logically belong
        in the Naming directory, since other bootstrappable services
        require it.

Fri Mar 27 11:47:58 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.*,IIOP_Object.{h,cpp},Request.{h,cpp},Server_Request.*,
          Exception.*,params.*,Connect.*,default_{client,server}.*,corba.h:
          #include the .i file in the .h/.cpp files instead of corba.h.

        * tests/Demux_Test/client.cpp: #include ace/stream.h instead of
          system headers, and use ACE_OS::gethrtime () instead of
          gethrtime ().

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Reactor_Task.cpp (ACE_ES_Reactor_Task): always
          use ACE_OS::gettimeofday ().  ACE_High_Res_Timer::gettimeofday ()
          now takes an argument, so it's not compatible with what
          ACE_Timer_Queue needs.  And it didn't seem necessary to have
          separate code for VxWorks.  And the hrtimer on WIN32 is flakely
          on multiple-CPU machines.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp: added ACE_Unbounded_Set_Iterator template
          instantiation.

Fri Mar 27 09:50:52 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: Use explicit char * operator on
          cpp_path (AIX xlC requires this).  Added CVS Id.

        * tao/Sequence_T.h: Fully qualify the template type when used as a
          function return.

Fri Mar 27 04:45:46 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.h: Added two pure virtual functions
          _register_collocation and _get_collocated_servant to CORBA_ORB
          class so the derived classes have their own implementations.
          (resolve_poa,resolve_poa_current): Changed these two functions
          from private methods to protected methods.  I need to access
          them from IIOP_ORB.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.{h,cpp} (_register_collocation): Added this new
          method to record connection end points an IIOP ORB owns.
          (_get_collocated_servant): Added this new method which uses a
          passed in STUB_Object to determine whether a requested object is
          collocated or not.  If it's a collocated object, returns the
          servant of that object and we can use that to create a
          collocated object reference.
          (object_to_string): Added code to register object end point with
          IIOP ORB.
          (iiop_string_to_object): Added code to check whether a requested
          object is collocated or not and return a collocated object if it
          fits to do so.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (preconnect): Added code to register success
          preconnections to IIOP's end point repository.

        * tao/decode.cpp (TAO_Marshal_ObjRef::decode): Added code to
          optimize against collocation objects.

Thu Mar 27 10:57:02 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB: New version of the DOVE
                  MIB.

                * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README: Updated.

                * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated.

Thu Mar 26 21:24:59 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.*,corba.h (CORBA_ORB::shutdown): uninlined, so that
          ORB.i can be #included properly.

        * tao/CDR.{h,cpp},GIOP.{h,cpp},corba.h: #include the .i file
          in the .h/.cpp files instead of corba.h.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp: wrapped a couple of assignments in
          conditionals with parens.

Thu Mar 26 17:28:24 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.11, released Thu Mar 26 17:28:24 1998.

Thu Mar 26 10:07:02 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB: Checked in a first draft
          of the DOVE Management Information Base (DOVE MIB). A README
          will be available with further details.

Thu Mar 26 08:31:02 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy: We were setting the name of a sequence (named
        sequence) when the code for client header generation was
        invoked. However, in cases where we import some definitions, we
        never go into the code generation code for that type. As a result,
        such imported typedefed (a.k.a named) sequences remained
        nameless. So when the time came to emit their name, it resulted in
        a segmentation fault.

        We fix this by setting the name of the sequence in the parsing
        stage itself.

        Thanks to Torben Worm (tworm@cs.wustl.edu) for reporting the bug
        to me.

        Changed files also include y.tab.cpp and y.tab.h

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp: Minor correction to get the
        formatting right.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp: Simplified the logic of converting a
        name into a padded long array. The original logic caused problems
        on NT/PC because of its "little-endian" nature. This was causing
        the repoIDs and names (represented as longs) undergo byte
        swapping.

Thu Mar 26 06:29:09 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Marshal.{h,cpp},ORB.*,Object.{h,cpp},corba.h:
          #include the .i file in the .h/.cpp files instead of corba.h.

Wed Mar 25 22:55:02 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Servant_Base.h:
        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Collocated objects (even if their dynamic type is simply
          CORBA_Object) can use the servant to resolve the _is_a()
          calls.

Wed Mar 25 22:06:19 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.cpp: Added accessors for child/root poa.

Wed Mar 25 15:10:48 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp: In the encoding of exceptions, we were not
        encoding its repository ID. This is now fixed.

Wed Mar 25 11:11:47 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.h: use ACE_UINT32 instead of u_char for CORBA_Boolean
          with Green Hills on Chorus, to work around a compiler bug.
          The bug is revealed with accessing the root_poa, by
          TAO/tests/POA/RootPOA/RootPOA.

        * tao/ORB.{h,cpp}: changed type of open_called_ and
          should_shutdown_ flags from CORBA::Boolean to u_int, because
          they're ACE_Atomic_Ops.  This allows CORBA::Boolean to be
          a typedef of bool.  Without this change, bool would be required
          to support all of the arithmetic operations that ACE_Atomic_Op
          needs, and that's not standard.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/{clnt.cpp,logger_i.*,svr.cpp},
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/{Ior_Multicast.cpp,Naming_Utils.cpp},
          tests/Thruput/TAO/server.cpp:
          removed unnecessary #include of ace/streams.h.

        * tao/Makefile,tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile,
          tests/NestedUpcall/Makefile:
          removed CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and DCFLAGS because they duplicated
          what's already in taoconfig.mk or platform_macros.GNU.

Wed Mar 25 09:08:44 1998  Torben Worm  <tworm@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Added comment to the concurrency
        control service section. The implementation of the concurrency
        control service is discontinued due to unclear specs.

Wed Mar 25 02:36:06 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/server.cpp: Renamed tao_util.h to TAO.h.

Tue Mar 24 19:13:35 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp: There was a lot of messy code on the
        outgoing path from skeleton to the wire. Specifically, we were
        mixing system exceptions with user defined exceptions. This has
        been fixed and is under testing.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_visitor_exception, be_exception}.cpp: The generated
        typecode for Exceptions erroneously had a "tk_struct" TypeCode
        kind. This has been fixed to be "tk_except".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation.cpp: Handling of oneway operations
        in the server skeletons was buggy. It is now fixed.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_predefined_type.cpp: TypeCodes for pseudo objects
        were not getting properly generated. This is now fixed.

Tue Mar 24 14:51:33 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (gen_server_skeletons): Changed
          op_name() to operation ().

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation.cpp (visit_operation): Added a
          return statement.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp: Initialze
          TAO_Synchronous_Cancellation_Required::old_type_.

Tue Mar 24 14:07:08 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.{h, i, cpp}: Made the class compliant with
        the latest CORBA v2.2. Added some extensions. There were some
        subtle bugs related to user defined exceptions that were not being
        reported back to the caller. Modified the constructor to take a
        GIOP_RequestHeader as a parameter.

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.{h, cpp}: Removed the "struct_traverse" and
        "union_traverse" methods as they were no longer used.

        * tao/Typecode.{h, cpp}: Removed the original interpreter
        "traverse" as it is no longer used since its logic is included in
        the different encode and decode methods.

        * tao/POA.cpp: changed the usage of "op_name" to "operation" since
        that is the correct method name of the ServerRequest class
        according to the CORBA v2.2 spec.

        * tao/POAS.cpp: Massive changes made to use the new style of
        skeleton code that the IDL compiler generates

        * tao/{Servant_Base, Operation_Table}.{h, cpp}: The "_find" and
        "_bind" operations now take a "const char *opname" rather than
        "CORBA::String  &opname".

        * tao/Connect.cpp: Server_Request creation now uses the modified
        constructor.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_visitor_operation, be_interpretive}.cpp: Added
        another visitor that generates the exceptionlist for the client
        stub.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp: Change in generated code to
        use the "operation" method on class Server_Request rather than the
        non-compliant "op_name".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp: Minor correction to get some
        formatting in generated code correct.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h: Added a state for exception
        list generation

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation.h: Added a new visitor
        for exception list generation.

Tue Mar 24 11:01:33 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:  Added Stub.cpp into the project.

Tue Mar 24 07:29:20 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile,Any.{h,cpp},NVList.*,ORB.h,ORB_Core.{h,cpp},
          Stub.{h,i,cpp},Typecode.{h,cpp},corba.h:
          #include the .i file in the .h/.cpp file instead of corba.h

        * tao/ORB.cpp (wscpy): removed, because we now use ACE_OS::wscpy ()
          instead.

Mon Mar 23 19:44:11 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB: CORBA_ORB no longer inherits from IUnknown.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp (set): A valid key must be provided, else
          the function will fail.  Also removed all cases where the key
          was given a default value (of "0").

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp (QueryInterface): Removed this method.

Mon Mar 23 13:20:12 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/WeaponsVisComp.java:
          Found some uninitialized variables and fixed the problem.
          This component should now be more stable.

Mon Mar 23 10:42:12 1998  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/DynSched.{cpp,h,i}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/SchedEntry.{cpp,h,i}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Strategy_Scheduler.{cpp,h,i}

          Merged in the final round of timeline fixes from the
          files in the old scheduler directory into the ones
          in the new directory.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched/DynSched_Test.cpp

          Added directory orbsvcs/tests/Sched and checked in a
          copy of DynSched_Test.cpp, the file used to test the
          offline behavior of the dynamic scheduler locally.
          This file will serve as the basis of a real TAO test
          for the on and off line behaviors of the dynamic
          scheduler when it is fully integrated into TAO.

Mon Mar 23 09:18:12 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Makefile,orbsvcs/Event_Service/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple:
          replaced orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs with orbsvcs/orbsvcs in some
          dependencies.

        * tao/ORB.{h,cpp},tao/POA.cpp,tao/encode.cpp,
          TAO_IDL/ast/ast_generator.cpp,TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp:
          migrated to ACE_OS::WChar.  That has a size of 32 bits.
          Thanks to Irfan for this recommendation.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (wstring_copy): changed null check at beginning
          from "if (*str)" to "if (!str)".

        * tao/Sequence_T.cpp (allocbuf): added missing ; at end of
          ACE_NEW_RETURN statement.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/Makefile,lex.yy.cpp,lex.yy.cpp.diff:  replaced
          #includes of standard headers with #include of OS.h so that
          ace/config.h is #included first.  The allows config.h to
          #defined _REENTRANT before stdio.h is #included, for example.

        * tao/Makefile: marked Object_KeyC.* and POA[SC].* files as
          .PRECIOUS so that gmake avoids deleting them.  Thanks to
          Chris Cleeland for this suggestion.

Mon Mar 23 03:20:47 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.10, released Mon Mar 23 03:20:47 1998.

Mon Mar 23 01:19:19 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init): It is ok not to have a svc.conf file,
          therefore check should be:

          if (result != 0 && errno != ENOENT)

Mon Mar 23 01:17:18 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h: Moved Request.i up a notch in the corba.h file so
          that it will be defined correctly!  This obviates the need for
          Nanbor's fix below!

Sun Mar 22 23:19:42 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.cpp: Include Request.i conditionally.

        * tao/Object.h: Added macro TAO_Export to class CORBA_Object_var
          and class CORBA_Object_ptr.

Sun Mar 22 21:54:57 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface: Made full_coll_name() a NON-const
          method to work around a bug with GCC...

        * TAO/tao: Moved a bunch of inline methods from *.i files into
          *.cpp files to avoid warnings from G++.  I don't know why it
          complains but not inlining this code shouldn't matter unless we
          find that these functions get called a lot via profiling...
          Thanks to David Levine for pointing this out.

Sun Mar 22 14:04:31 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao.{dsp,dsw}: Updated Project files.

        * tao/Exception.{i,cpp}: Conditionally include its inline file.
          Added codes for copy ctor and assignment operator for
          CORBA_UserException and CORBA_SystemException.

Sun Mar 22 13:05:15 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Added comments, made some modifications, and refined some
        class definitions. Changes were made to a large number of files.

Sun Mar 22 08:00:08 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Naming_Service.h: Renamed tao_util.h to TAO.h.

        * tao: Removed the CORBA_Cls.* files (since they conflict with the
          overall naming scheme) and merged them into the ORB.h class.

Sun Mar 22 03:52:39 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (open_services): "this" may only be used
        inside a nonstatic member function.

Sun Mar 22 02:58:29 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/CORBA_Cls.{h,i,cpp}: Rename CORBA.{h,i,cpp} to
          CORBA_Cls.{h,i,cpp} because NT doesn't like the coexistance of
          corba.h and CORBA.h.

Sun Mar 22 02:39:54 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CORBA.cpp (ORB_init): made change to check for the return
        value when initializing the ORB Core instance.  Also, changed the
        TAO_Marshal::initialize() to be called before the initialization
        of standard exceptions, where we need the marshal factory for CDR
        streams.
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (TAO_ORB_Core::init): made change to check for
        the return value when initializing service configurator.
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (TAO_Resource_Factory::parse_args): changes to
        correctly parse the options for "-ORBresources" and "-ORBpoa"

Sun Mar 22 01:52:01 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CORBA.cpp: Moved TAO_Exceptions::init_standard_exceptions()
          to the beginning of ORB_init() so that we can use exceptions
          later within that function.  Thanks to Sergio for reporting
          this.

Sat Mar 21 11:00:40 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Renamed a bunch of files so that the names and
          capitalization matches precisely.

        * tao/Request.i: Created this file and moved a bunch of inline
          methods into here.

        * tao: Renamed the corbacom.* files (since we don't support COM
          anyhow) into CORBA.h and the new CORBA.i and CORBA.cpp files.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Moved the CORBA_SEQUENCE stuff back into the
          header file since it wasn't linking correctly...

        * tao/TAO_IDL: Changed all uses of do_call() to do_static_call().

        * tao: Made lots of minor enhancements to formatting and style.

        * tao: Removed the invoke.cpp file and moved its functionality
          back into iiopobj.cpp, where it belongs.

        * tao/sequence_T.i (replace): Added a cast to (T *) so compilers
          wouldn't complain!  Thanks to Sergio for pointing this out.

        * tao: Renamed IIOP_Object::do_call() to
          IIOP_Object::do_static_call() to be symmetrical with
          do_dynamic_call()...

        * tao/typecode.cpp: Due to the new reorganization of the code in
          interp.cpp we're now able to put all the CORBA_TypeCode methods
          back into typecode.cpp, where they belong...

        * tao: Added a new interp.h file and moved the TypeCode table
          intialization function into that file.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Removed the friggin' global functions

          extern void __TC_init_table (void);
          extern void __TC_init_standard_exceptions (CORBA::Environment &env);

          and put them inside of classes, where they belong...

        * tao/corbacom.cpp: Moved CORBA::ORB_init() from orbobj.cpp
          (what was it doing there) to corbacom.cpp, which is where it
          belongs!

        * tao/giop.cpp: Moved the TAO_GIOP_MsgType enum into the TAO_GIOP
          class namespace and renamed all the enums accordingly.

        * tao/except.cpp: Added except.i file to split off inlines into
          their own file.

        * tao/sequence_T.i (replace): Fixed some typos in the template
          code.  Thanks to Ben Eng <ben@jetpen.com> for reporting these.

Sat Mar 21 20:34:39 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/connect.cpp (open): fixed a bug due to wrong parens
        location.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Util_Thread.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp: added option to
        disable use of the name service.  hacked the code for platforms
        that don't support floating point math.  Added Quantify start/stop
        primitives around CORBA calls.

Sat Mar 21 17:55:40 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/test/Simulator/NavWeap.idl: removed typo

        * orbsvcs/test/Simulator/DOVEBrowser: New Demo using Java Beans
          as visualization components added. This will replace the old
          demo under orbsvcs/test/Simulator/Sim_Display. See the readme
          file under orbsvcs/test/Simulator for further details.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading_Service/TT_Info.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading_Service/TTest.idl:
        I've added the rough draft of tests that pound the Trading Service
        with a variety of method invocations.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/trader.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Makefile:
        The trader now responds to resolve_intial_references multicast
        requests with the IOR of its Lookup interface, as per the
        specification.

Fri Mar 20 21:48:47 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.9, released Fri Mar 20 21:48:47 1998.

Fri Mar 20 19:46:43 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T: Added the full complement of get_buffer(),
          replace(), and release() calls to TAO's sequences.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html (href): Reformatted the DOVE
          demo section of the release notes a bit.

Thu Mar 20 17:05:42 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Documentation about the DOVE demo

Fri Mar 20 16:21:28 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/MyFooServant.h: No need to include
          generic_servant_export.h.

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/Makefile: Added flags to the idl
          compiler so that the server library can be made as a dynamic
          library.

Thu Mar 20 16:12:42 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier:
          New Project and Workspace files for NT

Fri Mar 20 11:53:15 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.cpp: Use EventHandler_vare.in() to
          pass in a pointer.  Added explicit template instantiation
          codes.

Fri Mar 20 09:46:50 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.cpp:
          Locks are needed for the memory pool singletons; thanks to
          Thomas Venturella <tventurell@mdc.com> for detecting this.

Fri Mar 20 09:26:28 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/MyFooServant.h: added
          #include "generic_servant_export.h".

        * tao/corbacom.{h,cpp},tao/encode.cpp,tao/poa.cpp,
          TAO_IDL/ast/ast_generator.cpp,TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp:
          changed CORBA::WChar from platform-dependent type to ACE_UINT16.
          This may require casts in application code, if they use
          a native wchar_t, from wchar_t to CORBA::WChar.

Fri Mar 20 02:47:22 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp
          (create_servant_lock,create_poa_lock,create_poa_mgr_lock):
          Don't return 0 but an ACE_Null_Mutex as default.

Fri Mar 20 00:36:16 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp (dispatch_servant_i): The POA Current was not being
          setup correctly.  It was used before it was created. Fix was to
          change the order of things in dispatch_servant_i() and restored
          pre_invoke() to its original state.

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/client.cpp (main): Make sure the
          client does not crash if the user does not provide an IOR.

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/MyFooServant.h (MyFooServant): Added
          export macro so that the class gets properly included in the
          DLL.

        * TAO_IDL/GenExportH.BAT: Changed %1% to %1.

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/generic_servant_export.h: The server
          lib will now be created as a DLL instead of as a static library.
          New file was added to get the exports right.

Thu Mar 19 18:42:20 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_attribute.cpp (visit_attribute): Undefined
          variable bt to removed a compilation warning.

        * tao/server_factory.cpp (create_servant_lock):
        * tao/default_server.{h,cpp} (create_servant_lock): Added new
          method which creates a servant lock according to various
          strategies used.

Thu Mar 19 18:45:13 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/client.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AVStreams.idl (interface MMDevice):
        PropertyService's PropertySet methods have been tested in the
        AVStreams' test application. Tested using the MMDevice interface
        of the AVStreams.

Thu Mar 19 18:20:42 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README: New notes about this release

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/NavWeap.idl: New, simpler Weapons struct
          because of a Visibroker for Java 3.2 bug.

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier: Using the new
          Weapons struct.

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Sim_Display/NS_Resolve.java: Complying
          with the new Name Service lookup protocol (4 bytes instead of 2)

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Sim_Display/Display_Weapons.java:
          Using the new Weapons struct.

        * $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Sim_Display/Display_Push_Consumer.java:
          Complying with the naming conventions for the skeleton code of VB 3.2.

Thu Mar 19 10:51:22 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated entry for the property service.

Thu Mar 19 09:55:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/CDR/README:
        * tests/CDR/basic_types.cpp:
        * tests/CDR/tc.cpp:
          Added basic documentation on the purpose of the tests.

Thu Mar 19 09:26:25 1998  Torben Worm  <tworm@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Added an entry for the Concurrency
          Control Service

Thu Mar 19 08:41:27 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.cpp (new_context): replaced
          ???! with ???? in comment to avoid g++ "warning: 1 trigraph(s)
          encountered".

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Scheduler.cpp: removed two ACE_Lock_Adapter
          template instantiations because they're in tao/poa.cpp.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Runtime_Scheduler.cpp: wrapped a few return
          statements that follow ACE_THROW's with ACE_NOTREACHED.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Config_Scheduler.cpp: wrapped a couple of break
          statements that follow returns with ACE_NOTREACHED.

Thu Mar 19 05:26:10 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/typecode.cpp: In private_member_name, the return value of
        "skip_typecode ()" was incorrectly compared with TRAVERSE_CONTINUE
        rather than with a boolean value. This is now fixed.

Wed Mar 18 21:43:46 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/typecode.cpp: private_equal method had a big error. I had
        forgotten break statements after every case in the switch
        statement. So no matter what, the last result which returned
        "TRUE" used to be returned. This is now fixed.

Wed Mar 18 21:32:24 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.8, released Wed Mar 18 21:32:24 1998.

Wed Mar 18 21:26:29 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Ior_Multicast.cpp (IOR_Multicast):
          reordered initializers to match declaration order.

Wed Mar 18 20:36:46 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/CDR/basic_types.cpp: Rearranged this test file a bit to
          make it more structured.

Wed Mar 18 18:52:12 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/object.{h, cpp}: Changed the name of the method "key ()" to
        "_key ()" since this was clashing with names used by users in
        their IDl files. As such "key" is not a standard method defined by
        OMG on the class Object. Hence we must use a _ before it.

        * tao/{poa, servant_base}.cpp: Used _key instead of key as
        explained above.

Wed Mar 18 18:41:34 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/main.cpp (main): Added testcode
        for NamesIterator.

Wed Mar 18 18:33:08 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/any.cpp: There was a bug in the assignment operator whereby
        a Release was causing the Any object itself getting deleted.

        * tao/poa.cpp: Changed occurrences of "buffer ()" used on the
        object key (which is a sequence) to use "get_buffer" according to
        the latest C++ mapping.

Wed Mar 18 18:32:04 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.h: Fixed some allocation
        errors and added synchronization mechanism for static internal
        data structures.  Also fixed an undefined symbol due to templates
        not being instantiated.

Wed Mar 18 17:22:40 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T.h: Renamed buffer() to get_buffer() to confrom to
          orbos/98-01-11.

        * tao/sequence[_T].*: Added the get_buffer(), release(), and
          replace() methods defined by the proposed orbos/98-01-11
          specification.

Wed Mar 18 16:54:33 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.cpp (next_n): Changed ACE_NEW
          to ACE_NEW_RETURN.

Wed Mar 18 16:39:40 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.{h,cpp}: * tao/params.{h,cpp}: * tao/orbcore.cpp:
          Expanded the resolve initial references protocol to include
          bootstrappable services other than the Naming Service. Now, the
          multicast message includes a field identifying the target
          service. The values for this field are defined in orbobj.h --
          currently there are only TAO_SERVICEID_NAMESERVICE, and
          TAO_SERVICEID_TRADINGSERVICE. For completeness I've added for
          the -ORBtradingserviceior and -ORBtradingserviceport command
          line parameters.

        * orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming/Ior_Multicast.cpp:
          Now, on the receiving end, the bootstrappable service compares
          the service_id it receives in the multicast message with its own
          before responding to it.

Wed Mar 18 16:04:38 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosPropertyService.idl (CosPropertyService):
          Uncommented sequence of typecodes. It passed the tao_idl
          compiler.

Wed Mar 18 07:18:08 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * release.pl: uncommented unlink of .del files.

        * tao/encode.cpp (TAO_Marshal_String::encode): #if 0'd unused
          local "continue_encoding".

        * tao/sequence{,_T}.cpp: removed some more "meaningless" const
          modifiers from casts.

        * tao/typecode.cpp (private_equal): wrapped a break with
          ACE_NOTREACHED.

        * tao/corbacom.h: changed CORBA_Boolean to u_char.  Thanks
          to Seth and Carlos for pointing out that this will conform
          to the standard.

        * tao/cdr.i: removed operator <</>> for CORBA::Boolean _with_
          ACE_HAS_BOOL.  No ACE platform currently #defines ACE_HAS_BOOL,
          and this will prevent divergence of TAO code if any do in the
          future.

Wed Mar 18 02:08:55 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/client.cpp (~Param_Test_Client): Removed
          releasing of the Param_Test pointer.  It is owned by the Driver
          class.

Tue Mar 17 23:28:59 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.h (POA): Changed the LOCATION_RESULT enum from protected
          to private.

Tue Mar 17 13:20:05 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit (print_stats): with
          ACE_LACKS_FLOATING_POINT, multiply calls/usec by 10^6 to get
          calls/sec.  And, use call_count_ instead of hard-coded 1000.

        * tao/orbconf.h,interp.cpp: renamed TAO_ALIGNMENT_MAGIC_NUMBER to
          TAO_MAXIMUM_NATIVE_TYPE_SIZE.

        * tao/sequence.i,sequence_T.{i,cpp}: removed "const" from some
          ACE_reinterpret_casts, because ghs warned that it's "meaningless".

        * tao/cdr.*,decode.cpp (get_encapsulation): changed type of second
          arg from size_t to CORBA::ULong for platform independence.

Tue Mar 17 11:26:28 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
          Fixed return value for operator[] in sequences of basic types,
          the _out and _var classes generated non-nested types. Thanks to
          Frak. J. Hodum <fhdum@std.saic.com> for reporting this problem.

Tue Mar 17 10:25:46 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_attribute.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface_fwd.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_attribute.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_union.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_structure.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch.cpp:
          Some export macros were missing; also fixed minor formatting
          problems.

Mon Mar 16 18:26:51 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Default_Servant/File_i.cpp (open): Fixed string being
          passed to create_reference_with_id(). The test now works.

        * tao/poa.cpp (find_servant): Added new method to the POA. It
          finds and returns the servant related to the key passed by the
          user.

Mon Mar 16 15:27:21 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
          The _narrow() method is more careful about collocation: the
          servant could return 0 on the call to _downcast (for instance if
          the servant is using DSI or is implementing the default servant
          posicies), in such a case a remote object is created.
          Generate the _interface_repository_id() method in all classes.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_module.cpp:
          In some cases the export macros were not generated.

        * tao/object.h:
        * tao/object.cpp:
          Added a new method to get the interface repository id (only
          locally).

        * tao/servant_base.cpp:
          Removed some dead code.

Mon Mar 16 14:28:34 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: cleaned up #define of TAO_ALIGNMENT_MAGIC_NUMBER,
          to allow it to be overridden.

Mon Mar 16 10:47:08 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/cdr.h:
        * tao/cdr.i:
        * tao/cdr.cpp:
          The CDR stream class exposed its implementation completely, this
          change is the first attempt to close that interface and make it
          safer.  The internal representation was changed to a
          Message_Block, so CDR could eventually create chains of
          Message_Blocks (minimizing buffer copies and using writev() for
          output).
          The next step is to split the class in an input and output
          interface, following the Java IDL model.

        * tao/typecode.cpp:
          This files were modified to use (or generate, in the case of the
          IDL compiler) the new CDR stream class interface.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_type.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp:
          It used a static buffer to evaluate be_type::nested_type_name(),
          it was changed for a per-class buffer, but the real solution is
          to allocate a buffer on the fly and return it to the user, maybe
          using UTL_String will solve the problem.

        * tests/Makefile:
        * tests/CDR/Makefile:
        * tests/CDR/basic_types.cpp:
        * tests/CDR/tc.cpp:
          Added some simple tests to verify that CDR streams work
          correctly.

        * taoconfig.mk:
          The clean target is defined in ACE config files.

        * docs/orbsvcs.html:
          Included documentation on the collocation services.

        * docs/releasenotes/ec.html:
          Moved some of the changes from "new in this release" to "changes
          in previous releases".

Sun Mar 15 22:36:08 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Admin.*
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Lookup.*
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Policies.*
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Policy_Manager.*
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterator_Collection.*
        Added the logic to perform federated queries. At this point I'm
        halting further coding of the Trading Service to concentrate on
        testing and debugging. The only portion of the specfication left
        unimplemented is the Proxy interface, which isn't of immediate
        practical use anyway.

Sun Mar 15 07:56:02 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field.cpp
          (be_visitor_field_cs::visit_sequence): made int return type
          explicit.

Sun Mar 15 06:18:58 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/{be_codegen, be_visitor_args}.h: Added a new
        state called "POST_MARSHAL_SS" i.e., to do post processing after
        the marshaling of return, inout, and out parameters is done in a
        server skeleton. Added new visitor class to the argument visitors.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_visitor_args, be_visitor_operation,
        be_interpretive}.cpp: Code for post processing after marshaling in
        the server skeletons. This was required to support object
        references.

Sat Mar 14 19:28:50 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field.cpp: Added a case for handling
        anonymous sequences in the client stub visitor. The header file
        was also changed.

Sat Mar 14 19:29:00 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp (print_stats): added
          support for ACE_LACKS_FLOATING_POINT.

Sat Mar 14 16:40:05 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation.cpp: We were not generating the
        "_get_" and "_set_" prefixes for operations corresponding to
        attributes. This is now fixed.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_enum.cpp: Typecode implementation of enum
        class was not getting generated due to an incorrect "if"
        condition. Thanks to Seth Widoff for noticing this.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch.cpp: We had forgotten to
        generate the "set" and "get" operation implementation for union
        members that are sequences. Thanks to Seth Widoff for noticing
        this.

Sat Mar 14 02:48:55 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile (IDL_FILES): Added the SFP IDL files
        and the AV/sfp.cpp to the rules.

Sat Mar 14 02:17:34 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/*.*:
        I've hammered out a number of errors from the initial port:
        the Trading Service compiles on Solaris.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        I've added all the necessary additions to the Makefile for the
        Trading Service. The makefile will perform the compilation when
        the 'trader' flag is set to 1 on the command line.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/trader.cpp:
        trader.cpp instantiates a Trader object and registers its Lookup
        interface with the bootstrapped Naming Service. All the Trader
        interfaces are implicitly activated in the Trader class. In the
        future we'll want to have the Trading Service bootstrappable
        through the resolve_initial_references method.

Sat Mar 14 00:36:30 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp (define_property):

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.h (PropertyNamesIterator):

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosProperty_Hash.cpp (CosProperty_Hash_Value):

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosProperty_Hash.h:
        The tao_idl compiler has been made to generate Any at some places
        where it was generating Any_var. Hence, I had to modify this
        implementaion to accomadate this change.

Fri Mar 13 10:34:15 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation.cpp: For return types that are
        object references, we were using the actual return type and
        passing its address to the marshaling routine. However, the
        marshaling routine needs the address of the base class i.e.,
        CORBA::Object. Due to "public virtual" inheritance all kinds of
        crazy things happen. So now we had to resort to declaring the
        return value of type "CORBA::Object_ptr" and things worked fine.

Fri Mar 13 09:57:51 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.h: use types of known sizes, such as ACE_UINT32
          and ACE_INT16, instead of native types for Boolean, Short,
          UShort, Float, and Double.

Thu Mar 12 21:23:10 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/debug.cpp (_dmsg_x): Changed ex->id () to ex->_id ().

Thu Mar 12 20:40:09 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput/TAO/client.cpp:
        * tests/Thruput/TAO/run_client:
        * tests/Thruput/TAO/run_server:
        * tests/Thruput/TAO/run_test: Minor fixes in the scripts and usage
        message.

Thu Mar 12 18:02:06 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/request.cpp:
        * tao/typecode.cpp:
        The is_nil methods of typecode and CORBA had this:
        (CORBA::Boolean) ptr == 0 to test for the nil condition, when we
        really want this: (CORBA::Boolean) (ptr == 0). This way we cast
        the result of the expression, and not the pointer, to
        CORBA::Boolean.

Thu Mar 12 17:49:45 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_visitor_typedef.cpp: For typedefs of pseudo object
        types, we had forgottten to generate a typedef to the _ptr type.

Thu Mar 12 17:21:32 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp: Fixed a couple of weird bugs were freebuf
          (MAX) was being called instead of freebuf (tmp).  Thanks to
          Keith Nicewarner <knicewar@sanders.com> for reporting this.

Thu Mar 12 15:53:44 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/except.h: Changed the member functions "type ()" and "id ()"
        on the CORBA::Exception class to "_type ()" and "_id ()". This
        affected the following files:
        tao/{except, object, poaC, svrrqst}.cpp

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception.cpp: Made changes to use the
        _type and _id methods. Thanks to Seth Widoff for noticing this in
        his Trader application where a user defined exception had a member
        called "type" which clashed with the base class operation "type".

Thu Mar 12 15:00:47 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception.cpp: In those cases where object
        references or strings were assigned, the g++ compiler failed to do
        implicit conversion to assign a _var to a _ptr type. This is now
        fixed by using the _var.in () method.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typedef.cpp: Fixed a bug that was
        generating typecode information for data types that were imported
        resulting in a multiply defined symbol error at link time.

Thu Mar 12 09:01:43 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: added -Wno-unused to g++ CCFLAGS to
          suppress warnings about unused parameters and variables.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp
          (be_visitor_interface_sh::visit_interface,
           be_visitor_interface_collocated_ss::visit_interface):
          changed type of loop index "i" to signed, to avoid
          signed/unsigned comparison.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp
          (be_visitor_sequence_ci::visit_sequence): made int return
          type explicit.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (~Cubit_Server): changed
          root_poa_ to poa_.

Thu Mar 12 01:03:17 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/NewPOA/NewPOA.cpp (main): Updated the following files
          to correctly use CORBA::Policies that are used to create new
          POAs.  Things that needed fixing included proper exception
          handling and making sure to destroy the policies once we were
          through using them.

          - TAO/tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/server.cpp

Wed Mar 11 21:02:13 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/svrrqst.cpp (marshal): instead of declaring a new loop
          index "i", use the one at outer scope because it was shadowed.

Wed Mar 11 18:10:47 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp: Added new visitor files into the project.

Wed Mar 11 17:23:49 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_util: Changed the name of root_poa_ to poa_ since it
          doesn't have to be a root POA.

Wed Mar 11 14:37:08 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: Included be_visitor_exception.cpp and ran make
        depend

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interpretive.cpp: The factory is now able to
        produce concrete visitors for exceptions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_args.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_args.h: Added a method
          "void_return_type" that determines if the operation return type
          was "void" or not. This was necessary since we were incorrectly
          generating ACE_NEW_RETURN statements in stubs for cases that had
          void return types

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_context.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_context.h: Added a boolean data
          member that indicates whether we are generating the special
          constructor in the exceptions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception.h: Added  various visitors for
          exception handling.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_{struct, union, module, interface,
        sequence}.cpp: Made sure that code is not generated for imported
        types.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typedef.cpp: Eliminated the multiple
        declaration of typedefed variables and their typecodes.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp: The "_is_a_skel" now uses
        the same table driven approach as the other skeletons do.

Wed Mar 11 12:54:59 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): The server was
          changed to test how the POA handles a user given ID which does
          not contain printable characters.

        * tao/poa (Policies and Currents): Since Policies and Currents do
          not have locality constraints, they now inherit from regular
          servants rather than local servants.  This change causes them to
          register with POAs when their _this() method is invoked.
          Therefore, the destroy() methods on the Policies was changed to
          make sure that the Policies are deactivated from the POA they
          were registered with.

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp (operator=): The semantics of the elements of
          a sequence are the same as that of a var variable.  Therefore we
          will not duplicate the user provided pointer before assigning it
          to the internal variable.  However, we will release it.

Tue Mar 10 16:09:56 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/cdr.{h,cpp}: Added a get_string and put_string method for
        retrieving and encoding a string. This uses "memcpy" rather than
        having to go through a get_char/put_char for every byte of the
        string.

        * tao/connect.cpp: In "handle_request", the marshaling of inout,
        out, and return value parameters was done inside this method after
        the operation skeleton had returned. This required unnecessary
        heap allocation of these parameters. Allocating these parameters
        on the skeleton call stack was not possible since the marshaling
        took place after the skeleton had returned. To eliminate these
        unnecessary waste, 2 new methods on the ServerRequest class are
        added that perform the demarshaling and marshaling while the
        skeleton call stack is active. More explanation on these is given
        below.

        * tao/{encode, decode}.cpp: Used the get_string and put_string
        methods on the CDR class.

        * tao/giop.*: Added a method called "stream" that returns a
        reference to the underlying CDR stream. This is helpful when you
        need access to the stream so that data types can be marshaled into
        the stream using a compiled form of marshaling. This form of
        marshaling will soon be added to TAO IDL compiler.

        * tao/object.{h, cpp}: Added a method called "stubobj" which
        returns a pointer to the underlying Stub_Object. This method
        eliminates the need to call QueryInterface inside every stub. This
        way some code size is reduced.

        Also, removed the "get_most_derived" method as well as the "void
        *sub_" data member which was useless.

        * tao/svrrqst.{h, i, cpp}: Added a new file svrrqst.i. Added two
        new methods on class IIOP_ServerRequest. These methods enable
        demarshaling and marshaling of parameters while the operation
        skeleton's call stack is active. The interface to these methods is
        exactly like the one used by do_call i.e., a table driven
        approach. Two new data structures - TAO_Param_data_Skel and
        TAO_Call_Data_Skel are added. These two tables behave in exactly
        the same way as the TAO_Param_Data and TAO_Call_Data tables. See
        the generated code to see how these are used by the demarshal and
        marshal methods.

        Two more methods and data members are added to this class -
        "incoming" and "outgoing". These are the CDR streams that indicate
        the incoming and the outgoing CDR streams.

        An additional "init_reply" method is added that is useful for the
        compiled marshaling. This is still experimental.

        * TAO_IDL: This is the first release of the new TAO_IDL compiler
        based on the Visitor pattern. All the old files and code is still
        included in this release until the transition is complete.

        Although the Visitor pattern is used, we still maintain all the
        code generation states we had in the previous version of the
        compiler. The reason is that we maintain a Factory of Visitors
        indexed on these enumerated states. The downside is the necessity
        to have states and a larger code size. The larger code size is due
        to the fact that everytime a Visitor is required, we must first
        set the appropriate state and then ask the factory to produce it
        for us. The positive side of this design is that almost all the
        Visitor files are independent of each other. They only deal with
        an abstract base level Visitors. The Factory will produce the
        appropriate specialized Visitor which is a subclass of the base
        "visitor" class. An additional benefit is that we can switch from
        having to generate code that uses Interpretive marshaling to
        compiled marshaling. Visitors for compiled marshaling will be
        added later. Here are the files that are added:

        be_include/
                be_visitor.h
                be_visitor_args.h
                be_visitor_attribute.h

        NOTE: Code generation for attributes is achieved by using a crude
        form of the Adapter pattern. We convert the Attribute node into
        one or possibly two operation nodes and add scope elements that
        are arguments. The code gene ration is then handed over to the
        Operation Visitors.

        * be/be_interpretive.cpp: This file defined the implementation of
        the Factory of Visitors for intepretive marshaling.

        * be_include/be_codegen.h: Added a few more states. Some others
        are now useless. They will be removed eventually. Also added the
        Abstract Factory for Visitors.

        * Makefile: Modofoed to include all the visitor files and ran
        "make depend" on it.

Tue Mar 10 13:22:20 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Makefile: removed -pedantic
          from g++ CCFLAGS because prevented use of native long long
          (Linux/i386).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecScheduler.idl: addressed RT_Info open issues,
          and updated to match TAO paper.  The updates consisted of
          changing the names of the Importance enum values so that we
          don't have collisions when criticality is added, and comment
          updates.

        * orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp,ReactorTask.cpp,
          orbsvcs/Sched/Config_Scheduler.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_{Con,Sup}.cpp:
          added _IMPORTANCE to Importance enum values.

Mon Mar 09 22:27:53 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/client.cpp: Added code to time calls
          and produce stats.

        * tao/svrrqst: Removed the lock in CORBA_ServerRequest which was
          used to protect the refcount. This protection was excessive.

        * tao/optable.cpp: Changed the table so that it does not use a RW
          Lock. Since the optable is read only, a null lock will suffice.

        * tao/objtable.cpp: Changed the implementation of
          TAO_Dynamic_Hash_ObjTable so that it does not use a RW Lock. The
          POA takes care of all necessary locking, and therefore, a null
          lock will suffice.

        * tao/poa: The following optimizations were made to decrease the
          time a POA takes to find a servant:

          - Added new classes TAO_Creation_Time and
            TAO_Temporary_Creation_Time.  These classes are used to record
            and compare the creation time of POAs. The old method was
            inefficient as unsigned long were used.  These long required
            conversions to strings.  The new scheme uses a fixed size
            buffer. The TAO_Temporary_Creation_Time is a special class
            that tracks the creation time only during the lifetime of the
            upcall.

          - parse_key_permanent_id() and parse_key_temporary_id() were
            added so that the parse_key() routine can distinguish when to
            create a new id and when to create a special id which is only
            used during the lifetime of the upcall.

          - rfind() was added so that the TAO_POA::String::rfind() does
            not have to be used.

          - Changed the object_key_type from String to char.

          - In post_invoke(), only create the POA_var if necessary.

          - Changed create_object_key() and parse_key() so that the old
            format of:

            Transient/Seconds/MicroSecond/POAName/ObjectId

            to:

            T/TimeStampPOAName/ObjectId

          - Removed excessive memcpy() and strcpy() calls in parse_key().

          - Changed create_object_id() to not include the POA name.

          - Changed is_poa_generated_id() to take the changes to
            create_object_id() into account.

          - Changed string_to_ObjectId() and ObjectId_to_string() to not
            use encode and decode routines.

Mon Mar  9 15:23:19 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server/server.cpp (open):
        Temporarily disabled use of threads, and reverted back to the
        forking model. The threaded model needs more work before it can
        safely support multiple clients.

Mon Mar  9 14:57:13 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Removed the _narrow_fixup() method, it was causing problem with
          sequences of TypeCodes and it is not really needed: the
          functionality can be implemented in the stubs (skeletons) and/or
          the >>= methods.

Mon Mar 09 09:59:01 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp: removed
          VxWorks-specific code, because it was no longer used, and
          relied on a header that was not distributed with TAO.

Sat Mar 07 12:14:58 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.7, released Sat Mar 07 12:14:58 1998.

Sat Mar  7 11:59:27 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (get_root_poa): Changed this from being a
        macro-implemented method to a hand-implemented method.  This is
        necessary b/c the location of its resource is keyed not off
        resource_source_ but rathe off poa_source_, and there's no macro
        avaialble for that.  Thanks to John Geiss <jtgb@eci-esyst.com> for
        reporting the bug that led to this fix!

Sat Mar 07 08:29:51 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (TAO_Default_Reactor ctor and dtor): removed
          inline qualifiers.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile: changed -lm to $(MATHLIB).
          It looks like Sun C++ and g++ link with -lm by default, so
          there shouldn't be any affect on those platforms.  Others may
          have to define MATHLIB in their platform_macros.GNU.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (do_priority_inversion_test):
          changed variables low_client and high_client to low_priority_client
          and high_priority_client.  Replaced use of cerr with ACE_DEBUG.

Fri Mar  6 17:56:25 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Aloha: I bid fond farewall to Team TAO for now.  Thanks for the
        fun times!

        * tests/NestedUpcall/server.cpp: Integrated new stuff.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.cpp: Called new 'stop' method.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/{Reactor.idl,reactor_i.*}: Added 'stop' to Reactor
        interface to shutdown the server.

        * tao/tao_util.cpp: Added code to explicitly destroy policies
        after creating a child POA.

        * tao/poaS.h: Added a little comment to bring this up in C++ mode
        in emacs.

        * tao/poa.cpp: Performed explicit deletes on buffers.

        * tao/object.{cpp,i}: Moved DTOR into .cpp and stuck in comment
        explaining refcount semantics on CORBA_Object.

        * tao/iiopobj.i: Changed initial refcount value to zero; the ORB
        Core must perform an explicit AddRef() if it intends to hold on to
        this object.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: Changed Release() so that it will call 'delete
        this' whenever the refcount is below zero.

Fri Mar 06 11:38:38 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Shrinked the table widths to 80% so we can
          see everything without scrolling.  Thanks to Darrell for the
          HTML tip.

Fri Mar 06 09:36:47 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/object.i (CORBA_Object): reordered initializers to match
          declaration order.  Also, move _set_parent () before the
          constructor so that it is defined before being used.

        * tao/cdr.{i,cpp}: modified to base in/out operations
          on ULongLong instead of LongLong, because we have
          better support for ULongLong with ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T.

        * tao/cdr.{h,cpp} (get_ulonglong): removed const argument qualifier.

Fri Mar 06 00:18:38 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poaS and poaC: Removed about a 1000 lines of stubs and
          skeletons code from poaC.cpp and poaS.cpp.  This code was not
          necessary because of the locality constraints on certain POA
          objects. This should help reduce the footprint of TAO.

Thu Mar  5 19:54:27 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.cpp: bind_context, rebind,
        and bind were fixed to handle errors more carefully.  Thanks to
        Mark Boriack for pointing this out.

Thu Mar  5 18:15:32 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp: Removed crufty unused code.

        * tao/iioporb.cpp:
        * tao/iiopobj.*:
        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/object.{h,i}:
        * tao/orbobj.cpp:
        * tao/poaC.cpp:
        * tao/request.cpp:
        * tao/servant_base.{h,cpp}:
        Broke the old, incestous, bizarre "contained" relationship between
        IIOP_Object and CORBA_Object.  Now, multiple CORBA_Objects can
        reference the same IIOP_Object, and each is reference-counted
        separately.  Moreover, an IIOP_Object has no back-pointer to a
        CORBA_Object.  All of this should help alleviate many memory
        leaks.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Changed emitted code for _narrow
        and _bind to deal with new relationship btw. CORBA_Object and
        IIOP_Object.

Thu Mar  5 17:45:28 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/cdr.i:
          If CORBA::WChar is an alias for CORBA::Short we cannot overload
          operator<< on it.

        * tao/corbacom.h:
        * tao/typecode.h:
          MSVC++ does not like a class forward declared as a structure.


        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile:
          -lm is required in IRIX.

Thu Mar 05 16:18:53 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp (ObjectId_to_wstring and ObjectId_to_const_wstring):
          Changed the odd looking access to a sequence's buffer to use the
          new buffer() accessor.

Thu Mar  5 13:15:37 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/cdr.h:
        * tao/cdr.i:
          Added a error flag to the class and some << and >> operators to
          start a more useable interface for the CDR streams.

        * tao/any.h:
        * tao/any.cpp:
        * tao/except.h:
        * tao/except.cpp:
        * tao/nvlist.h:
        * tao/nvlist.cpp:
        * tao/principa.h:
        * tao/principa.cpp:
        * tao/request.h:
        * tao/request.cpp:
        * tao/typecode.h:
        * tao/typecode.i:
        * tao/typecode.cpp:
          They don't inherit from IUnknown any more. Removed the
          QueryInterface method, but kept AddRef and Release to keep the
          change propagation to a minimum.
          In accordance to the new memory managment scheme the locks were
          also removed, the agument is:
          + In the common case the locks are *not* needed.
          + When needed a lock at that level does *not* work.
          + The application can add its own locking for the objects that
          are effectively shared among threads.

        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Sequences of objects require some post processing *after*
          demarshalling: the object references must be narrowed to the
          right type; a new virtual method was added for that purpose.

Thu Mar 05 09:08:09 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * .../Makefile:  added $(POSTLINK) to link commands.
          Please, if you don't use rules.bin.GNU, be sure to
          follow it as closely as possible.

Wed Mar 04 19:49:31 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core (preconnect): changed type of loop index to
          size_t to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.  Added some
          template instantiations.

Wed Mar  4 16:35:37 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.*: Added an extension to the CORBA_ORB interface
        that allows an application to preconnect to multiple servers by
        specifying a string of host:port pairs.

        * tao/orb_core.*: Broke the preconnection logic out of init()
        and made it its own method, preconnect().  This also uses
        Connector<>::connect_n() rather than implementing its own loop.
        It really didn't make things much easier, but we can take
        advantage of future improvements to that implementation
        transparently, now.

        * docs/Options.html: Added more details on various options.

Tue Mar 03 21:11:22 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecScheduler.idl: updated a comment: the units
          of Period are 100 ns.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp (initialize_queues),
          Task_Manager.cpp (initialize): maintain period in units of 100 ns
          when converting period from a 64 bit to a 32 bit int.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp (open_queue),
          ReactorTask.cpp (open_reactor): assign name to thread using units
          of us.

Mon Mar  2 19:01:44 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/main.cpp (class
        TAO_PropertySet_Tester): Added this wrapper class to organise my
        test code, testing the methods in the PropertyService interfaces.

Mon Mar  2 16:48:59 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          More changes attempting to remove the \ problem for NT.

        * tao/orbobj.h:
          Added a missing TAO_Export macro.

        * tao/typecode.h:
        * tao/typecode.i:
          Added the _var and _out classes for CORBA_TypeCode.

        * tao/corbacom.h:
          Added the TypeCode_var and TypeCode_out classes to the CORBA
          class.

Mon Mar  2 15:39:57 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T.h: Added a ptr() accessor to both the
          TAO_Bounded_Sequence and TAO_Unbounded_Sequence classes.  Thanks
          to Carol Sanders <csanders@mdc.com> for suggesting this.

        * tao/sequence[_T].{i,cpp}: Cleaned up a bunch of
          ACE_reinterpret_cast() operations.  Thanks to Russ Noseworthy
          <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for reporting this.

Mon Mar  2 13:13:19 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:
          Fixed pathname canonization for NT, we convert a double
          backslash into a single slash.

Mon Mar 02 08:00:41 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: only instantiate ACE_Convert with g++.
          Even that shouldn't need it, because it's always inline.
          But, g++ typically creates out-of-line instantiations of
          inline template member functions.

        * tao/sequence.{h,cpp} (TAO_{B,Unb}ounded_Base_Sequence):
          added (virtual) destructors.  Without them, GreenHills on
          Chorus was duplicating their vtables when instantiating
          templates based on those classes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile,tmplinst-orbsvcs.cpp:
          renamed tmplinst.cpp to tmplinst-orbsvcs.cpp to avoid mangled name
          collisions with tmplinst.cpp in test directories, when using
          GreenHills/Chorus.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (main): added explicit
          int return type.

Sun Mar  1 13:42:56 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * release.pl: This script will now move the 'Current' tag to
          point to the latest beta release.

Sun Mar  1 10:40:31 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{poa, objtable}.cpp: Removed the "Anachronism" warning
        associated with the _out parameters passed to the find () method.

Sat Feb 28 18:37:54 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosProperty_Hash.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosProperty_Hash.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/main.cpp:
        Added some more code to test the functions defined in CosPropertyService_i.cpp.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosPropertyService.idl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile (DIRS): Added the directory
        CosPropertyService under DIRS  here. It is compiled when av=1.

Fri Feb 27 19:55:09 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/IDL_Cubit_Test.cpp (main): Added this
        file which spawns the server and client and terminates them after
        some time.

Fri Feb 27 17:57:55 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/server.cpp: Started integrating the
        TAO_ORB_Manager, but it's untested thus far so it's
        conditionally-compiled out.

        * tao/{any,connect,default_server,except,
        orb_core,orbobj,principa,request}.cpp: Whacked out a bunch of @@

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: update to naming service
        entry.

Fri Feb 27 15:03:58 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html (TAO_Default_Server_Strategy_Factory): Added
        documentation for POA-related lock strategies.

        * tao/connect.cpp (handle_input): Added call to
        Reactor::suspend_handler() in here so that, in the bizarre corner
        case where sub-event loop "A" eventually leads to sub-sub-event
        loop "B" being called, but input becomes available for "A"'s
        descriptor prior to "B"'s descriptor, B's loop won't spin wildly,
        gobbling up CPU.

Fri Feb 27 15:00:42 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.i (hrtime_to_TimeT): with
          ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T, set the high word directly.  The
          ACE_U_LongLong operator >> returns an ACE_U_LongLong,
          so the assignment won't work otherwise.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: added ACE_Convert (const char *, u_int &)
          instantiation.

Fri Feb 27 12:08:19 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * test/NestedUpcall/{eh_i,reactor_i}.cpp: Changed debug statements
        to utilize the new ACE_Log_Msg conversions to indent scopes, etc.

Fri Feb 27 00:40:36 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.6, released Fri Feb 27 00:40:36 1998.

        The Trading Service has a new home and a new orb. I've migrated
        the VisiBroker implementation of the Trading Service to TAO by
        having the interfaces inherit from the POA_CosTrading skeletons,
        replacing the the C++ exception handling with the TAO_* macro
        exception handling and CORBA::Environment passing, and prefixing
        all top level classes with 'TAO_'. Because the tao_idl generated
        code from CosTrading.idl was having some trouble, nothing here has
        been compiled since the port. The README file contains additions
        to the Makefile necessary to accommodate the Trading Service's
        reliance on STL.

        The orbsvcs/Trading_Service/trader.cpp is a server that activates
        the supported interfaces of our Trading Service. At this point our
        Trader adheres to the Stand Alone Trader designation of
        conformance as described in the specification.

Thu Feb 26 18:38:56 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp (TAO_Naming_Server):
          Fixed a syntax error.

Thu Feb 26 18:07:16 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Added an entry for the Property Service.

Thu Feb 26 17:36:21 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.{h,cpp} (TAO_Default_Reactor): I added the new class
          tring to strategize the type of reactor used.  It is not used at
          the moment.

Thu Feb 26 16:18:47 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (gen_client_stubs): Split out some
          code to use a couple temporary variables to work around what
          might be a Heisenbug with GCC.  Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan and
          Keith Nicewarner <knicewar@sanders.com> for reporting this.

Thu Feb 26 14:52:20 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/{eh_i,reactor_i}.{h,cpp}: Added
        implementation for the new decrement operation.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.cpp: Added calls to invoke the new
        decrement operation.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/Reactor.idl: Added a new operation,
        decrement, to test multi-nested upcalls.

        * tao/connect.cpp (send_request): Fixed to return appropriate
        return values, especially in case of errors.

Thu Feb 26 14:02:36 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_util.cpp (activate_under_child_poa): Instead of
          returning a String_var, return String_var._retn ().
          (activate_under_child_poa): Actually, it seems better just
          use String than String_var.

Thu Feb 26 13:31:06 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: added "all" target for CROSS-COMPILE platforms.

Thu Feb 26 05:39:43 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.cpp: Cast (char *) to 0 which is used
          to initialize remote_reactor_key.
          (main): Added ACE_const_cast in string_to_object call.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/NestedUpcall.dsw:
        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.dsp:
        * tests/Nestedupcall/server.dsp: New project files for NT.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (init_naming_service,main):
          Appended a return at the end.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.dsp: Updated project file
          lists.

        * tao/TAO.dsp: Added tao_util.cpp into this project.

        * tao/tao_util.h (TAO_ORB_Manager): Added TAO_Export flag.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Added Ior_Multicast.cpp and
          Naming_Utils.cpp into this project.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Ior_Multicast.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.h: Added
          TAO_ORBSVCS_Export flag.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp: Added a return
          statement to muffle MSVC.

Wed Feb 25 22:53:56 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj: Changed the signature of the run(ACE_Time_Value &)
          method to run(const ACE_Time_Value &) so we can pass the const
          ACE_Time_Value::zero to it.  Thanks to Chris Cleeland for
          suggesting this.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.h: Changed the use of ACE_MT_SYNCH
          to ACE_SYNCH so that we can at least build the Event Channel on
          a single-threaded platform.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Service_Constants.h: Changed the use of
          ACE_Thread_Mutex and ACE_RT_Thread_Mutex to ACE_THREAD_MUTEX and
          ACE_RW_THREAD_MUTEX, respectively, so that TAO will build on
          non-threaded platforms.

        * tao/poa.cpp,
          tao/default_server.cpp: Fixed TAO by conditionally
          compiling the code that relies on the recursive mutexes
          and mutexes.  Thanks to Jim Penny <jpenny@universal-fasteners.com>
          for reporting this.

Wed Feb 25 22:47:48 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/README::
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit.idl:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit_i.h: Made changes to have the
        option to specify oneway calls instead of the usual two-way
        cube_X() call.  Now, you can specify the "-o" argument on the
        client side.

Wed Feb 25 22:47:16 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp (parse_args): Similar to
        server.cpp changed the meaning of -s option to not to use the
        naming service and naming service is used by default.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (parse_args): Changed the
        meaning of the -s option to "don't use the naming service" and made
        using the naming service the default.

Wed Feb 25 22:47:16 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp (parse_args): Changed the
        meaning of the -s flag to "don't use the naming service" and made
        using the naming service the default.

Wed Feb 25 18:03:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

Wed Feb 25 17:13:05 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp (Naming_Service):
        Changed the main to just create an instance of Naming_Service and
        call init and run on it.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.h: Added this file which
        defines a Naming_Service class to simplify the Naming_Service.cpp
        file.

Wed Feb 25 16:52:13 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/servant_base.cpp: Updated to reflect change of poa_current_
        from structure to pointer.

        * tao/poa.*: Changed signature of pre_invoke() and post_invoke()
        to deal with poa current storage coming from the stack.

        * tao/poa.cpp (dispatch_servant_i): Changed to create POA Current
        information record on the stack during the upcall, thus clearing
        the way for proper operation in the face of nested upcalls.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Updated to reflect change of poa_current_ from
        structure to pointer.

        * tao/orb_core.*: Changed poa_current_ to a pointer rather than
        ownership.  This allows the structure holding the POA Current
        information to be created in the activation record for the upcall,
        thus opening the door for proper operation in the face of nested
        upcalls.

        * tao/giop.h: Removed cruft/unused code.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Addressed some '@@' comments.

        * tao/connect.*: Fixed a problem where nested upcalls would only
        work every other time.  This was caused by the fact that the
        servant-turned-client cached the connection to the
        client-turned-servant.  However, when the client-turned-servant
        terminated, the servant-turned-client was ignoring input events on
        this cached connection handle.  Then, when the next instance of
        the client-turned-servant came along and tried to connect, when
        the servant-turned-client made the invocation back to the
        client-turned-servant, the cached handle was returned.  However,
        when its input was read, rather than getting the expected
        response, an EOF was received and the servant-turned-client
        aborted the entire original invocation.

        This was fixed by having the TAO_Client_Connection_Handler always
        registered to receive input events and to maintain record of its
        state so that it can tell whether or not it's expecting input.  If
        it receives an unexpected input event, then it will simply close
        down the connection, possibly logging a warning message as well.

Wed Feb 25 16:06:59 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/{client,server}.{h,cpp}: Added callback
        support

Wed Feb 25 16:04:49 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp,h: Added support for making
        upcalls into the application when connection is established,
        requested etc..

Wed Feb 25 12:58:04 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_util.cpp: Added the implementation for the 2 new methods
        to use a child_poa.

        * tao/tao_util.h (class TAO_ORB_Manager): Added 2 new methods
        init_child_poa and activate_under_child_poa to create a child_poa
        with policies PERSISTENT and USER_ID.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.cpp (bind): Added checks for
        null pointers in ACE_DEBUG.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp: Moved this file from
        orbsvcs/Naming_Service/ to this dir.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.h: Moved this file from
        orbsvcs/Naming_Service/ to this directory.

Wed Feb 25 12:20:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/any.cpp (operator<<=): removed declaration of local "tc",
          which shadowed the declaration in the outer scope.

        * tao/giop.cpp (start): added a debug message for connection
          failures.  This is where problems often occur for new users/
          environments, and it'll help diagnose configuration problems.
          And Linux getsockname () bugs.

Tue Feb 24 21:05:08 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Main.cpp: This now contains the main
        which was previously in Naming_Service.cpp to facilitate
        integrating the IOR_Multicast class defined in Naming_Service.cpp
        into the orbsvcs library.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Utils.h: Defines a new
        TAO_Naming_Server wrapper class which can be used as a
        Naming_Server component if one wants a separate Naming_Server.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Utils.cpp: Added this new file
        which implements the TAO_Naming_Server class.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp (read_ior): Added 2 new
        methods read_ior and init_naming_service.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp: Now contains the
        implementation of Cubit_Server class with a really simple main.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.h (class Cubit_Server): Defined
        a new Cubit_Server class akin to Cubit_Client.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp: Moved the main () to
        a separate file Main.cpp

Tue Feb 24 17:45:20 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.h: Removed the unnecessary = 0 on the new run method.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (run): Added a new run() method that takes an
        ACE_Time_Value & rather than an ACE_Time_Value * so that we don't
        need to pass the address!

Tue Feb 24 14:31:37 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.cpp (main): Replaced orb->open() with
        orb->run(&ACE_Time_Value::zero), which though still non-standard,
        is less non-standard than open().

        * tests/NestedUpcall/README: Added one for the good of all
        mankind.

Tue Feb 24 13:23:48 1998 Michael Kircher   <mk1@cec.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/NavWeap.idl: Added new fields

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.cpp:
        adopted to new IDL file

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Sim_Display/Display_Push_Consumer.java:
        adopted to new IDL file


Tue Feb 24 00:41:48 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp: Added TITLE,
          DESCRIPTION for all the classes

Mon Feb 23 22:40:22 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/cdr.h: removed old, commented out configuration code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (tc_name2long): changed type of "buf" array
          from char to long so that it gets properly aligned.  This solves
          the core dump problem with tao_idl on egcs/Solaris.  Thanks to
          Hkan Kllberg <hk@simulina.se> for reporting this.

        * TAO/tests/Thruput/TAO/utils.cpp (prep_timer): cast LONG_MAX
          to ACE_INT32 to avoid overflow problems if the result is an
          int type, and long is bigger than int.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.i: specify constant
          2147483648u as unsigned, to avoid compiler warning.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: removed -fPIC for g++ because it's not needed
          without shared libraries.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: added Cleanup section, which cleans out builds
          that were created with the nested version of the Makefile.

Mon Feb 23 22:13:14 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.5, released Mon Feb 23 22:13:14 1998.

Mon Feb 23 21:30:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: added the g++ options that were picked up
          from be/Makefile.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp (start_servants):
          declare local "i" outside of for loop because it is reused
          in a few loops.

Mon Feb 23 20:45:03 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cec.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Sim_Display: Fixed some small
        bugs concerning the representation

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.cpp:
        Changed the rate on which events are supplied


Mon Feb 23 18:51:03 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp (main): Set the handle
        limit to the maximum.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp (initialize_orb): Fixed a
        warning from compiler.

Mon Feb 23 17:33:52 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile:
          We don't generate the compiler as a single executable, without
          multiple shared libraries.

Mon Feb 23 16:55:08 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Service_Constants.h: changed types of
          ACE_ES_* constants from u_long to long to match
          RtecEventComm::EventType.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.cpp: updated template
          instantiations to use ACE_Singleton instead of ACE_TSS.

Mon Feb 23 12:25:21 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.cpp:
          We cannot use TSS memory pools: in some cases the memory is
          allocated in one thread and disposed in another. Until we can
          clean out that behavior I'm using a singleton.

Mon Feb 23 11:57:16 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/ : Changed the names EXT_ID and INT_ID
        that I used for Hash_Table operations to less generic
        CosProperty_Hash_Key and CosProperty_Hash_Value respectively.

Mon Feb 23 11:40:37 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.h (CORBA::LongLong): use ACE_BIG_ENDIAN
          instead of TAO_WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

        * tao/orbconf.h (TAO_ENCAP_BYTE_ORDER): use ACE_LITTLE_ENDIAN
          instead of trying to figure it out from cpp #defines, which
          failed for LynxOS.  Also, removed TAO_WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

        * tao/interp.cpp (declare_entry,setup_entry): use the align_struct_
          with padding by default, unless TAO_HAS_FIXED_BYTE_ALIGNMENT is
          #defined.

        * tao/corba.h: added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (VAR); to TAO_CATCH macro
          for platforms without ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS, to avoid compiler
          warning about unused variable if VAR isn't used anywhere.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: added clean and realclean targets for
          CROSS-COMPILE platforms.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (be_interface::relative_name):
          commented out unused local variable "def_scope".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp: commented out some unused variables
          to avoid compiler warnings.  The comments correspond to commented-out
          sections of code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp
          (be_visitor_collocated_ss::visit_operation): removed unused
          local "nl".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root.cpp (be_visitor_root_ch::visit_sequence):
          added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (node).

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp
          (be_visitor_sequence_ch::visit_sequence): commented out unused
          local "cg".

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp
          (Latency_Supplier::push): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (_env).

Mon Feb 23 10:58:42 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/SchedEntry.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Strategy_Scheduler.h:
        * Added more TAO_ORBSVCS_Export macros, this time in files that
          are not compiled all the time.

Sun Feb 22 22:14:08 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp (invoke): Created my own temporary variable in
        order to de-warn on g++ and Sun CC.

Sun Feb 22 20:12:24 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Adapted chages to the directory
          rearrangement.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Runtime_Scheduler.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/BCU.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Entries.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Config_Scheduler.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Scheduler.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Scheduler_Generic.h: Added
          TAO_ORBSVCS_Export flags.

Sat Feb 21 08:08:55 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: added -Wno-used to CCFLAGS, with g++ only.

        * tao/align.h,corbacom.h,orbconf.h,orbobj.cpp:
          use ACE Basic_Types instead of local SIZEOF_* macros.

        * tao/debug.cpp: null f{,un}lockfile with ACE_HAS_DCE_DRAFT4_THREADS
          (LynxOS).

        * tao/any.cpp (operator<<=): initialized local "tc" to avoid compiler
          warnings.

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/Servant_Activator.cpp (etherealize),
          Servant_Locator.cpp (preinvoke,postinvoke):
          added some ACE_UNUSED_ARG's.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile,tao/Makefile: use CROSS-COMPILE flag instead of
          CHORUS, LYNXOS, and VXWORKS.  This allows us to add new cross-
          compile platforms without having to modify the TAO Makefiles.
          The new platform need only set the CROSS-COMPILE flag.

Sat Feb 21 00:31:20 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/connect.* (send_request): Modified to take an extra arg
        which specifies whether or not the request is a twoway, i.e.,
        whether or not it should enter a sub-event loop looking for a
        reply.

        * tao/giop.cpp (invoke): Changed to match signature of
        send_request.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/Reactor.idl: Added a oneway method to test
        nested upcalls with oneways.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/reactor_i.*: Added the oneway implementation.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/client.cpp: Made oneway invocation to test a
        problem that the nested upcall allowing ORB exhibited.  Thanks to
        Carlos for reporting this!

Fri Feb 20 14:40:28 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/connect.*: Extended TAO_Client_Connection_Handler to be run
        a sub-event loop while sending a request in order to handle nested
        upcalls.  A really cool side-effect of this is that if your
        application start out being a client but has servants too, it's
        really easy to get that up and running.  An example of this is
        shown in the new test, NestedUpcall.

        * tao/giop.cpp (invoke): Changed to call send_request on the
        client connection handler rather than TAO_GIOP.  This new
        send_request will handle nested upcalls (see above).

        * tao/giop.* (send_request): Changed signature so that the
        TAO_SVC_HANDLER* wasn't passed by reference.  This was totally
        unnecessary.

        * tao/{iioporb,orbobj}.* (string_to_object): Removed unnecessary
        'const' preceding CORBA::String.

Fri Feb 20 08:29:35 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp (svc): added .in ()
          dereference to several objref uses.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Memory_Pools.cpp: updated the
          ACE_TSS <ACE_Malloc<...> > template instantiation to use the
          ACE_LOCAL_MEMORY_POOL macro.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.{h,cpp}
          (ACE_ES_{Con,Dis}junction_Group): added virtual destructors.

Thu Feb 19 12:54:50 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp
        (create_initial_propertysetdef):  Assigned dummy return values in
        order to avoid Warnings.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosProeprtyService.idl file removed
        from here. It is supposed to be there in ./..

Thu Feb 19 12:49:49 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: build orbsvcs before tests.

        * tao/Makefile: set fakesvcconf on LynxOS.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: don't build the IDL compiler for
          Chorus, LynxOS, or VxWorks.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: enhanced some printouts.

        * tao/tao_util.cpp (orb): added .in () dereference to orb_ argument.

Thu Feb 19 10:15:00 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>
        * orbsvcs/test/Simulator: Set the file permissions right.

Thu Feb 19 10:15:00 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>
        * orbsvcs/test/Simulator:
          Intruduced new demo, using the Event Service as transport
          media for monitoring events.
          See orbsvcs/test/Simulator/README for more information

Wed Feb 18 22:15:06 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_util.cpp,h: Updated class to include a constructor so
        user can supply his own orb, poa or manager.

Wed Feb 18 21:40:24 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * docs/orbsvcs.html:
          Updated the description of orbsvcs directory hierarchy.

Wed Feb 18 19:45:57 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added the idl file for the CosPropertyService , i.e.
        orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService.idl

Wed Feb 18 17:56:54 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs:
          Moved all the implementations to the orbsvcs libraries, this is
          the first step to give the user control over object
          collocation.
          Please note that this version is only known to compile on
          Solaris/CC, it will *not* compile on NT (some "export" macros
          are missing); since this change is very disruptive (because it
          moves files around) it was thought that holding it for a long
          time will result in more harm than good.
          A top-level make on $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs works OK.

Wed Feb 18 17:10:23 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_util.cpp (init): The ORB_Manager class does not create
        it's own POA, but uses the default root POA instead.

Wed Feb 18 16:02:34 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Commented and indented the follwing files in orbsvcs/orbsvcs/
          CosPropertyService.idl
          CosPropertyService_i.h
          CosPropertyService_i.cpp

Wed Feb 18 12:28:58 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput/TAO/tmplinst.cpp:
          The templates should be instantiated over the CORBA:: typedefs,
          otherwise they fail in weird platforms.

Wed Feb 18 11:57:24 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile (LDLIBS): Removed -lposix4
        from the LDLIBS.  Thanks to Bob Olson <olson@mcs.anl.gov> for
        reporting this.

Wed Feb 18 02:58:40 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp (IOR_Multicast): Make
          sure that response_addr_ is properly initialized before it is
          used to initialize response_, which is an ACE_SOCK_Dgram.

Tue Feb 17 20:20:35 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp: Removed an extra explicit template instantiation
          of TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<TAO_GIOP_ServiceContext>.  Thanks to
          Ben Eng <ben@jetpen.com> for reporting this!

        * tests/Thruput/TAO/Makefile: Removed the "clean" macro since it
          was conflicting with the TAO default.

Tue Feb 17 21:47:41 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp (shutdown): Renamed please_exit
        method to shutdown.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl: Renamed please_exit operation to
        shutdown.

Tue Feb 17 17:22:47 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.4, released Tue Feb 17 17:22:47 1998.

Tue Feb 17 16:50:20 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (open): Modified so that if it's been called
        multiple times it returns '1' rather than '-1', thus not appearing
        to calling code as an error.

Tue Feb 17 16:05:55 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Chris G. updated the file list of
          this project.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Utilities.h: Added MS keayword,
          TAO_ORBSVCS_Export.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.dsp: Updated project setting to
          take the advantage of TAO naming service.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.dsp: Updated project
          setting to use DLL version of orbsvcs.

Tue Feb 17 15:39:49 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h::
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit.idl:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/cubit_i.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.h: Made a bunch of changes to
        correctly support the POA.  In addition, MT_Cubit now uses the
        Name Service to bind the Cubit objects.  In case the Name Service
        doesn't exist, there is still the "cut&paste" ior method that uses
        a cubit factory to give the client a reference to the cubit
        objects.

Tue Feb 17 13:25:52 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO-INSTALL.html: Added instructions on using the CPP_LOCATION
          environment variable in NT's section.  You can also use it on
          UNIX but NT is the only platform which depends on it.

Tue Feb 17 11:30:53 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: set TAO_ALIGNMENT_MAGIC_NUMBER to 128 if
          ACE_SIZEOF_LONG > 4, e.g., on 64-bit CPUs.

        * tao/except.cpp (make_standard_typecode): replaced unsigned long/
          long with CORBA::ULong/CORBA::Long.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_array.cpp,ast_operation.cpp,ast_sequence.cpp,
          ast_string.cpp,
          TAO_IDL/util/utl_decllist.cpp,utl_exceptlist.cpp,utl_exprlist.cpp,
          utl_idlist.cpp,utl_labellist.cpp,utl_namelist.cpp,utl_strlist.cpp:
          moved base class initialization to beginning of initializer list.

Tue Feb 17 10:43:45 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTimeBase.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.i:
          Added the standard CORBA types for time, also added some helper
          routines to convert between BasicTime::TimeT and the common
          representations of time in ACE (ACE_Time_Value and ACE_hrtime_t)

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecEventComm.idl:

Tue Feb 17 07:40:49 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/any.cpp: Added a "return *this" to operator= to stop certain
          compilers from complaining.  Thanks to Andy for fixing this.

Tue Feb 17 04:08:11 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_cpp_init): Setting the
          CPP_PATH has been causing a lot of nasty trouble on NT.  I
          changed this function to allow overwriting the internal c++
          compiler location at run time using $CPP_LOCATION.  If someone
          forgets to set the CPP_PATH when compiling tao_idl, one can
          make tao_idl work by defining this environment variable to
          something like:

             set CPP_LOCATION="C:/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/BIN/CL.exe"

          Notice that CPP_LOCATION _must_ be a full pathname of the c++
          compiler.

Tue Feb 17 00:56:08 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/main.cpp (main): Added some
        more testing for Any in and out of Hash Table.

        * TAO version 0.1.3, released Mon Feb 16 18:01:23 1998.

Mon Feb 16 18:00:15 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * release.pl: Changed C++ comment leaders to Perl comment leaders.

Mon Feb 16 17:51:15 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp : Added -s option to use the
        NamingService. Default doesn't use NamingService.

Mon Feb 16 17:38:15 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iioporb.cpp: Made sure to count separators when allocating
        space for the IOR.  This corrected ABW errors in purify.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Explicitly set the buffer when being purified
        to avoid complaints.

Mon Feb 16 17:22:15 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: Changed LDFLAGS to link orbsvcs
        library.Now uses the Naming service.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp: Added code to register
        IDL_Cubit/cubit_factory name with the naming service.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Added a -s flag to use the
        NamingService to resolve the cubit_factory flag. It still has the
        commandline IOR and -f ior_file options.

Mon Feb 16 13:29:31 1998  Brian Mendel <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/poa.cpp: Added SCE_HAS_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS_CHAR guards
           around ACE_OS:strlen calls for WChar(s).
        * tao/default.bld, tao.bld: Update VxWorks GHS Build files.

Mon Feb 16 12:24:04 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        variable.  Things now compile.

Mon Feb 16 10:18:25 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp (decode_string_to_sequence): moved declaration of
          local "i" outside of loop because it is used after the loop.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/RT_Task.cpp (synch_threads): try two
          fallback strategies if the task activiation fails:
          ACE_SCHED_OTHER scheduling class with requested priority, then
          ACE_SCHED_OTHER scheduling class with minimum thread priority.
          Thanks to Bob Olson <olson@mcs.anl.gov> for reporting the
          problem in Irix, which doesn't have a thread priority of 0
          with ACE_SCHED_OTHER.

        * tao/corbacom.h (CORBA_SEQUENCE): replaced CORBA::B_FALSE with 0
          because some compilers, such as egcs, can't handle its use before
          definition below in class CORBA.  Thanks to Todd Pack
          <todd@rwii.com> for reporting this.

        * tao/giop.cpp (TAO_GIOP_message_name): cast quotient of sizeof's
          to int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

        * tao/interp.cpp (calc_nested_size_and_alignment,private_size,
          private_alignment): qualified TC_KIND_COUNT with CORBA::,
          so that the file-scope TC_KIND_COUNT isn't used in the
          comparison.

Mon Feb 16 10:14:34 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp:
          The _free method was emitted in the .i file, but it was not
          declared inline. Thanks to Michael Kircher (mk1@cs.wustl.edu)
          for reporting this one.

Mon Feb 16 02:34:24 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosPropertyService_i.cpp: Defined some of the
        functions for the TAO_PropertySet class.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosPropertyService_i.h: Defined the  classes for
        implementing the CosPropertyService for TAO.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/Makefile:  Added this
        Makefile ( Makefile for making test program for the
        PropertyService )

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosProperty_Hash.cpp:  Added this file.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosProperty_Hash.h (Table): Added this
        file. This contains  the classes for maintaining Hash Table for
        storing the PropertySets.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/main.cpp (main): Added this
        test file for CosPropertyService


Sun Feb 15 20:12:00 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.{h,cpp}: Heavily modified several routines to correct
        problems with the notion of what, exactly, an object key really
        is.  Some were treating it as simply an octet sequence, others as
        a zero-terminated string (C-style), while others as a sequence of
        octets which must be terminated by a zero.

        Object keys and IDs are now stored canonically as opaque octet
        sequences, and two new conversion routines
        (encode_sequence_to_string and decode_string_to_sequence) have
        been created to convert between these octet sequences and C-style
        strings.

        * tao/iioporb.cpp (object_to_string): Modified to utilize the new
        encoding routines to convert from octet sequences to printable
        strings.

        * tao/{tao_internals,orbobj}.cpp: Added explicit inclusion of
        Object_Manager.h.

Sun Feb 15 16:15:49 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/options.cpp (parse_args): Changed the -f option
        to read the servant-IOR from a file.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Changed the -f
        <cubit_factory_key> to -f <cubit_factory_ior_file>. Reads the ior
        from that file.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp : Added -o <ior_output_file>
        option to output the cubit factory ior to a file.

Sat Feb 14 22:39:46 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp (init): Added negative test case
        of name not found when calling the naming service' resolve()
        method.

Fri Feb 13 19:37:01 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Changed char buf[BUFSIZ]
          to char buf[ACE_MAX_DGRAM_SIZE] to make sure we don't overflow
          the buffer!

Fri Feb 13 12:56:01 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * release.pl: fixed typo, missing comma between chmod args.

          because they're no longer used.

        * tao/encode.cpp,poa.{h,cpp},poaC.{h,cpp}: replaced wchar_t
          with CORBA::WChar.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_generator.cpp,TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp
          (create_wstring): use short instead of wchar_t if
          ACE_HAS_WCHAR_TYPEDEFS_CHAR.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp (tao_name): changed type of loop index
          "i" to unsigned int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_exception.cpp,be_state_structure.cpp (gen_code):
          added default case to switch statement, which sets "os" to 0, to
          avoid compiler warning about possible unitialized use.

        * tests/POA/Default_Servant/File_i.cpp (lseek): changed type
          of "result" to CORBA::Long to avoid signed/unsigned comparison
          with -1.  Cast it to CORBA::ULong on return.  Also, added a

          unsigned comparison.  Also, added a bunch of ACE_UNUSED_ARG (env)'s.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp (EC_Proxy::push,
          Test_ECP::push): changed type of loop index "i" to u_int to
          avoid signed/unsigned comparison.  Also, added an
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG (env).

Wed Feb 11 11:20:34 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.h,stub.h (operator =): added return type to avoid
          compiler warning, and wrapped in ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC.

        * tao/corbacom.h: rearranged LongLong typedefs so that they work
          with ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T.

        * tao/Timeprobe.cpp (print_times): divide by 1000u instead of 1000
          to allow overload resolution of ACE_U_LongLong::operator /.

          warnings.

        * tao/typecode.cpp: wrapped some break and return statements with

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: added default_vxworks target to prevent make
          warning.

          including:
          + The name for the array TypeCode and its alias TypeCode were
            clashing.
          + Several inconsistencies in the declaration and definition of

Wed Feb  4 12:30:43 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/objkeyC.h: Modified so that the namespace mapping for the
        TAO module uses the alternative "underbar" mapping, i.e., rather
        than TAO::ObjectKey, it's now TAO_ObjectKey.  The scoping
        operation is now performed in tao.h.

        * tao/tao.h: This now contains a class (used as a namespace) in

          Removed a broken test target; thanks to Michael Kircher
          <mk1@cec.wustl.edu>

        invocation style (sii vs. dii) using a shaell variable.

        * docs/releasenotes/{index,orbcore}.html: Updated to include some
        details regarding this release.  These files are behind the
        release, but I'm opting to get the release out and update these
        files ex post facto.

        * release.pl: Updated this script so that it can update different
        levels of the release version number based on the setting of the
        RELEASE_TYPE environment variable.

        * Makefile: Added release.chk to the list of files going into the
        release.  This file is our checklist for things that have been
        tested and work leading up to a release.  Check in here for
        details on how a test has worked on a platform.

        * tests/POA/FindPOA/FindPOA.cpp (main): Added missing double-quote
        in ACE_DEBUG().

Thu Jan 29 15:55:25 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp:
          We need to keep a reference to the ORB is some place.

Thu Jan 29 14:59:01 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/server.cpp:
        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant/MyFooServant.cpp:
        * tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp:
        * tests/POA/Default_Servant/server.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
        _var's passed as pointers need to use the .in() method.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test: Added a longer delay, changed port #,
        and made all output be prefaced by either "SERVER: " or
        "CLIENT(<type>): ".

        * tao/poa.cpp: Re-ordered member initializers to de-warn g++.

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.cpp: _narrow needs to be
        passed a .in() from _vars (you get a lollipop if you understand
        that comment).

        * docs/poa_migration.html: Added this file to start the ball
        rolling.  Right now it's poorly-formatted and a rehash of some
        emails, but it will be refined and grow over time.

Thu Jan 29 12:33:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/clnt.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/clnt.h:
          Simple Naming simply tries to locate the Naming Service, it is
          useful to test the TAO facilities (multicast, environment,
          command line) for that purpose.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.h:
          We do not attempt to use nested context unless requested by the
          user, the reason is that it is failing consistently right now.

Thu Jan 29 10:34:08 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp: Some bug fixes made in the pre-POA
        TAO version were accidentally overwritten during the POA to main
        branch merge. This has been fixed.

        * tao/{encode, decode}.cpp: Fixed the terrible alignment problems
        that we were having on VxWorks for marshaling structures. At this
        time, the fix has been made only to "structs". These problems were
        being caused because the C++ compiler on NT/VxWorks was laying out
        structures on a 4 byte aligned address. If a "double" is the very
        first field, it will allocate the double at the 4 byte aligned
        address even if a double is 8 byte aligned. The fix is to make
        sure that when we align, we must take into account the start
        address of the structure as well as the address at which the field
        is laid out.

Thu Jan 29 10:29:14 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile:
          Compile <tests> before <orbsvcs>, if the first one fails the
          second will sure fail also.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile:
          Updated comments and reformated some unreadable things.

Wed Jan 28 15:35:37 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/Makefile:
          Fixed Makefiles so we can invoke the top level Makefile safely.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test: Updated to utilized the new '-o'
        option on the server side and for the clients to get the IOR from
        that file.

        * tests/Param_Test/server.cpp: Added '-o' option to specify the
        name of a file in which the server can deposit the IOR which the
        client should use.

        * tests/Param_Test/options.cpp: Updated the options string (forgot
        it last time through).

Wed Jan 28 13:35:11 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/server.cpp: Changed so that the IOR is printed
        ALL the time.

        * tests/Param_Test/options.*: Updated to work with POA.  Got rid
        of host and port arguments and added an IOR argument.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h: Added emacs mode setting at
        beginning.

Wed Jan 28 13:19:55 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/README:
          Update README on how to run the test.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp:
          Print the IOR always, it is neded to run properly.


        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/tmplinst.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/tmplinst.cpp:
          Instantiate on CORBA::Long instead of a plain long.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/svr.cpp:
          Cosmetic changes on debug messages.

Wed Jan 28 11:20:38 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Logger.idl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/logger.idl:
          Moved a prototype logger.idl to the orbsvcs library, eventually
          this will become a full blown service in the TAO architecture.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/logger_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/logger_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/svr.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduling_Service.cpp:
          Fixed minor problem with call using a _var as input parameter

Wed Jan 28 09:14:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Makefile:
          Fixed order in the DIRS variable, Generic_Servant goes first
          since it builds a library needed in some of the other tests.

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/Makefile:
        * tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/Makefile:
          Fixed order for libraries, -lserver uses -lTAO so it must go
          first.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Another case of misplaced includes.


Tue Jan 27 17:29:11 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile:

Tue Jan 27 16:16:11 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/server.cpp: Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG() inside the
        TAO_CATCH() macro scope to de-warn on g++.

        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.cpp (Param_Test_i::CTOR): Removed
        argument name to de-warn on g++.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/{svr,clnt}.cpp: Use in() method on
        _var class to explicitly get an _ptr.

        * tao/objtable.cpp (find): Changed conditional expression to not
        rely on implicit conversion from _var to _ptr type.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Updated "illegal message" error message to
        actually print out the type of the offending message.  This also
        caused the addition of a helper function--TAO_GIOP_message_name().

Tue Jan 27 15:06:28 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile:
        * TAO_IDL/be/Makefile:

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/Makefile:
        * tests/POA/RootPOA/Makefile:
        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies, apparently they were not properly
          generated last time; they worked for Solaris/CC, but not in many
          other platforms.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/tmplinst.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/TAO_IDL_templates.cpp:
          It seems that tmplinst.cpp is becoming our standard for template
          instantiation files.

        * tao/poa.h:
          No need to include poa_T.h, it is not used in any place (yet),
          and it produces many warnings on IRIX machines.

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.cpp:
          Use a _var for the output sequence of RT_Infos.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          Fixed some misuses of _var, thanks to Chris Cleeland for
          bringing those to my attention.

        * release.pl:
          Added CVS id.

        * tests/POA/Generic_Servant: Added comments to all files

Mon Jan 26 21:29:24 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: don't #define NOERROR on DIGITAL_UNIX,
          or on any other platform that already has it #defined.
          Thanks to Oliver Kellogg <Oliver.Kellogg@vs.dasa.de> for
          reporting this.

        * tao/corbacom.h: use ACE_INT32, etc., for defining Long, etc.

Mon Jan 26 16:15:18 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp (read_buffer): Modified this to detect ECONNRESET
        and report is as a normal EOF occurrence.  This will hopefully
        eliminate a disturbing (but innocuous) message on NT.  Thanks to
        Frank H. at SAIC for reporting this.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test: Added this script to run the server
        and client with all arguments.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.h:
          It compiles now, but it won't run.

Mon Jan 26 15:29:37 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/ (main):
        Added simple client/server to test AVStreams

Mon Jan 26 15:23:54 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AVStreams_i.cpp:

Mon Jan 26 00:57:56 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/connect.cpp (open): Conditionally compile the code for
          TCP_NODELAY only if this macro is present.  Thanks to Edgar
          Villanueva <edgarvil@ix.netcom.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 25 14:30:04 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.dsp: Added a missing source.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (Cubit_Client): Changed to
          initialize Cubit_Client.cubit_key_ from heap.  It should use
          memory either from stack or heap, but never both.

Sat Jan 24 21:55:55 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/{AVStreams_i.h, AVStreams_i.cpp}:
          Made changes for new POA

Sat Jan 24 21:46:23 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AVStreams.idl:
        Changed type key to be a string, rather than a sequence<octet>, which
        breaks tao_idl!

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp:
        * tao/TAO.dsp:
          CVS does not merge binary files properly.

Sat Jan 24 15:51:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/objtable.cpp:
          Another merge problem.

Sat Jan 24 11:20:42 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added latest changes by Irfan.

        Sat Jan 24 03:04:51 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp (id_to_reference): Reimplemented this method so that
          it does not use id_to_servant and servant_to_reference combo.
          This is necessary since id_to_reference may be used in a
          MULTI_ID mode.

        * tao/poaS: Added explicit copy and destroy to all collocated
          policies.  This will help avoid the inheritance via dominance
          warnings.

Sat Jan 24 11:08:28 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor.h:
          The forward declaration of TAO_OutStream was missing; I guess it
          was some slopiness in the merge.

Sat Jan 24 10:30:40 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * The POA branch is merged back into the main trunk. For the
          record we reproduce the ChangeLog in the branch.

        * ============
        * ============ Start of POA branch changes.

        Fri Jan 23 17:08:45 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Channel.i:
          Fixed problem with Event Channel, it was using _this
          unproperly.

        Fri Jan 23 16:49:19 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/{server.cpp,param_test_i.h,param_test_i.cpp}:
        Updated to compile with new POA.

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile: Moved LDFLAGS up, included the
        rules.tao.GNU, and removed the dependencies which were causing me
        no end of grief.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp (main): Changed the check on
        return value from resolve_initial_references() to use the
        CORBA::is_nil() check.

        Fri Jan 23 16:43:12 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.h:
          "Ported" the orbsvcs and the Event_Latency test to POA, with
          little success though, things will compile and it seems that the
          Naming_Service and Scheduling_Services run properly, but
          Event_Service does not.
          We use a nested POA with "PERSISTENT" lifespan policy because it
          is easier to set an enviroment variable or command line to the
          NameService IOR.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp:
          Removed some extra (and unwanted) code.

        Fri Jan 23 14:47:18 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/{FindPOA,RootPOA,NewPOA}/Makefile: Added
        -L$(TAO_ROOT)/tao to LDFLAGS.

        * tests/POA/NewPOA/NewPOA.cpp:
        * tests/POA/RootPOA/RootPOA.cpp:
        * tests/POA/FindPOA/FindPOA.cpp:
        Used the ::in() method as first argument to _narrow() calls.

        * tests/{Makefile,README}: Updated for new tests.

        * tao/poa.cpp: Added explicit template instantiations.

        Fri Jan 23 14:30:19 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.h:
        * tao/poa.cpp:
        * tao/servant_base.cpp:
          _this() was using the object id for the current servant in *all*
          objects, now it only does so for the servant invoked.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp:
          Ported the Cubit test to POA, including some funky persistent
          policies to simplify its use.

        Sat Jan 24 01:24:24 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp (destroy_i): Changed etherealize objects to correct
          report remaining_activations.

        Fri Jan 23 10:55:40 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/objtable.cpp:
          Linear object tables were not using the initial size to
          pre-allocate a buffer.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp:
          Fixed the mapping for native as OUT or INOUT parameters, also
          fixed the name for the _dispatch() method.

        Fri Jan 23 01:12:28 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poaS.cpp: Added ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro to constructors.

        Thu Jan 22 23:57:31 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp (wstring_to_ObjectId): Stuck the CORBA::WChar type
        in parens for sizeof...g++ likes it better that way.

        Fri Jan 23 00:14:03 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa:

          - Added support for transient and persistent POAs by changing
            the ObjectKey.  From now on, each key will contain an
            identifier that will indicate whether the key came from a
            persistent or transient POA.  That way the dispatch method can
            decide the value of the activate_it flag while finding the
            POA.  If the key is from a persistent POA, the activate_it
            flag will be true, else the flag will be set to false.

          - All operations on the parent POA will check for a valid parent
            before executing the call.  Remember that the RootPOA does not
            have a parent POA.

          - Temporarily added export macros to the POA implementation
            classes, so that the implementations can directly be debugged
            (rather than going through the stubs/skeletons).  These should
            be removed once the debugging process is over.

          - Moved the registeration of the POA with its manager from the
            create_POA method to the POA constructor.  This is to insure
            that the registration of the RootPOA is not "missed" since the
            RootPOA is not created via the create_POA call.  Similarly,
            moved the removal of the POA from its manager from the destroy
            method to the POA destructor.

          - TAO_POA::delete_child and TAO_POA_Manager::remove_poa were
            changed such that when the object is closing down, we are
            currently iterating over our poa collection and there is not
            need to remove the item from our collection.

          - Changed use of substr from starting_at/ending_at to
            starting_at/now_many.

          - Methods that return duplicated values/objects, must first be
            assigned to a _var variable before being used.  This will
            avoid memory leaks.

          - For find methods, always use != -1 for success.

          - Added code to create_POA_i and find_POA_i_optimized to check
            when topmost_poa_name == this->name_.

          - Added the concept of creation time to a POA.  This way when a
            transient POA gets a object key from a previous incarnation,
            the OBJECT_NOT_EXISTS exception can be thrown.

          - Added a locator cookie field to TAO_POA_Current to keep track
            of the cookie produced by the servant locator.

          - Made all methods virtual.

          - Renamed active_object_table to active_object_map.

          - Added pre_invoke and post_invoke methods to setup the
            necessary state before doing the upcall to the servant.

          - Changed locate_servant to return 0 for success and -1 for
            failure instead of trying to return a servant.  This change is
            necessary since there may not be a servant available but there
            may be default servants or servant managers that could fill in
            for the servant.  Currently the locate_servant method takes an
            optimistic approach to return TRUE when the servant was not
            found but a default servant or servant manager was registered
            with the POA, hoping the default servant or servant manager
            will be able to fill in when the real request arrives.

          - Add a validity checks for POA policies.

          - Added support for servant managers (both servant locators and
            servant activators), default servants and DSI.

        * tao/poaC.h: Added DynamicImplementation class to the
          PortableServer.

        * tao/poaS: Changed dispatch to _dispatch.

        * tao/servant_base:

          - Added TAO_DynamicImplementation class
            (a.k.a. PortableServer::DynamicImplementation).  Users will
            inherit from this to implement DSI.

          - Added prefix _ to all methods names in the ServantBase class
            to avoid potential crashes with user specified method names.

          - Made TAO_POA a friend of ServantBase.

        * tao/connect.cpp (handle_locate): Changed to use latest version
          of TAO_POA::locate_servant.

        * tao/servant_base.cpp (_default_POA): Changed to use
          TAO_ORB_Core_instance()->root_poa() instead of
          TAO_ORB_Core_instance()->orb()->resolve_initial_references("RootPOA").

        * tao/poaC: Added string_to_ObjectId and ObjectId_to_string
          methods to PortableServer.

        * tao/poa.cpp (TAO_Adapter_Activator::unknown_adapter): Changed
          the implementation of this object so that it does not depend on
          being friends with the POA and the POAManager.  Initially, this
          was done to avoid recursive locks.  However, since user may want
          to write their own implementations, recursive locks were deemed
          necessary.

        * tao/default_server.cpp (create_poa_lock): Changed implementation
          to produce ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex instead of
          ACE_Thread_Mutex.

        * tests/POA/RootPOA/RootPOA.cpp (main) and
          tests/POA/NewPOA/NewPOA.cpp (main): Added code to destroy the
          rootPOA.  I am not sure this is the responsibility of the user
          to destroy the rootPOA since they never really created it.  The
          responsibility probably lies with the ORB, but since the spec
          seems neutral about this, it is ok for now.

        * tao/object.i (CORBA_Object::Release): We must delete the object
          when the parent_ refcount goes to zero.

        Thu Jan 22 16:56:32 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
          Fixed some relative name problems for the server header file.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_args.cpp:
          Get rid of some "unused arg" warnings.

        Thu Jan 22 15:26:55 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/object.i: CORBA::Object --> CORBA_Object for internal stuff.

        * tao/object.i (CORBA_Object): Re-ordered member initialization to
        match declaration order.

        Thu Jan 22 14:40:01 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.h:
          Fixed multiple definitions of ORB_var and ORB_out due to a
          simplistic merge.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          Generate _find() to locate operations; using just find() is not
          complaint.

        Thu Jan 22 10:40:13 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged changes from main_to_poa_merge_10 up to
          main_to_poa_merge_11

        Wed Jan 21 17:35:20 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
          Generate CORBA_Object instead of CORBA::Object to keep NT
          happy.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_args.cpp:
          Fixed mapping for strings as arguments, they should always be
          char*.

        Mon Jan 19 22:03:38 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/sequence_T.i:
          Object_Manager constructor was calling _duplicate(). That is not
          the right semantics, and produces a crash when working on an
          unitialized buffer.

        * tests/POA/NewPOA/NewPOA.cpp:
        * tests/POA/NewPOA/NewPOA.dsp:
          Fixed signed/unsigned warning.

        * tests/POA/NewPOA/NewPOA.dsp:
          Fixed missing options to find ACE.

        Mon Jan 19 16:36:22 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.h:
        * tao/iiopobj.cpp:
          Added a missed in action key() method to IIOP_Object.

        * tao/stub.h:
        * tao/objkeyC.h:
        * tao/object.h:
        * tao/object.cpp:
          Removed the non-complaint ObjectKey_ptr type.

        Mon Jan 19 16:19:28 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
          A reinterpret cast was dropping constness also, thanks to Irfan
          for pointing this one out.

        Mon Jan 19 15:36:10 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T.i:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          The last merge was too smart, it kept some changes on this
          branch that should have gone away.

        Mon Jan 19 13:58:01 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          Fixed operation table initialization, also called proper
          constructor for CORBA::Object in collocated classes.

        * tao/corba.h:
          More include reordering.

        * tao/servant_base.h:
          The operation table was not properly initialized.

        Mon Jan 19 11:28:47 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged changes from main_to_poa_merge_9 up to
        main_to_poa_merge_10.

        Sun Jan 18 01:04:22 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h:
        * tao/servant_base.h:
          Added support for collocation in the _narrow method, this
          required a complete implementation of _downcast() for each
          skeleton.

        Sat Jan 17 20:54:26 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
          More bug fixes in code generation for sequences, attributes,
          etc. Most of them were minor inconsitencies. Also fixed
          constructors for collocated classes on NT (working around MSVC++
          bug).

        * tao/servant_base.cpp:
        * tao/servant_base.h:
          Added default implementation for _downcast(), it just works if
          downcasting to "Object".

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
          Fixed some problems with managed sequences.

        Sat Jan 17 19:27:12 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/servant_base.h:
        * tao/servant_base.cpp:
          Added the new _is_a() method on TAO_ServantBase.

          Added a new _is_a to the generated servants, also implemented
          the _is_a method on the collocated classes by invoking that
          _is_a().
          Added support for attributes in collocated classes, thanks to
          Irfan for noticing this.

        Sat Jan 17 15:44:43 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * Merged changes from main_to_poa_merge_8 to main_to_poa_merge_9.

        Sat Jan 17 00:45:59 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA: Added new tests: Explicit_Activation_POA_Ids and
          NewPOA.

        * tao/servant_base.h (TAO_ServantBase): Added a _downcast method
          that gets the servant with the correct vtable.  Also added a new
          class TAO_Local_ServantBase that overwrites _create_stub.
          TAO_Local_ServantBase::_create_stub uses a fake key and does not
          registration with the default POA.

        * tao/poaS.*: Added _downcast to the generated code. Also added
          attribute accessor methods.  Also updated constructors to
          explicitly initialize the virtual base class (CORBA::Object).

        * tao/poaC.h: Added TAO_Local_ServantBase to the PortableServer
          namespace as PortableServer::LocalServantBase.

        * tao/poaC.cpp (_narrow): Changed the implementation of _narrow to
          produce a collocated class when appropriate.

        * tao/poa.cpp (TAO_POA::create_*_policy): Made sure these methods
          return collocated classes and not implementation classes.

        * tao/poa.h (class TAO_POA_Policies): Added set methods to
          TAO_POA_Policies.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_poa): Made sure that the RootPOA is
          created with the PortableServer::IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION policy.

        * tao/object: Added servant pointer and a collocated flag to
          object class.

        Fri Jan 16 03:27:30 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao:

            BOA begone: CORBA::POA and all BOA related code has been
            removed from TAO.

            POA: Today the PortableServer and the POA were born in TAO.

        * tao/connect (handle_request): Changed handle_request to accept
          the TAO_GIOP_RequestHeader parameter by reference rather than by
          value.

        * tao/corba.h: Rearranged header to accommodate the new POA.

        * tao/corbacom.h (CORBA): Added typedefs for Object_var Object_out
          in the CORBA class.

        * tao/current: Absorbed all the POACurrent code into the poa.*
          files.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp (operator==): Added comparison operator for
          TAO::ObjectKey.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_poa_current and resolve_poa): Made sure
          that we return the colocated class and not the implementation
          class.

        * tao/orbobj.h (objref.): POA_init was deprecated.  Please use
          orb->resolve_initial_references ("RootPOA") instead.

        * tao/objtable.cpp (find): Change the use of auto_ptr(s) to deal
          correctly with explicit constructors.

        Thu Jan 15 17:27:26 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.{h,i}: Added the poa_current() method and internal
        structure so that state is available to the POA and to the upcall.

        * tao/orbobj.{h,cpp}: Added resolve_poa_current() in order to
        return the POACurrent state context.  Added the "POACurrent" to
        one of the things for which resolve_initial_references() works.
        Changed resolve_poa() so that things can compile; the impl isn't
        correct but when the POA stuff gets committed, this will be
        changed accordingly.

        Tue Jan 13 12:15:54 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_operation.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_operation.cpp:
          The stubs and skeletons for operations that have a "native"
          argument or return value simply "throw" a CORBA::MARSHAL
          exception; those methods cannot be called for remote objects.
          I also had to return something when an exception is raised and
          the return type is a "native", we choose to return 0 for lack of
          a better choice.

        Tue Jan 13 10:49:48 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/current.{i,cpp}: Added a first cut at implementations for
        the POA Current impl.

        Mon Jan 12 19:47:42 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.h:
        * tao/poa.cpp:
          Added a _get_stub() method that encapsulates code common to all
          _this implementations.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
          The _this() method implementation was changed to use the new
          _get_stub finally adding full support for the standard poa, some
          changes were required in the _tao_collocated classes and their
          constructors.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
          Added "manipulators" to increase and decrement indentation
          level.

        Mon Jan 12 14:55:53 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/current.h (class TAO_POA_Current_Impl): Added this as the
        beginning of the implementation for the POA Current.  More to
        come...

        * tao/default_server.*: Added implementations of create_poa_lock()
        and create_poa_mgr_lock() to obtain their values from -ORBpoalock
        and -ORBpoamgrlock options, respectively, to the Default Server
        Strategy Factory specified in svc.conf.  Values for these are
        either "thread" or "null", which specify an ACE_Thread_Mutex or
        ACE_NULL_Mutex, respectively.

        * tao/server_factory.*: Added create_poa_lock() and
        create_poa_mgr_lock() to obtain locks for use in POA and POA
        Manager instances.

        Mon Jan 12 12:10:58 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/objtable.cpp:
          Fixed some problems with misused auto_ptr and dynamic cast that
          was taking away constness at the same time.

        Mon Jan 12 11:55:53 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_poa): Added skeletal code to create root
        POAs using the resolve_initial_references() interface.  Irfan will
        fill in the correct code for actually creating the POA.

        Sun Jan 11 14:09:48 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          Adapted so they compile with the new POA mapping.

        Sun Jan 11 11:33:36 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/connect.cpp:
          On this branch the find() method for POA's require a
          PortableServer::Servant parameter.

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduling_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp:
          Modified to use the new POA mapping for servers.

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp:
          Replaced the old drv_main.cpp with tao_idl.cpp.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs_lib.dsp:
          The final library is not generated inside Debug and its name is
          orbsvcs.lib, not orbsvcs_lib.lib

        Sun Jan 11 10:55:04 CST 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged changes from tag main_to_poa_merge_5 and
          main_to_poa_merge_6. This late merge is risky, needs complete
          validation before public release.

        Thu Jan  8 15:50:59 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_operation.cpp:
          Added support for native as return type.

        Thu Jan  8 13:20:11 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/Makefile:
        * TAO_IDL/be/Makefile:
          Added ast_native and be_native to the list of files.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_native.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_native.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor.h:

          Print an error if the default implementation for write_as_return
          is called.

        Thu Jan  8 12:53:28 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.i (wstring_dup): Added this, which simply calls
        wstring_copy().  Of course, I can't find any mention of EITHER of
        these functions in the 2.0 or 2.1 spec, but what good are wstrings
        if you can't make copies?  Plus, Irfan really wanted it.

        Wed Jan  7 15:09:47 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp:
          This is the actual file generated from idl.yy, thanks to the
          "clone" scheme for building ACE it was lost in the previous
          commits.

        Wed Jan  7 14:17:14 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.{h,cpp} (key_to_object): Changed signature so that
        it's more in line with what we really need.  This is okay because
        this method is not in the standard, so we can choose whatever we
        damn well please!

        Wed Jan  7 14:08:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged changes from version main_to_poa_merge_4 and

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
          Added several fixes for mutiple inheritance, but still needs
          some work.

        Tue Jan  6 15:20:13 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/object.h:
        * tao/object.cpp:
          Removed obsolete methods, they were there to support upcalls on
          the server side, but now this is done on
          PortableServer::ServantBase.

        Tue Jan  6 14:46:27 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
          Added a _get_servant () method to the collocated classes, to
          obtain access to the underlying skeleton.

        Tue Jan  6 13:31:20 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/objtable.h:
        * tao/objtable.cpp:
          Fixed some problems with the PortableServer::ObjectId and
          PortableServer::Servant changes.

        * tao/poa.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          Added a method to get the interface repository name for a
          skeleton.

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Fixed problem on object reference enconding.

        Mon Jan 05 23:41:59 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/objkeyC.cpp:
          The code for memory reallocation was missing, I added it back.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp:
          Fixed bug in object key generation.

        * tao/poa.cpp:
          More debug messages when an object is missing.

        Mon Jan 05 17:46:00 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/poa.h:
        * tao/server_factory.cpp:
        * tao/server_factory.h:
          The ObjectId changes were "accepted for revision" by the POA
          committe, hence I'll commit them, they check them and then I'll
          have to make the changes they require ;-)
          The current scheme uses TAO::ObjectKey as a representation for
          sequence<octet>, this class is generated by the IDL compiler.
          The ORB core uses a typedef (TAO_opaque) for all its internal
          object keys; the current (and deprecated) POA uses ObjectId
          (another typedef on the same thing) as object identifiers.

        Mon Jan  5 13:06:19 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged changes from revision main_to_poa_merge_3 up to revision
          main_to_poa_merge_4.

        * tao/objtable.h:
        * tao/objtable.cpp:
          New Object Table interface, in preparation for the POA needs.

        Sat Jan 03 11:37:21 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_args.cpp:
          Typedefs and predefined types where unproperly handled.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
          Sequences work on Solaris, even Purify gives its "Houston it's a
          go", so I'm reinstating them.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic changes.

        Fri Jan 02 08:31:32 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * Merged changes from revision main_to_poa_merge_2 up to revision
          main_to_poa_merge_3.
          Had to disable sequence test from IDL_Cubit.

        Thu Jan 01 15:43:43 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

        * tao/corbacom.h:
          Added export macros.

        * tao/objtable.cpp:
        * tao/objtable.h:

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_typedef.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_union.h:
          Added methods to be_type to generate the return types; this
          time without any switches, just visitors and virtual
          dispatching.

        * tao/poa.cpp:
        * tao/poa.h:
          Added the methods to lookup operations, this are TAO specific
          and should have complaint names, but currently I just kept the
          old names to avoid a major breakdown.

          Reverted some changes (code moved from be_interface.cpp into
          visitors) to avoid massive conflicts with Andy's changes.

        Tue Dec 30 11:07:06 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.h (TAO_Resource_Factory): Corrected my "fat-finger"
        mistake for the return type of get_allocator ().

        Mon Dec 29 16:26:24 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.{h,cpp}: Added methods for the orb core allocator
        to the resource factory.

        Mon Dec 29 13:18:49 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/Makefile:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_args.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_interface.h:
          Started implementation of the collocated class code generation,
          using the visitor pattern; hence the new be_visitor class and
          some examples of its use.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_type.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_typedef.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
          Added method to obtain the node type for the most "unaliased"
          type though a typedef chain. This is needed in several points
          for code generation.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          Implemented the collocated class generation using visitors,
          ditto for (part of) the main class.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_identifier.cpp:
          Fixed memory deallocation problem. The string was copied using
          ACE_OS::strdup(), but deleted using operator delete[].

          Added the accept() method for the vistor pattern
          implementation.

        Mon Dec 29 11:37:47 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

        Fri Dec 26 12:05:41 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp: Correctly modified the
        make_cubit() method to properly access the underlying object key.

        * tao/objkeyC.cpp: Added this crucial file that I somehow missed
        adding in the last round of changes.

        Wed Dec 24 15:50:38 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp: Removed non-standard
        reliance on underlying object key implementation.  It relied on
        the buffer being publicly-accessible, which is wrong.  However,
        I'm not sure that my interim fix is very "right" since it takes
        the address of operator[](0) to get to the underlying entire
        buffer.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/{IDL_Cubit,MT_Cubit/{server,client}}/Makefile:
        Updated to use rules.tao.GNU.

        * tests/Thruput_test/Makefile: Updated to use rules.tao.GNU.

        * tao/orb.h: Removed unnecessary inclusions of object.h and
        corbacom.h from this file.

        * tao/objkeyC.{h,cpp}: Moved the inclusion of corba.h from the
        header to the implementation because of strange requirements of
        the orb core.  This means that this file CANNOT be used as
        generated by the IDL compiler.

        * tao/{orbobj,stub,object,iiopobj}.cpp: Updated to use the proper
        TAO::ObjectKey_ptr type.

        * tao/Makefile: Updated this after the recent merge that
        accidentally overrote some changes I'd made.

        * taoconfig.mk: Moved the implicit rule into rules.tao.GNU.

        * rules.tao.GNU: Added this file where rules specific to TAO can
        be collected.  Right now it just contains an implicit rule for
        executing the IDL compiler on .idl files.

          + ChangeLog:
          removed all the main truck comments and added the one you are
          reading just now.
          + tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/Makefile:
          + tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/Makefile:
          Left the branch revision, it included the dependencies and had
          correct syntax.
          + tao/poa.cpp:
          CORBA_POA::handle_request was removed on the
          branch but modified on the main revision; keep it removed.

        CORBA::ORB::key_to_object().  It does not compile now, and seems
        as if it's simply an ordering problem of header files.

        * tao/poa.{h,cpp}: Moved handle_request to
        TAO_Server_Connection_Handler and moved create to
        CORBA::ORB::key_to_object.

        * tao/orbobj.{h,cpp}: Added key_to_object as a method to create an
        object reference from an object key and type id.  This code
        actually used to live in POA::create.

        * tao/object.h: Brief documentation twiddling, and renamed
        get_subclass to get_most_derived, which is hopefully more
        explicative.

        * tao/{object,iiopobj,stub}.{h,cpp}: Renamed _get_name to 'key'
        and have it return a TAO_ObjectKey_ptr rather than a const char*.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added typedef for TAO_ObjectKey, which
        represents an object key in GIOP.

        * tao/connect.{h,cpp}: Moved handle_request from the POA into
        here, thereby helping confine IIOP-ness to the ORB Core and
        keeping the POA pristine.

        Thu Dec 11 22:18:52 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Moved the code generation for the
        _var and _out classes before the actual class declaration, but
        after the forward declaration. This was necessary if any elements
        in the scope of the interface are defined to be of the same type
        as that interface. In such a situation those elements are defined
        to be of the _var type. Hence the declaration for _var and _out
        must precede the class declaration.

        Thu Dec 11 22:00:52 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp (main): Fixed a bug
        related to returning an empty string as the ior in the reply from
        the multicast request.

        Thu Dec 11 14:06:50 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_exception,be_state_exception}.cpp: Support for
        exceptions added. Added a new file called
        "be_state_exception.cpp".

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_state.h: Added a new singleton for
        be_state_exception.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp: Template instantiations for
        be_state_exception.

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated to include exception
        support.

        * TAO/tao/except.{h,cpp}: Moved the TypeCode member from the
        private section to the protected section so that derived classes
        can set it. Also, changed the variable from _type to type_ to
        stick to the ACE design standards.

        * ============
        * ============ End of POA branch changes.
        * ============

Fri Jan 23 10:29:17 1998  David L. Levine  <@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/deep_free.cpp (TAO_Marshal_Sequence::deep_free): added
          ACE_UNUSED_ARGs of dest and env.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/{Makefile,y.tab.cpp,y.tab.cpp.diff}: added patch to
          fix up y.tab.cpp to compile cleanly with g++.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/{Makefile,lex.yy,cpp,lex.yy.cpp.diff}: added patch to
          fix up lex.yy.cpp to compile cleanly with g++.

Thu Jan 22 18:18:07 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/GPlot_File.{h,cpp}: Shuffled template
          instantiations and typedef's for ACE_Map_Manager around to
          eliminate compilation errors from g++.

Thu Jan 22 16:32:56 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/nvlist.cpp (is_nil): Fixed some return lines that were
        probably returning the wrong value by not enclosing a comparison
        in parens.  Fortunately we weren't really checking the return
        value on these, I suspect ;-) Thanks to Frederic Andres
        <andres@rd.nacsis.ac.jp> for turning this in.

Thu Jan 22 16:16:32 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosPropertyService_i.cpp, CosPropertyService_i.h, AVStreams_i.cpp, AVStreams_i.h:
        Added empty implementation files for AVStreams and propertyservice implementations

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        Fixed the Makefile so that it will compile the AV related stuff
        only when run as `make av=1`.

Thu Jan 22 14:22:46 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs_lib.dsp: Changed to use multithreaded libraries.

Thu Jan 22 14:20:13 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/{server,client}.dsp:  The project files
          somehow got messed up.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs_lib.dsp: Changed to use multithreaded
          libraries.

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduling_Service.dsp:  Removed
          unnecessary link-time libraries.

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.dsp:  Changed to use
          multithreaded libraries.

Wed Jan 21 20:49:51 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.54, released Wed Jan 21 20:49:51 1998.

Wed Jan 21 19:38:02 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp, decode.cpp: Fixed alignment problem. Done only
        in Marshal_Struct for the time being. Details of this fix will be
        inserted later.

Wed Jan 21 16:27:58 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Updated this to use the new release.pl file below.

        * release.pl: Added new script to take over some of the release
        work rather than having it all inline in the Makefile.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/README: Changed docs to reflect the new
        names and command line requirements.

Wed Jan 21 15:38:52 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Makefile:
          Removed GPlot_File from the list, it does not compile on
          Solaris/g++, but it is not needed.

Wed Jan 21 11:48:19 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp: Updated the ObjRef::encode routine to encode NUL
        object references

        * tests/Param_Test: Further improvements.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_attribute, be_attribute}.cpp: Solved the
        problem of return types. The stubs explicitly allocate the top
        level storage. A similar fix was made for "operations" mentioned
        in a previous ChangeLof entry.

Wed Jan 21 12:23:29 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile:
          Fixed typo in object list for server and client.

Wed Jan 21 11:25:36 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/tmplinst.cpp:
          Removed extra ';' in instantiation pragma.

Wed Jan 21 11:13:56 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/tmplinst.cpp:
        * tao/giop.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiations.

        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
          No need to return const reference to pointer, a simple return
          by value (of the pointer) is OK.

Wed Jan 21 10:38:22 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Added template instantiation
        for Env_Value<unsigned short>.

        * tests/{Thruput/TAO,Param_Test,Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit}/Makefile:
        Added the appropriate tmplinst.* so that it gets built/linked.

        * tests/{Thruput/TAO,Param_Test,Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit}/tmplinst.cpp:
        Added this file, which contains explicit template instantiations
        for code generated by the IDL compiler.  Ideally, this file (or
        something like it) would be generated by the compiler, but we're
        just not there yet.  So, since it's not TOO much work, we do this.

Wed Jan 21 09:40:27 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Fixed allocation problem for operator= in sequences, the new
          buffer should have size "rhs.maximum_", not "this->maximum_"

Wed Jan 21 04:43:57 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added Object_var and ORB_var to the CORBA class
        (i.e., to the namespace)

        * tao/sequence.cpp: Operator= for string sequence still had bugs
        where we were not allocating a larger buffer of the assigned
        quantity was larger than us. Similar bugs *might* be present in
        other sequence classes and I have not tested them yet.

Wed Jan 21 01:34:07 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/{server,client}.cpp: Ifdef'ed out
          ACE_THR_PRIO_FIFO_DEF if it's not defined.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp: We should use
          "ace/streams.h" to include iostream definition instead of using
          <iostream.h> directly.  It is not compatible with the new
          standard CPP libraries.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduling_Service.dsp: It used the
          wrong libraries.

Tue Jan 20 22:59:42 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp: Fixed more typos where it was referring to
        the argument as 'seq' rather than the real name 'rhs'.

Tue Jan 20 22:38:10 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tests/Param_Test/tests.cpp:
          No need to call CORBA::string_free() on opname_, since it is a
          String_var

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Fixed typo in object sequences.

Tue Jan 20 21:53:52 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/TAO_IDL_templates.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiations, they go into their own
          file because I could not think of a "natural" place to put them.

Tue Jan 20 20:25:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence.i:
        * tao/sequence.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Another round of changes, this time fixing several bugs reported
          by Andy and Irfan.

Tue Jan 20 20:23:57 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/nvlist.h:
        * tao/nvlist.i:
          Fixed warnings for IRIX and follow the spec, use const methods
          but return non-const types!

Tue Jan 20 17:00:15 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/strategy_T.h: Added this file to contain template strategies
        such as TAO_Reactive_Strategy<>.

        * tao/default_server.*: Moved TAO_Reactive_Strategy<> into its own
        set of files.  Thanks to Bryan Mendel <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>
        for suggesting this fix!

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp (operator =): Corrected a problem where T**
        was being assigned to T*.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (init): Moved setting of stuff in orb_params()
        to be post-service initialization.  It needs to be this way
        because the ORB Parameters are now regulated by the resource
        factory settings, and that gets created during service
        initialization.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Changed the TAO_GIOP_LocateRequestHeader::init to
        be more efficient and not generate warnings on Irix.

        * tao/{giop,connect}.cpp: Update code that touches ORB-internal
        sequences to use the API of TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<> rather than
        the old crufty code.

        * tao/giop.h: Change ORB-internal sequences (such as the
        ServiceContextList) to use the new TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<>
        template rather than the deprecated CORBA_SEQUENCE<> hack.

Tue Jan 20 09:18:31 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/interp.cpp: Used TAO_opaque to set the size of any
        generic sequence.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_operation,be_state_operation}.cpp: For return
        value of sequences, the stub now allocates the top level storage
        for the sequence class.

Tue Jan 20 05:34:16 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/sequence.cpp: In the assignment operator for Unbounded
        string sequences, we had forgotten to update the max and length
        fields to that of the assigned sequence in the event of it being
        larger than ourselves. We had also forgottent o set our release
        flag to true as well as free the old buffer (if already our
        release flag was true). I have not checked if there are similar
        bugs in other "=" operators or not. But these will be evident as
        more tests are added to the Param_Test example.

Mon Jan 19 23:35:45 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Finished suit of parametric classes for sequences, including
          bounded sequences of objects and strings.
          Fixed some more bugs in the Manager classes for sequences of
          objects.

Mon Jan 19 17:33:45 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/clnt.cpp (init): Changed the marker
        name for the naming service to "NameService" and fixed a bunch of
        places in init() where "1" was being returned instead of "-1".

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/README: Fixed portion that talks about
        the IOR to use the correct default IOR.  Thanks to J Russell
        Noseworthy <j.russell.noseworthy@objectsciences.com> for catching
        this and submitting fixes!

Mon Jan 19 15:41:53 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp (create_servants): Added a
          final return statement to avoid warnings.
          (ACE_THR_PRI_FIFO_DEF): This macro is not defined on NT.  I
          ifdef'ed the priority setting statement out temporarily until we
          figure out a way to map NT's thread priority values to pthread's
          priority values.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.dsp: Updated project file.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (Cubit_Client): Changed the
          data type of <defport> to CORBA::UShort.

        * tests/Param_Test/options.{h,cpp} (portnum): Changed it to type
          CORBA::UShort.

        * tests/Param_Test/helper.cpp (gen_fixed_struct): Added
          parenthesis to avoid warnings.

        * tao/sequence.h (TAO_Unbounded_String_Sequence): Added TAO_Export
          to class TAO_Unbounded_String_Sequence.

Mon Jan 19 11:24:43 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence_T.i:
          g++ does not like nested types in templates.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Updated docs on services.

Sun Jan 18 21:33:21 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence.i:
        * tao/sequence.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Added new class for sequences of strings, the approach based on
          templates was not worth it.
          Also fixed a number of bugs in the unbounded object sequences.
          The following items are in the TODO list:
          + Bounded sequences of objects
          + Bounded sequences of strings.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
          Addded small manipulators to indent and unindent an output
          stream.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
          Synch up with new classes for string and objects.

        * tests/Param_Test/tests.cpp:
          Fixed some problems with the test for sequences of variable
          sized structures.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/CORBA_Utils_T.cpp:
          Fixed unsigned/signed comparison.

Sun Jan 18 18:30:16 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/*.{dsp.MAK}:
        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/*.{dsp,MAK}:  Played with exported
          makefiles some more.  It's ultimately funny that when a project
          file has some customed build commands in it, the exported
          makefile sometime won't work correctly.

Sat Jan 17 23:41:33 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added more MSVC makefiles in some test directories.

        * tests/Param_Test/{client,server}.dsp: Correct idl generated
          files' dependency.

Sat Jan 17 22:40:29 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/orbobj.{h,i}: Added _var and _out for CORBA_ORB

Sat Jan 17 21:28:05 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/corbacom.h:
          Moved the definition of TAO_opaque from corbacom.h to corba.h so
          it appears after the "sequence.h" file.

        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence.cpp:
          Reorder includes to avoid "inline called before declared so"
          warning in g++.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
          The OA uses TAO_opaque instead of CORBA::OctetSeq.

Sat Jan 17 16:07:51 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_args.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_args.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_interface.h:
          New visitors to generate collocated classes (only used on the
          POA branch) and the arguments declaration.

Fri Jan 16 23:38:38 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
        * tao/giop.h:
        * tao/iiopobj.cpp:
        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Fixed some memory *deallocation* problems with sequences, they
          needed a _deallocate_buffer() method, not to implement the base
          class destructor, but to implement deep_free.

Fri Jan 16 18:01:03 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * The Event Service works on Solaris/SunCC again.

        * tao/poa.h:
        * tao/poa.cpp:
        * tao/objtable.h:
        * tao/objtable.cpp:
        * tao/connect.cpp:
          The object table, and POA use a real TAO_Unbounded_Sequence,
          removing some nasty casts.

        * tao/sequence_T.i:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Fixed some memory allocation problems in operator=

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          No need to cast the object key when calling POA::bind(), it
          takes a TAO_opaque now.

Thu Jan 15 17:15:29 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/iioporb.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/poa.cpp:
          Now TAO_opaque is implemented using the new TAO_*_Sequence
          classes, this is needed because the demarshaller expects that
          class.   There are some other sequences in the ORB core that
          need the same change, but currently that is not so urgent.
          The object table expects a CORBA_SEQUENCE so some casting is
          still done among those classes and the new templates.  The POS
          branch already solved this, so I will wait until the merge to
          fix it.

        * TAO/tao/sequence_T.h:
        * TAO/tao/sequence_T.i:
        * TAO/tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Now we include sequence_T.i in sequence_T.h, this is needed for
          template instantiation.
          The ACE_ASSERT for indices was comparing to the value of
          length_, it must compare with maximum_, it is possible that the
          user creates the sequence with enough space (thus maximum_ is
          properly set, but length_ is 0), then inserts some data and
          finally sets the length, with the previous asserts that would
          fail.

Wed Jan 14 23:10:13 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * sequence.h:
        * sequence.i:
        * sequence.cpp:
        * sequence_T.h:
        * sequence_T.i:
          More generated and parametric code reduced, also fixed some
          problems  detected by MSVC++.

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * TAO_DL/tao_idl.dsp:
          Updated projects to include new files.

Wed Jan 14 21:03:18 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@swarm.cs.wustl.edu>

        * sequence.h:
        * sequence.i:
        * sequence.cpp:
          Removed unused TAO_Unbounded_String class, it has been
          superseeded by
          TAO_Unbounded_Managed_String<char,TAO_String_Manager>.

        * sequence_T.h:
        * sequence_T.i:
          Managed sequences only need the const version of operator[],
          because they return a Manager by value.

Wed Jan 14 20:32:47 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/sequence_T.h:
          Fixed typo in base class for ACE_Bounded_Managed_Sequence.

Wed Jan 14 17:54:31 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_sequence.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interpretive.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          The compiler generates code using the new managed sequence
          parametric classes.
          Also handled typedefs correctly while generating sequence code
          specially template arguments and return types for operator[] in
          _var and _out classes.
          Simplified code generation for sequences of sequences: the
          generated typedefs can be used to instantiate the templates.
          Finally made some of the visitors more generic, so less
          knowledge on the stream files gets distributed.

        * tao/sequence.h:
        * tao/sequence.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
          Re-implemented the Managed_Sequence classes using the "Manager"
          as a parameter instead of a nested type.
          Still requires some work because the sequences need privileged
          access (friend) to the Managers.

Tue Jan 13 15:55:32 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (INSTALL): Added a rule to build the INSTALL file from
        TAO-INSTALL.html.  Also added both TAO-INSTALL.html and INSTALL to
        the list of files included in the release.  TAO-INSTALL.html had
        not been included at all.

        * TAO-INSTALL.html: Updated some of the text in the Unix portion
        to be explicit regarding the need for GNU Make.

        * INSTALL: Added this file, which is the output of 'lynx -dump
        TAO-INSTALL.html'.

Mon Jan 12 20:04:32 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp: Added comments

Mon Jan 12 17:29:44 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: Added initialization for an abstract
        visitor factory in the constructor and deletion in the
        destructor.

        Added code for the "make_visitor" factory method.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_factory.cpp: Added destructor and constructor for
        abstract factory (*note* it is not pure abstract).

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_produce.cpp: We use the different visitors for the
        root to start code generation. At this time, we instantiate the
        visitor factory with the concrete factory of visitors which will
        generate stubs/skeletons  using TAO's interpretive marshaling
        engine.

        * TAO_IDL/be_be_sequence.cpp: Commented out a large part of code
        to enable visitors for sequences to take over code generation.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor.cpp: Abstract factory of visitors.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_visitor_root, be_visitor_sequence}.cpp: visitors
        for Root and Sequences respectively. be_visitor_sequence.cpp is a
        new file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/{be_codegen, be_visitor, be_visitor_root,
        be_visitor_sequence, be_factory, be_sequence}.h: Files affected
        due to introduction of visitors and visitor factory. Added a
        boolean "unbounded ()" method on sequences.

        * TAO/tao/{decode, encode}.cpp: Uses TAO_Base_Sequence instead of
        the hack of using CORBA_SEQUENCE<Octet>.

        * TAO/tao/{sequence, sequence_T}.{h,i,cpp}: Added large amount of
        code for bounded and unbounded sequences as well as the special
        cases for sequences of object references and strings, along with
        their managed types.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Added tests for object references and
        sequence of variable structs. There are some problems with the
        generated code.

Sun Jan 11 11:15:35 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/sequence.i (TAO_Base_Sequence): reordered initializers to match
          declaration order.

        * tao/nvlist.h: changed AddRef and Release declarations to return
          CORBA::ULong instead of ULONG, to match their definitions.

Sat Jan 10 14:08:09 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          We no longer generate names with CORBA_1 or CORBA_3 macros, but
          sometimes we cannot use the typedefs in CORBA:: because some
          weird MSVC++ features (bugs?).

Fri Jan 09 21:37:39 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
          Added missing accept() method for visitors.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Runtime_Scheduler.cpp:
          Fixed signed/unsigned warning.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp:
          Yet another fix for the namespace warnings.

Fri Jan  9 20:49:41 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp: Fixed some code dealing
        with Warning (Anachronism) messages.

Fri Jan  9 19:04:10 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Moved template instantiation codes around to
          eliminate compilation errors.

        * tao/sequence_T.cpp:
        * tao/sequence_T.h:
        * tao/sequence_T.i:
          Added the new TAO_Base_Sequence class and its parametric
          children (TAO_Bounded_Sequence and TAO_Unbounded_Sequence). This
          classes will be used in the implementation of all the IDL
          sequences, thus providing the interpreter with a base class to
          manipulate them.

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler.cpp:

Fri Jan  9 16:17:37 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.*: Changed ORB parameters, OA parameters, and the
        endpoint address to be switchable btw. global and tss resources.
        I also cleaned up the redundant accessor methods by using macros
        to define them.  Thanks to Keith Nicewarner <knicewar@sanders.com>
        for his bug reports which led to this solution.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (run,perform_work): Added code to set the
        Reactor's owner to the current thread prior to calling
        handle_events().  Thanks to Keith Nicewarner
        <knicewar@sanders.com> for his bug reports which led to this
        solution.

Fri Jan  9 16:00:21 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Removed a Release statement that
        was getting generated in the _narrow method

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_argument, be_state_operation}.cpp: All
        typedefed strings are handled as if they are strings.

Fri Jan 09 12:29:55 1998    <coryan@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/default_server.cpp:
          Fixed missing initialization for object_lookup_strategy_

Fri Jan  9 12:17:02 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@swarm.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Dispatching_Modules.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/GPlot_File.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Memory_Pools.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler_Generic.cpp:
          Added missing instantiation for platforms with
          ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_PRAGMA (IRIX)

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/CORBA_Utils_T.h:
          Added missing member to ACE_ES_Array_Iterator.

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler.h:
          Use ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX instead of ACE_HAS_THREADS and
          ACE_Null_Mutex vs ACE_Thread_Mutex.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          The IDL generated files are .PRECIOUS

Thu Jan  8 21:58:18 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: be_interface::relative_skel_name ()
        was producing incorrect results because we were overwriting an
        internal string with '\0'

        * TAO/tao/deep_free.cpp: Marshal_Struct::deep_free. Commented out
        the call to String::deep_free if a member is a string because that
        free should happen automatically as the member is a String_var
        type. In addition, String::deep_free was setting the pointer to 0.

        * TAO/tao/marshal.i: In string::deep_free, commente dout the line
        that sets the pointer to 0.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Added a string member field to the
        var_struct. Also some modifications. Needs more improvement.

Thu Jan 08 17:48:49 1998    <coryan@CHA-CHA>

        * Naming_Service/NS_CosNaming.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp:
          ACE_NESTED is only needed in the generated code.

        * Scheduling_Service/Scheduling_Service.cpp:
          MSVC++ 5.0 seems to have a bug: if the implementation for the
          scheduling service is stored into a RtecScheduler::Scheduler_ptr
          then the server crashes; this is OK in other platforms and looks
          OK since the pointers are in fact compatible.

        * tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          Removed some warnings by using "CORBA::ULong" instead of "int"
          in comparisons against sequence<>::length.

        * Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs_lib.dsp:
          Fixed some names and missing options.

Thu Jan 08 15:55:21 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/objtable.cpp:
        * tao/optable.cpp:
        * tao/orbobj.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp: Added missing template
          instantiation codes.

Thu Jan  8 12:53:28 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.i (wstring_dup): Added this, which simply calls
        wstring_copy().  Of course, I can't find any mention of EITHER of
        these functions in the 2.0 or 2.1 spec, but what good are wstrings
        if you can't make copies?  Plus, Irfan really wanted it.

Thu Jan  8 11:36:38 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h, TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        Added a method called "relative_skel_name" to be used for
        generating names of inherited interfaces in the keleton class
        name.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp: Generation of space was
        missing after the "native" type in a parameter list declaration.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/{y.tab.*, lex.yy.cpp}: Due to changes in the idl.ll
        and idl.yy files, these had to be regenerated.

Thu Jan 08 00:14:56 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsw:
        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Dump_Schedule.dsp:

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.dsp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.dsw:
          Added preliminar (untested) versions of the project files for
          MSVC++ 5.0.

Wed Jan  7 22:41:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@swarm.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h:
          Removed varout.h from the list of included files; it is no used
          and would abort compilation on IRIX.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tao/orbobj.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiations.

        * tao/varout.h:
          Some fixes, but actually the changes were aborted, Andy informed
          me that the file wasn't really used.

Wed Jan 07 21:52:20 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp:
          Added the new native_* functions to the project file.
          Also use the new tao_idl.cpp file in the top level directory.

Wed Jan  7 20:20:56 1998  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/NS_CosNaming.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp: Use the correct
        _duplicate function.  Also changed the code to use exceptions
        already supported by TAO.

Wed Jan  7 18:00:08 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile:
        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/Makefile:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_main.cpp:
          Moved the main() routine to the topmost directory, this is
          needed for platforms like SGI that will not link a group of
          shared libraries without any object files. It also seems more
          reasonable (IMHO).

Wed Jan  7 13:55:26 1998  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Changed the assignment of
        default port number to fetch the value from the environment
        similar to what is done in orb_core.cpp.

        * tao/poa.{h,cpp} (handle_request): Moved functionality to
        TAO_Server_Connection_Handler in connect.*.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: Added the ability to specify the default
        server port via an environment variable using the ACE_Env_Value
        template.  The name of the environment variable is the same as the
        preprocessor #define: TAO_DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT.

        * tao/giop.* (TAO_GIOP_LocateRequest): Added a CTOR and init
        method similar to TAO_GIOP_Request.

        * tao/connect.{h,cpp} (handle_locate): Added to handle the
        LocateRequest CORBA request.  Also moved handle_request() method
        from the poa to here.

        * tao/Makefile: Added "fakesvcconf" variable check so that if
        somebody wants to build with faked svc config entries on a
        platform, they can simply do "make fakesvcconf=1".  The CHORUS and
        VXWORKS sections now override the value of this variable to be 1.

Wed Jan  7 12:00:14 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/corbacom.h: Added forward declarations for
        CORBA_Object_var and CORBA_Object_out

        * TAO/tao/varout.h: some improvements. However, this file is not
        used currently.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_native.h: New file that defines the "native"
        type defined by the POA spec.

        * TAO_IDL/include/{ast, ast_interface, ast_module, ast_decl,
        idl_fwd, idl_global, utl_scope}:
        Added the create_native and fe_add_native methods for the newly
        added "native" type. Added a enum value for native in
        AST_Decl.h. Added an enum value for the current parse state in
        idl_global.h. Added forward declarations in idl_fwd.h. Added the
        "add_native" method in utl_scope.h

        * TAO_IDL/ast/{ast_generator, ast_interface, ast_module}.cpp:
        Added the create_native and fe_add_native methods for the newly
        added "native" type.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_native.cpp: New file for native type

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll: Added a rule to recognize the "native"
        keyword.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy: Added a grammar rule for the "native" type.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp: Added add_native and fe_add_native
        methods.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_native.h: New file for the backend for
        "native" type.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_native.cpp: New file for backend implementation of
        "native".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_attribute.cpp: For the "set" method, we were
        setting the paramdata structure of the get method. This has been
        fixed.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp: Added create_native method.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        For a special case of a deeply nested inheritance graph and one
        specific way of inheritance in which a node that was already
        visited, but is not present in the queue, gets inserted at the
        tail. This sitation arises when a node multiply inherits from two
        or more interfaces in which the first parent is higher up in the
        tree than the second parent. In addition, if the second parent
        turns out to be a child of the first. Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan for
        reporting the error.

        In addition, we use the nested_type_name for the inherited classes
        in the class definition.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp: We generate relative paths instead of
        the ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro. However, I am going to make this an
        IDL option at a later point.

        * TAO_IDL: Did "make depend" on all the Makefiles.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Added tests for testing object
        references. This is still incomplete.

Tue Jan  6 19:48:45 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/README: Updated README to explain
        the latest generalization of the MT_Cubit tests.

Tue Jan  6 17:25:57 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * MT_Cubit.dsw,client.dsp,server.dsp: Update workspace and
        project files to reflect the change in directory structure.

Mon Jan 05 23:54:13 1998    <coryan@MILONGA>

        * Added project files for a static orbsvcs library.

Mon Jan  5 16:37:14 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Merged client and server rules

        * server.dsp, svc.conf, svr.cpp, client.dsp, cubit.idl,
        cubit_i.cpp, cubit_i.h, Task_Client.cpp, Task_Client.h,
        Util_Thread.cpp, Util_Thread.h, client.cpp, Makefile:
        Merged client/server code into one directory.

Mon Jan  5 11:50:00 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_attribute.cpp: Code generated for setting the
        attribute value (in the server skeleton) had some undefined symbol
        errors as well as the create_list parameter was wrong.

        * TAO/tao/object.{h.i}: Added code for Object_var and Object_out

Mon Jan 05 09:53:51 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.{h,cpp},encode.cpp: replaced defined (VXWORKS) &&
          defined (ghs) with defined (ACE_HAS_WCHAR_TYPEDEFS_CHAR).

        * tao/Makefile: add -DTAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP to
          CPPFLAGS on VxWorks.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Util_Thread.{h,cpp} (Util_Thread ctor):
          rearranged initializers to match declaration order.

Sun Jan 04 17:19:34 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.53, released Sun Jan 04 17:19:34 1998.

Sun Jan  4 13:49:21 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/nvlist.cpp: NamedValue::Release was calling delete, but
        this was not correct since NamedValues are allocated using
        calloc. So now we exclusively call the destructor and free the
        memory using "free".

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/{client.cpp, tests.cpp}: Since we do not
        pass the OUT_LIST_MEMORY flag to create_request, we cannot own the
        return, inout, and out parameters and hence cannot free them.

Sun Jan  4 13:41:41 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp: Fixed prev_priority to
        previous_priority

Sun Jan 04 07:47:52 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.52, released Sun Jan 04 07:47:52 1998.

Sun Jan 04 07:37:31 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.i: Changed ! ACE_LACKS_TEMPLATE_SPECIALIZATION
          to ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_SPECIALIZATION, to be consistent with
          ACE config files.

Sun Jan  4 06:06:28 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/typecode.*: Some modifications in the destruction
        strategy to eliminate fatal errors such as FNH (freeing non-heap
        memory) or FMW (freed memory write). Most of these errors were
        occuring because we were trying to delete our private typecode
        stuff that was not allocated from heap. For example, in case of
        sequences of strings the private member tc_content_type used to
        point to a statically preallocated "tc_string" typecode.

        Also, preliminary support for checking for typecode equality and
        the "member_name" method added.

        Looking at the current private_* methods, it looks like a lot of
        stuff can be abstracted into a few methods. So the next attempt
        will be to eliminate as many of the private_* methods (that do
        repititive work) and replace them with a couple of helper
        methods. In addition, we may not need all those tc_*_known_
        boolean variables. Only one may suffice. All this will be done in
        the next pass.

        * TAO/tao/{except.h, except.cpp, giop.cpp, object.cpp}: Removed
        the TAO_CONST CORBA::String insanity and replaced by const
        char*. This is also in accordance with the mapping as well as
        eliminates strange compiler warnings about assigning const char*
        to char*.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp: We now generate #if defined (..)
        macros for sequences and their managed types to avoid multiple
        declaration/definition errors.

Sat Jan  3 14:58:21 1998  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Task_Client.h, Util_Thread.cpp, Util_Thread.h, client.cpp,
        Task_Client.cpp, Makefile:
        The Util_Thread class basically computes CPU usage. Integrated
        this class with the MT_Cubit test, so that the Util_Thread
        performs computation in the background while the test is
        running. Also extended the test to use `n' clients talking to `n'
        servants.


Sat Jan 03 09:04:28 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/invoke.cpp (ACE_Synchronous_Cancellation_Required):
          disabled on VxWorks to avoid runtime warnings with
          ACE_NOTSUP_VERBOSE, because thr_setcanceltype isn't
          supported there.

        * tao/corba.h: g++/VxWorks doesn't like backslashes at the
          end of comment lines, so replaced a commenting of a #define
          with #if 0.

Fri Jan 02 18:42:31 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.51, released Fri Jan 02 18:42:31 1998.

Fri Jan  2 16:29:20 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/GPlot_File.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler.cpp:
        * tao/connect.cpp:  Added missing explicit template
          instantiations.

Fri Jan 02 10:24:21 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/driver.cpp (main): Added a trailing return in
          main() to prevent MSVC from complaining.

        * tests/Param_Test/helper.cpp (gen_fixed_struct): Changed to use
          ACE_OS::rand () * 1.0 instead of drand48 ().

        * tao/connect.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_service/Gplot_File.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp: Added explicit template
          instantiation for ACE_Map_Iterator_Base.

Fri Jan  2 10:39:02 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp: Completely reimplemented the way
        ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro gets generated.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_sequence.cpp: Fixed an error where the
        reference operator "&" was getting generated at the wrong place.

Wed Dec 31 23:29:59 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/nvlist.cpp (add_value_consume): Added a space between * and
          /* to avoid warning messages on NT.

Thu Jan 01 14:22:34 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.50, released Thu Jan 01 14:22:34 1998.

Thu Jan  1 13:31:55 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_sequence, be_state_sequence}.cpp: An unwanted
        reference operator "&" was getting generated for sequences whose
        element types were not special managed types. This was because the
        case for handling the managed types somehow got mixed with the
        normal ccase. Thanks to Nanbor Wang (nw1@cs.wustl.edu) for
        pointing this out.

Wed Dec 31 18:29:57 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_sequence, be_state_sequence}.cpp: Changed the way
        we use managed types. Instead of allocating an array, we now
        instantiate the
        managed type on the fly i.e., when the operator [] is invoked. The
        reasons for doing this are: (1) no need for dynamic memory
        allocation for maintaining the array of managers (2) It was
        causing all kinds of problems while decoding because the sizeof
        such sequence classes was bigger than those without managed
        types. However, due to this scheme, we can no longer define the []
        operator to return a reference because that would mean that a
        reference to a local variable/temporary will be returned. Hence
        changes were necessary in files.

        TypeCode generation was also erroneous. This is fixed. We were
        generating wrong encapsulation length.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_string.cpp: Indentation in typecode generation.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp: nested_type_name - improved to
        eliminate one more strange error message getting generated by the
        MSVC++ compiler. Still needs testing.

        * TAO/tao/{invoke, decode}.cpp: Reversed the changes which were
        made to account for sequencese with managed types. We no longer
        need these changes because sequences with managed types no longer
        keep an extra data member. Thus the size of all sequences (top
        level) is the same (so is the layout).

        * TAO/tao/nvlist.cpp: commneted out unused variables, parameters.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Included tests for string sequences,
        variable sized structs as well as nested structs.

Tue Dec 30 13:46:44 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h (portnum_): Changed its data
          type from CORBA::ULong to CORBA::UShort to kill warning
          messages.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (create_list): Changed data type of the loop
          counter to CORBA::Long.  This caused a warning message on VC.

        * doc/releasenotes/index.html: Added documentation for adding IDL
          files into Visual C++'s projects.

        * tests/Param_Test/Param_Test.dsw:
        * tests/Param_Test/client.dsp:
        * tests/Param_Test/server.dsp: New workspace and projects were added.

Tue Dec 30 10:15:11 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Fast_Reactor.h (ACE_ES_Fast_Reactor):
          Added the other version of handle_events to stop the compiler
          from being cranky.

Tue Dec 30 10:06:45 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_argument, be_state_operation,
        be_state_attribute}.cpp - Unnecessary call on "init_mgr" for
        sequences that do not have any managed types was getting
        generated. This is fixed. In addition, MSVC++ compiler was
        producing an error saying "ambiguous assignment" when an "_out"
        variable was assigned to a pointer type. Solaris platform (CC and
        g++) did not give any such errors since they were (most probably)
        using the operator *() on the _out class, but MSVC++ did not.

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: The same "ambiguous
        assignment" error described above has been fixed here too.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Added a method called "reset_parameters"
        so that we do not change the "in" parameter for every
        iteration. Previuosly we were settingthe in parameter differently
        for every new iteration. However, for performance comparison
        purposes, this was not correct (e.g., in the case of string
        sequences or unbounded strings where everytime we were sending a
        different lenght string and hence the performance numbers were
        different for each run and couldn't be compared.)

Mon Dec 29 21:51:38 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp: get_name was returning a local
        variable. In addition, added generationof a method called
        "init_mgr" that must be used to initialize the sequence's
        underlying mgr_ vector.

        There was some problem with bounded/unbounded sequence code
        generation (an error  in an if stmt).

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_argument, be_state_attribute,
        be_state_operation}.cpp - added code to generate the call to
        init_mgr for sequences after the do_call is made.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_sequence.h : gen_name returns char* rather
        than const char* because we now allocate a new string and return
        it.

        * TAO/tao/Makefile: applied make depend to incorporate nvlist.i

        * TAO/tao/corbacom.h: Added a "boolean release" field to
        CORBA_SEQUNECE so that its layout is similar to the generated code
        for sequences.

        * TAO/tao/decode.cpp: In sequence decode, we also set the release
        flag to 1. In addition, for sequences of strings and objrefs, we
        zero out additional 4 bytes that are used to store a pointer to
        the manager array.

        * TAO/tao/deep_free.cpp: some indentation. Also passed the correct
        parameter to string/wstring::decode

        * TAO/tao/invoke.cpp: In do_dynamic_call, for sequences of strings
        (inclusing typedefed sequences of strings that themselves can be
        typedefed), we must allocate size+4 bytes for demarshaling the
        sequences. The extra 4 bytes are for the manager array pointer.

        * TAO/tao/nvlist.cpp: I the method item, the loop should have run
        from o to max_ rather than upto len_.

        * TAO/tao/orbobj.cpp: Used placement new of NamedValue in the
        create_list method.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Added new tests for Fixed_Struct and
        string sequence. Added a README file.

        * TAO/doc/releasenotes/index.html: updated with latest success stories.

Thu Dec 25 20:36:58 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.49, released Thu Dec 25 20:36:58 1997.

Thu Dec 25 18:43:03 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_attribute, be_state_argument}.cpp: Handled
        teh remaining cases (except Arrays) that use the newly added
        methiods to class NVList. The Param_Test test suite is being
        developed to track any memory leaks.

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:  Used sequence_var in
        the cube_sequence function to avoid memory leaks. However, there
        still are leaks.

Wed Dec 24 18:44:47 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.48, released Wed Dec 24 18:44:47 1997.

Wed Dec 24 18:44:02 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Added the nvlist.i file to the tao/ directory.

Wed Dec 24 18:11:08 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_operation, be_state_argument}.cpp: Added
        "argument_count" method to be_operation which is helpful in
        creating an NVList of the appropriate size. Previously we were
        creating an empty list and adding parameters one by one. This was
        causing a lot of reallocations which were wasteful.

        At this time, we have code base that can successfully send/receive
        primitive data types as well as strings.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_operation.h : Added a new method called
        "argument_count" to give us the total number of parameters we
        have.

        * TAO/tao/{any.cpp, connect.cpp, corbacom.i, decode.cpp,
        iioporb.cpp, marshal.i, objtable.cpp, optable.cpp, request.cpp}:
        In all these files, after a call to CORBA::string_free, we made
        the pointer point to 0. Otherwise, purify was giving us "Free
        Memory read" errors. Also, this was (by fluke) causing some
        applications to run successfully.

        * TAO/tao/{nvlist.h, nvlist.cpp, nvlist.i, corba.h}: Added
        unimplemented methods to NamedValue and NVList. Created a nvlist.i
        file and updated corba.h

        * TAO/tao/corbacom.cpp: In an assignment operator for Sting_out,
        we were not checking if the assignment was from ourselves. Also a
        array was incorrectly being deleted as "delete ..." rather than
        "delete [] ...".

        * TAO/tao/invoke.cpp: Inside do_call, we were not deleting memory
        for the "in" part of the inout parameters. Right now we have fixed
        this problem only for strings. Others will be added as new tests
        are built. Do_dynamic_call also needs such a fix. NOT DONE in this release.

        * TAO/tao/orb_core.h, orb_core.cpp: ORB_init takes "const char*"
        orb name as the argument instead of just char*.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: Successful in testing
        "test_unbounded_string". removed a few memory leaks where we were
        not deleting the client objects.

        * TAO version 0.0.47, released Tue Dec 23 19:34:40 1997.

Tue Dec 23 13:36:50 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_sequence.cpp: ACE_NESTED_CLASS must be
        generated for seq elements that are scoped. We were generating
        this macor only when seq elements were typedefs. However, seq
        elements can also be structs or any other types that have an
        enclosing scope. Thanks to Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu> for
        the bug report.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_operation.cpp: Similar problem as above for
        return types of operations.  Bug reported by Chris Gill.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp: Whenever a _narrow fails, we were
        trying to do a ACE_dynamic_cast to a 0. Instead, we now return a
        0. Again thanks to Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu> for
        the bug report.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp: We were ot generating a char
        *& for inout string parameters. Instead only a char * was getting
        generated. Fixed.

          $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs.

Mon Dec 22 22:02:49 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/except.cpp:
        * tao/except.h:
          The TAO_TRY macros use the _narrow methods for exceptions;
          making the TAO_CATCH() macro fully functional.

          Changed the ACE_TRY (and friends) macros to TAO_TRY.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl:
          Cleaned up some exceptions definitions.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Makefile:
          Since the schedule is not distributed (yet) by default we
          compile the config run, hopefully this will cause less
          confusion.

Sun Dec 21 18:30:41 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: The macro used in the #if !defined
        (..) clause in the header files was incorrectly generated when IDL
        file names had characters other than letters in it. Fixed.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test: A new test suite to test all the parameter
        passing modes - return, in, inout, and out for a large number of
        IDL data types. The purpose of this test suite is to verify the
        correctness of the stubs/skeletons generated by TAO IDL compiler,
        eliminate any existing errors in the marshaling engine, track down
        any memory leaks, and finally to measure the performance and fine
        tune the code if required. In the first version of the test, we
        only test "shorts". We will be adding other tests as soon as we
        can.

Thu Dec 18 15:06:23 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>
        Thanks to Keith Nicewarner <knicewar@sanders.com>, Tom Richards
        <tomr@mcmenterprise.com>, and Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>
        for reporting bugs which led to  some of the changes below.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp: Preliminary support for arrays. Not
        complete.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_operation, be_attribute}.cpp: The ParamData
        structure *must* hold the "size" of the outermost level of the
        return values and out parameters because the ORB has to allocate
        memory for it and hence needs to know the size. We had a 0 in it
        which crashed any return types that were variable in size.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: Added a new state for
        unions. Corresponding change to the *.h file.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp: Added a method called "scope" that
        returns the corresponding scope defined by this node (if one
        exists). Added method to the *.h file also.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_scope.cpp: Added a method called "decl" that
        returns the be_decl method corresponding to this scope. The header
        file was also updated.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_exception, be_state_exception}.cpp: I was making
        the most stupid mistake of generating constructors per member
        rather than one constructor that takes all the members as a
        parameter.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_sequence, be_state_sequence}.cpp: Changed the
        naming scheme for anonymous sequences to avoid code bloat.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp: Added template instantiation for
        additional state to deal with code generation of members of
        unions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_structure.cpp: Made some changes so that
        spurious code for array members doesn't get generated.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_union, be_state_union}.cpp: Added a new state
        because we were not generating code for union members that were
        sequences or structs.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp: Modified netsed_type_name to use the new
        methods on class be_decl/be_scope.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp: gen_client_stubs uses the same
        strategy as the other gen_client methods.

        * TAO/tao/deep_free.cpp: In deep_free of structures, instead of
        passing the address of a string member to be freed, we were simply
        passing the string that led to a segmentation fault. A careful
        code review is necessary.

        * TAO/tao/orb_core.cpp: Made "use_ior" as default as ooposed to
        using the URL based scheme for IORs. This was necessary to have
        interoperability with other ORBs.

        * TAO/tao/poa.cpp: The server request was being released
        immediately after returning from the dispatch method. This should
        be done after all return/inout/out parameters are marshaled.

Tue Dec 17 12:53:01 1997  Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/encode.cpp: Additional changes for wchar's

Tue Dec 17 10:37:45 1997  Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/TAO.dsp: Removed obsolete files from the VC++ project.
          Changed name of folder from Include Files to Inline Files.
          Inserted new header files for classview.

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp: Added missing be_state_exception.cpp to the
          the project to eliminate link error.

        * tao/corbacom.cpp: Inserted wslen and wscpy back to handle wchar
          problems with VxWOrks and GHS.

        * tao/encode.cpp: Inserted wslen and wscpy back to handle wchar
          problems with VxWOrks and GHS.

Tue Dec 16 18:29:42 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/README:
        * docs/orbsvcs.html:
          Started up the documentation for TAO services, at this point
          only the directory hierarchy is explained.

Tue Dec 16 08:49:11 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h: Added three more states for
        return types to be generated for operator [] of sequences of
        strings and object references.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_sequence.h: Added enum constants to
        indicate what kind of managed type is handled by the sequence. For
        sequences other than that of strings and objrefs, this enum const
        is MNG_NONE. Added a new method that returns the managed type.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_sequence, be_state_sequence.cpp}: Added code to
        generate sequences of strings and objrefs. This requires
        generating special "managed" objects. In addition, for
        be_state_sequence.cpp, we were not handling the case where base
        types of sequences were not having any scope which resulted in
        segmentation faults.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_argument, be_state_operation}.cpp: Some
        small bugs fixed. These included lack of a whitespace in the
        generated code as well as spurious extra level of indirection
        getting generated.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp: "nested_type_name" now checks if the
        scope with which are comparing is NUL or not before proceeding
        further. Such a situation may arise for sequences whose base types
        are anonymous (e.g., strings) and have no enclosing scope.

        * TAO/tao/managed_types.{h,cpp,i}: Removed. No more needed as teh
        code is generated by the IDL compiler. Accordingly modified
        corb.h and did a "make depend" on the Makefile.

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated to reflect new changes
        as well as TO-DO stuff such as adding support for TIEs.

Mon Dec 15 22:31:50 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.43, released Mon Dec 15 22:31:50 1997.

Mon Dec 15 19:13:51 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Timeprobe.cpp:
          Removed Solaris specific code, somehow it survived from some
          debugging session. Thanks to Arturo Montes
          <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for pointing out this bug.

Mon Dec 15 16:52:58 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO-INSTALL.html: Added some explanations for setting CPP_PATH
          on NT.

Mon Dec 15 16:49:58 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (cube_sequence): declare
          local variables "l" and "j" as u_int instead of int, to avoid
          signed/unsigned comparison.

Thu Dec 11 16:44:26 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Config_Scheduler.cpp:
          Fixed typo missed on the previous release.

Thu Dec 11 22:18:52 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Moved the code generation for the
        _var and _out classes before the actual class declaration, but
        after the forward declaration. This was necessary if any elements
        in the scope of the interface are defined to be of the same type
        as that interface. In such a situation those elements are defined
        to be of the _var type. Hence the declaration for _var and _out
        must precede the class declaration.

Thu Dec 11 22:00:52 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.cpp (main): Fixed a bug
        related to returning an empty string as the ior in the reply from
        the multicast request.

Thu Dec 11 14:06:50 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_exception,be_state_exception}.cpp: Support for
        exceptions added. Added a new file called
        "be_state_exception.cpp".

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_state.h: Added a new singleton for
        be_state_exception.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp: Template instantiations for
        be_state_exception.

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated to include exception
        support.

        * TAO/tao/except.{h,cpp}: Moved the TypeCode member from the
        private section to the protected section so that derived classes
        can set it. Also, changed the variable from _type to type_ to
        stick to the ACE design standards.

Thu Dec 11 00:01:41 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.42, released Thu Dec 11 00:01:41 1997.

Wed Dec 10 23:04:04 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service/Config_Scheduler.cpp:
          Still struggling with g++, it seems to use the wrong cast for
          IDL generated T_out classes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/svr.cpp:
          These files were missed in the orbsvcs hierarchy
          reorganization.

Wed Dec 10 22:38:08 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit: Fixed the  hand-crafted code to
        make use of the many changes that were made to the dispatching
        scheme as well as changes made to the signature of the skeletons
        for operations of interfaces.

Wed Dec 10 21:41:48 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated the release notes on the
        Naming Service.

Wed Dec 10 20:13:57 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile:
          Added orbsvcs to the hierarchy.

        * The orbsvcs directory was completely reorganized, in preparation
          for its official release. The new hierarchy is:
          - orbsvcs/orbsvcs: Contains a library with:
            + The client stubs for the services.
            + Common utility classes to access the services.
            + The server skeletons, but not their implementation.
          - orbsvcs/Naming_Service: the COSS Naming Service.
          - orbsvcs/Scheduling_Service: TAO Real-Time Scheduling Service.
          - orbsvcs/Event_Service: TAO Real-Time Event Service.
          - orbsvcs/tests: test programs and examples.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Updated documentation on the Event Service and its friends.

Wed Dec 10 19:57:07 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp (Cubit_i::cube_sequence):
        Changed to explicitly use the vector_out::ptr() method to get a
        ptr.  It seems that g++ wanted to interpret this expression
        (output == 0) differently from Sun's C++, and this made both
        interpret it in the desired way.

Wed Dec 10 14:23:24 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_structure.cpp:
          Fixed a bug when handling typedefs.
          It was generating code for imported types, we protected the
          generation with a !imported(), thank to Andy Gokhale
          <gokhale@cs.wustl.edu> for helping me on this.

        * tao/connect.cpp:
          Set the TCP_NODELAY option by default, otherwise oneway calls
          are considerably slower.  It should have no effect for twoway
          calls.  Anyway an option should be added to control this
          behavior.

Wed Dec 10 13:15:11 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/{be_array, be_decl, be_field, be_module,
        be_operation, be_predefined_type, be_structure, be_typedef}.h:
        Added a protected function called "compute_size_type" which is
        invoked if the size type of a data structure is not known in
        advance. This happens for structs, unions, arrays, and typedefs
        whose size type depends on their base types.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_array, be_decl, be_field, be_module,
        be_operation, be_predefined_type, be_structure, be_typedef}.cpp:
        Implementation of the "compute_size_type".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp: Changed code that sets "size_type" so
        that we first see if we are unknown in which case we set our size
        type. However, once we are VARIABLE, no body can reset us to
        fixed. Similarly, the overloaded size_type method that return the
        size type first checks if our size is still unknown in which case
        it calls for "compute_size_type". This is very essential for data
        types defined in an imported (included) *.idl file. Thanks to Tom
        Richards (tomr@mcmenterprise.com) for reporting the bug with
        included file which resulted in this change.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_attribute.cpp: Included a case for
        IN_PARAM_TYPE_CH for strings (had previously forgotten to do so).

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state_structure, be_structure, be_field}.cpp:
        Revamped so that we use the same switch based technique in
        be_state_structure.cpp to generate code. For fields that are
        sequences or structures or unions, we also generate their code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp: Thanks to Tom Richards and
        Carlos O'Ryan for noticing a bug when we use out sequences. There
        used to be a seg fault in deep_free.cpp because a NUL pointer was
        being owned by an Any and getting freed. In the server skeleton,
        for out params we now generate code after the upcall is made so
        that for out parameter value is inserted in the NVList that is
        marshaled by the server.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: In the generated call to _is_a, we
        were calling CORBA::Object::_is_a if a remote call is
        necessary. However, MSVC++ cannot handle a call of the form
        CORBA::Object::_is_a. So we have to generate code that uses
        ACE_CORBA_3 so as to be portable. Thanks to Nanbor Wang
        (nw1@cs.wustl.edu).

        * TAO/test/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Changed the type of the
        variable that was passed as the out parameter to cube_sequence.

Wed Dec 10 01:02:36 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp (set): Added a special case to IIOP Profile::set
        so that if the address is INADDR_ANY, it uses the host name, but
        otherwise uses the IP address.  This eliminates the cryptic
        appearance of the address "0.0.0.0" in a server's IOR.

Tue Dec  9 21:48:52 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
          The sequence test is not running right now, I'm commenting it
          out until we can make it work properly.

Tue Dec  9 18:02:43 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: The moral of this changelog entry is to be
        VERY careful when cutting and pasting code...the
        resource_factory() accessor should not be setting the
        client_factory_ member at all!

Tue Dec  9 11:55:50 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Added NOERROR as #define if we're not on
        WIN32 so that IDL-generated code would continue to work.

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp: Changed faked Resource Factory resource
        source specifier to "tss" rather than "global".

        * tao/orb_core.*: Added resource_factory() accessor to
        TAO_ORB_Core.  This will create a default instance if it can't
        locate one in the Service Repository, which will allow
        applications to not encounter a hard failure when a svc.conf file
        is missing.  A warning message is emitted stating that a default
        is being used.  Applications should not rely on the default
        settings, as it is very likely that the applicat might require
        alternate settings for proper desired operation.

        * tao/default_server.*: Added TAO_Reactive_Strategy template
        class to use in place of the ACE_Reactive_Strategy.  It's only
        difference from ACE_Reactive_Strategy is that instead of using the
        reactor provided in the open method, it always uses that found
        through the TAO_ORB_Core_instance().  This fix was motivated by a
        general problem which was only observable on VxWorks with a
        special pseudo-network transport.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Added code to fail gracefully if socket buffer
        size changes are not supported.

Mon Dec  8 13:11:46 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Added more information on how the Event Channel and friends are
          going.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svc.conf:
          Removed some foreign ^M from the file.

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tao/connect.cpp:
        * tao/giop.cpp:
        * tao/orbobj.cpp:
        * tao/Timeprobe.i:
        * tao/Timeprobe.h:
        * tao/Timeprobe.cpp:
          Added a instrumentation class to measure time interval, also
          instrumented some code, as part of the ongoing effort to
          optimize the EC, unfortunately the problems are not in TAO ;-)
          The code is only instrumented if compiled using probe=1, no
          overhead is introduced in normal compiles.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h:
          Addded code to test sequences (as input and output parameters)
          they don't work (yet).

        * orbsvcs/lib/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Timeprobe.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Timeprobe.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Timeprobe.cpp:
          The file was moved to $TAO_ROOT/tao.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          Fixed default dump file, it was using stdout!

Sat Dec 06 15:42:25 1997    <nw1@DINGO>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/{server,client}.dsp: Updated link time

        * tao/compat/initguid.h:
        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Removed dependencies on Microsoft's DCOM
          files.  Below is a list of names that got changed.

            HRESULT -> TAO_HRESULT
            IID -> TAO_IID
            IUnknown -> TAO_IUnknown
            IID_IUnknown -> IID_TAO_IUnknown

            DATE -> TAO_DATE

Fri Dec  5 11:42:25 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp (set): Changed the IIOP::Profile::set() methods
        which take an ACE_INET_Addr to retrieve the host IP address rather
        than host name for storage in the profile.  This is motivated by
        the following situation: machine has 3 interfaces (not including
        loopback), and it is desired that clients and servers communicate
        across only one interface.

        When our IDL_Cubit example's factory created new Cubit instances,
        the set() method would set the host name for that IIOP::Profile to
        whatever ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_name() returned.  In this case,
        the IP addr for interface 3 (which is not the primary interface)
        would return a *LIST* of names in which the first name was that of
        the primary interface.  Thus, the IP address used by the client
        would be wrong.

        * tao/object.h: Minor corrections to header comments.

        * tao/{orb_core,orbobj}.{h,cpp}: Moved server_factory and
        client_factory ptr storage from CORBA_ORB to TAO_ORB_Core.  It
        really didn't belong there in the first place.

        * tao/poa.cpp: CTOR now fetches server factory ptr from the
        TAO_ORB_Core rather than from the ORB.

Thu Dec  4 18:20:55 1997  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp: Changed hard coded path for cl.exe to CPP_PATH
          environment variable

Thu Dec  4 11:23:55 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/include/{idl,ast,utl_idlist, utl_identifier}.h: removed
        #include "ace/stdcpp.h" since this file was removed from
        ACE. Instead we now include "ace/streams.h" in idl.h

        Also made make depend on all the Makefiles.

Wed Dec  3 16:08:34 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Added some more time-stamps to the events to track and measure
          the delays as they move on the EC.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminS.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.i:
          Thanks to Andy Gokhale efforst the IDL compiler is able to emit
          proper code for the EC&friends, hence I'm removing the
          hand-crafted files.

Wed Dec  3 11:12:48 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Had forgotten to emit code that
        adds one more cast to the base POA_* class in the generated *S.i
        file.

Wed Dec 03 09:40:36 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile: added TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP to
          CPPFLAGS on CHORUS.  Thanks to Wei Chiang for this change.

Tue Dec  2 15:47:09 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.h: Added some helper methods to generate
        additional code in the form of larger operation tables, and
        skeletons. This situation arises when we have single/multiple
        inheritance of interfaces.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Included ace/Containers.h for the
        ACE_Unbounded_Queue that uses the breadth-first strategy used in
        be_interface.cpp

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_interface,be_operation,be_attribute}.cpp: Added code
        to generate a new "virtual void dispatch" method on the skeleton
        classes. The dispatch method enables us to access the most derived
        type when invoking the skeleton for a method. The skeletons
        instead of taking a CORBA::Object_ptr, now take void*. The
        skeletons themselves cast this void* to the appropriate POA_*
        type.

        In addition to the above, for the case of inheritance of
        interfaces, it is not appropriate to pass a pointer to the most
        derived class as a void* to the skeleton of a base class and cast
        that to the POA_* of the base class. So we generate inlined code
        for skeletons of methods in the most derived class even if those
        methods were defined in the base classes. These inlined skeletons
        simply cast the object pointer to the right type and invoke the
        corresponding skeleton of the base class method.

        be_interface.cpp defines a template method to traverse the entire
        inheritance graph. This traversal is done using a breadth-first
        traversal. This traverse method takes a pointer to one of the
        static helper methods defined on class be_interface. Each helper
        achieves a different purpose such as generation of extended
        operation tables, providing comparisons of repositoryIDs of base
        classes in the _is_a methods of derived classes.

        The client-side class now defines a virtual CORBA::Boolean _is_a
        method. This uses local knowledge of repository ids thereby
        preventing the expensive remote call in most cases. All changes
        made in be_interface.cpp

        * TAO/tao/corbacom.h: Changed the signature of TAO_Skeleton so that
        it uses void*obj and a void *context.

        * TAO/tao/object.h: Added a virtual dispatch method as explained
        above.

        * TAO/tao/orb.h: Redefinition of TAO_Skeleton removed.

        * TAO/tao/poa.cpp: Changed the demultiplexing code to reflect the
        change made with the dispatch method. The poa on finding the right
        object corresponding to the key, now invokes the dispatch method
        on that object which by dynamic binding invokes the dispatch
        method of the POA_* class.

Tue Dec 02 15:29:41 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/{connect,orb_core}.h: Moved Win32 specific template
          specialization declaration from connect.h to orb_core.h because
          the definition had moved to orb_core.i.

        * tao/object.cpp: Removed conditional directives around
          DEFINE_GUID for IID_IUnknown.  This is now defined for Win32
          also.

        * tao/TAO.dsp: Removed macro definition __IIOP_BUILD.  It was not
          used anywhere.

Tue Dec  2 10:25:47 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h:
          Fixed some problems with the ACE_RETHROW macros.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Timeprobe.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Timeprobe.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Timeprobe.cpp:
          Added a high resolution timer facility, to measure the delays in
          the Event Channel and in its client.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Changed the time_ field of Event to a double. It should be an
          structure or a long long, but double is big enough to store

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminS.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventCommC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventCommC.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventCommS.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.h:
          Regenerated the files using the newest IDL compiler; still some
          hand crafting due to inherited classes.

Tue Dec  2 03:12:50 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Check for errors when
        resolving using the "NameService" environment variable.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp (NS_NamingContext):
        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.h (NS_NamingContext):
        - Added constructor that takes a key to initialize the object,
        instead of using the default name generation.
        - Enabled some exceptions that are already supported.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svr.cpp (main): Create first naming
        context with key "NamingContext".  And minor changes.

        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/README:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h:
        * tests/Cubit/CORBAplus/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp: Ported the IDL cubit
        example to CORBAplus.  Currently, the calls using DII are not
        ported, so only the "cube average" and the "cube_union_stub" stats
        are printed.

Mon Dec  1 16:51:08 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/except.{h,cpp}: Changed semantics of CORBA::Exception so
        that the mere creation of them does not take a reference.
        Instead, the user of the exception is expected to call AddRef().
        CORBA::Environment has been modified (and even documented!) to
        reflect that as well.

Sun Nov 30 17:08:56 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.cpp:
          Added missed parameter in do_call() for
          RtecScheduler::Scheduler::set().

Sat Nov 29 13:34:58 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/stub.i (STUB_Object):
          No need to release type_id, since it is a String_var now. Thanks
          to Wei Chiang <chiang@tele.nokia.fi> for pointing this out.

        * giop.cpp:
          If things go wrong TAO_GIOP::send_request will close the
          handler and set it to zero, but only a temporary was
          affected, I decided to set the original value to zero also;
          based on the return value.

Wed Nov 26 23:24:57 1997    <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.41, released Wed Nov 26 23:24:57 1997.

Wed Nov 26 16:40:29 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Changed release calls to use
        the CORBA standard version rather than the non-standard TAO
        Release() method.  Also moved the client's parse_args() AFTER the
        ORB_init() so that -ORB parameters were parsed correctly.

        * tao/params.*: Added storage for send and receive socket buffer
        size to be used for all newly created sockets.  These sizes are
        initialized to ACE_DEFAULT_MAX_SOCKET_BUFSIZ, and can be changed
        by the user by using -ORBsndsock and -ORBrcvsock.

        * tao/orbobj.h: Added documentation.

        * tao/orb_core.i: Changed system-specific conditional compilation
        to use the more general ACE_LACKS_TEMPLATE_SPECIALIZATION.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: Added code to make -ORBsndsock and -ORBrcvsock
        options actually work.  Added -ORBpreconnect option to implement
        pre-cached connections.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Removed the old static inline version of
        start_message().  Also changed to use send_n() to guarantee
        correct blocking nature on Win32 with the WFMO Reactor.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Changed set_option() calls to use the socket
        buffer sizes stored in the TAO_ORB_Parameters instance.  Also
        added a correct environment-clearing call before initializing a
        request.

        * tao/client_factory.h: Removed extraneous code.

        * tao/{connect,any,giop,iiopobj,marshal,nvlist,objtable,optable,
               orb_core,poa,principa,stub,svrrqst,typecode}.h:
        Addressed or assigned some '@@' comments.

        * docs/releasenotes/orbcore.html: Added information regarding new
        options, known bugs, etc.

        * docs/Options.html: Added documentation for new -ORBpreconnect
        option.

        * TAO_IDL/be/Makefile: Added an explicit PIC=-fPIC for when g++ is
        being used as the compiler.  This fixes the linker complaints.

Sat Dec 20 14:57:30 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * All MSVC 5.0 project files: Removed unnecessary library
          inclusions.  Most of them are not necessary.

Tue Nov 25 20:49:24 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.h:
        * tao/orbobj.cpp:
        * tao/orb_core.cpp:
        * tao/params.h:
        * tao/params.cpp:
          Removed the parameters to specify the event service and schedule
          service IOR, the naming service is working now so it can be
          used. And the support in "resolve_initial_references".

        * tao/corbacom.i:
        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Reverted the previous change, but this time added proper
          comments: the spec says that a Naming_var taking a <char*> is
          *not* supposed to copy it. Hence the ObjRef decoder cannot
          release the string it just read.

Mon Nov 24 20:40:47 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.i:
          Fixed string allocation problem for String_var(char*): if it
          does not copy the string we run into problems with the
          demarshalling code.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.h:
          Removed the unused forward_event parameter in the ConsumerQoS.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.i:
          Hand crafted the T_out constructors to take a "const T_out&"
          instead of just "T_out&".

Sat Nov 22 18:21:10 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h, be/be_codegen.cpp: Added a
        number of states to handle attributes

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_attribute,be_state_attribute}.cpp: Code added to
        handle attributes. This code is a mix of code that is used to
        handle operations as well as arguments because for attributes we
        have 2 methods, one to set the value and one which returns the
        value. For a readonly attribute, there is only the get method.

        A special note: Due to the large switch statement, I had to use
        -fPIC for g++. We are working on abstracting all the commin
        functionality once we have the basic IDL compiler working.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Operation table now also includes
        methods to set and get the attributes if they are present. In
        addition, the variable name for the operation tables is now the
        full flattened name to avoid conflicts.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp: In the length method, the index of
        lookp variable "i" is changed from "int" to CORBA::ULong as g++
        was issuing a warning.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_string.cpp, be_state_argument,cpp: Proper handling
        of in, inout, and out strings that are either anonymous or are
        typedefed.

Fri Nov 21 13:22:39 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.40, released Fri Nov 21 13:22:39 1997.

Thu Nov 20 10:31:24 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h (SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE): Made sure this is defined
        properly for Chorus.  Thanks to Wei Chiang <chiang@tele.nokia.fi>
        for submitting these!

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (init): Added some changes for Chorus.  Thanks
        to Wei Chiang <chiang@tele.nokia.fi> for submitting these!

        * tao/object.cpp (_is_a): Explicitly specify which conversion
        operator to use when comparing type_id to 0.

Thu Nov 20 00:10:52 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.h :
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp (Logger_Client): Fixed a bug
        dealing with using "_bind" when the naming service is not
        available.

Thu Nov 20 00:06:03 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.39, released Thu Nov 20 00:06:03 1997.

Thu Nov 20 00:01:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile: Reordered the files so they are built in
        alphabetic order (within each grouping of targets).  This makes it
        easier to see how the compilation process is doing ;-).

Wed Nov 19 22:59:18 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Minor change to output
        debug statement.

Wed Nov 19 23:01:46 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_operation.cpp: Fixed the problem with
        strings as return values.  Thanks to Mark L Boriack
        <mark@vtcibm4a> for reporting this.

Wed Nov 19 20:48:01 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput_test/server.cpp: Commented out some unreachable
          code at the bottom of main.

Wed Nov 19 19:04:53 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode): Added a cast so that compiler would
        know which operator to call.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svr.cpp (handle_input): Change port
        number received to host byte order.  Minor changes.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Send port number in
        network byte order.

Wed Nov 19 17:45:52 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Put in proper release of
        resources after _narrow operation.

        * tao/stub.h: Used CORBA::String_var as the underlying type for
        'type_id' in STUB_Object.  In the long run this may be a bad idea
        for performance considerations, but we may be able to improve that
        by improving the implementation of String_var.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Removed unreachable ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN.

        * tao/decode.cpp: Made allocation and free semantics of
        'type_hint' consistent with its type of CORBA::String.

Wed Nov 19 17:33:42 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Task_Client.cpp: Fixed error_count.. Thanks to James Hu.

Wed Nov 19 17:20:45 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp: Removed an unreachable return
          statement.  There was already a return above it.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp: Added casts to comparisons of
          char variables to 0, since chars are unsigned by default in
          SGI.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/Task_Client.cpp: Removed a
          couple of unreachable return statements.  There are still
          unreachable statements remaining.  Need help with them.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
          Meaningless type qualifier (const ...) removed.

          Some functions were returning `retval' before it was set.  I had
          these functions return a passed in paramenter instead.

Wed Nov 19 13:50:36 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.38, released Wed Nov 19 13:50:36 1997.

Wed Nov 19 13:11:53 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.cpp (dump_schedule): changed loop
          index from int to u_int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.
          (use_runtime): return 0.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.cpp (debug): changed loop
          index from int to u_int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Wed Nov 19 12:22:50 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Reverted some of the
        minor changes below, specifically the use of ACE_ERROR_RETURN
        rather than ACE_ERROR/return.  ACE_ERROR_RETURN cannot be used
        as-is because the 2nd parameter is used as an 'int' to specify the
        operational status, and the return value of this function is NOT
        an int.  Also had to add a missing semi-colon which caused none of
        the code to compile.

Wed Nov 19 12:07:42 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.37, released Wed Nov 19 12:07:42 1997.

Wed Nov 19 10:37:19 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          The type declared for the rt_info array was wrong.

Wed Nov 19 09:18:30 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.36, released Wed Nov 19 09:18:30 1997.

Wed Nov 19 09:15:15 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Made a bunch of minor
          Changes for resolving the Naming service.

Wed Nov 19 08:44:12 1997  Brian Mendel <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/default.bld:

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/clnt.bld:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svr.bld:  Added build files in the new
          test structure for VxWorks using the GHS compiler.

        * tests/Cubit/Build: Removed the obsolete build directory for vxWorks.

Wed Nov 19 07:47:13 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.35, released Wed Nov 19 07:47:13 1997.

Wed Nov 19 05:53:42 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h: Changed code to add loop
        around all cube calls, and make output more consistent.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/ior_multicast.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/ior_multicast.h: Removed unneeded
        ior_multicast.* source files from the logger example.  It now uses
        the resolve_initial_references() to use the naming service for its
        advertisement.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Makefile (realclean): Updated with realclean & clean
        rules to delete CosNamingS.* and CosNamingC.*

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated status of the naming
        service to working implementation.

        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingS.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingS.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingS.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.h: Removed these files from the
        repository, since the IDL compiler generates these correctly.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/CosNaming_i.cpp (list): Remove
        warning for unused variable.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svr.h: Constructor of event handler
        for multicast doesn't need reply port anymore.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svr.cpp (handle_input): Now receives
        the port number in the multicast request.  Suggested by Doug
        Schmidt.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): changed return value
        variable to be signed.  Added code to send the port number in the
        multicast resolution mechanism as a CORBA::Short.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/NS_CosNaming.cpp (NS_ExtId):
        Reordered initializers in the constructor.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (run): Added a loop around
        all cube calls and added calls/sec stats for them.

        * tao/corba.h: Changed order of inclusion of marshal.i, due to
        warnings of the declaration of the inline function
        make_marshal_object().

        * tao/orbobj.i: reorder the declaration of inline
        CORBA_OBJ::Add_Ref(), to remove a warning.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/svr.cpp (main):
        removed return statement that was causing a warning.

Wed Nov 19 04:22:48 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.34, released Wed Nov 19 04:22:48 1997.

Tue Nov 18 01:29:00 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:  Added Arg_Shifter.cpp into project file.

Tue Nov 18 18:53:57 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_typedef.cpp (gen_code):

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_sequence.cpp (gen_code):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_operation.cpp (gen_code):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_array.cpp (gen_code): Comment out
        unreachable break statements.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_array.cpp (n_dims):

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_predefined_type.cpp (pt):
        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_predefined_type.h (AST_PredefinedType::pt):
        removed const from declarations that it didn't have a meaning for.
        Also from return statements.  These changes were suggested by
        James Hu and the SGI compiler.

Tue Nov 18 18:34:16 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/COOL/client.cpp: ORB_init is now called in
        Task_Client.cpp instead of the main program, to insure that its
        called in the right thread.

        * tests/Cubit/COOL/Task_Client.{h,cpp}: Used the COOL_Activity to
        create threads instead of ACE_Task.

        * tests/Cubit/COOL/server.cpp: Used the createActivity stuff to
        create threads.  The server now creates two servants, one for high
        and the other for low priority clients.

Tue Nov 18 17:44:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added special case for CORBA::WChar to be a
        short on VxWorks/GreenHills.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp: Added template instantiations for SGI.

        * tao/deep_free.cpp (deep_free): Removed unused 'alignment'
        variable.

        * tao/deep_copy.cpp (deep_copy): Removed unused 'alignment'
        variable.

        * tao/encode.cpp (encode): Removed unused 'continue_encoding'
        variable.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (POA_init): Removed options which were no longer
        supported/necessary, as well as their corresponding variables.

Tue Nov 18 17:33:20 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Changed several operations to "oneway" to avoid dead-locks in
          the Event Channel tests.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Runtime_Scheduler.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Runtime_Scheduler.cpp:
          This class is a servant, event though it is only used
          collocated, so it must inherit from the POA class.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          Care must be exercised to create the Runtime_Scheduler instance
          only once the ORB is up and running.

        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.h:

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.h:
          Regenerated all the stubs and skeletons using the latest IDL
          compiler, but still some hand crafting is required, namely for
          operations in base classes.

Tue Nov 18 14:27:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/cdr.cpp (CDR): Changed TAO_PURIFY to ACE_PURIFY.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/serdatever/svr.cpp: Added code to put use a
        kinder, gentler high priority value on VxWorks.  This makes it
        easier for the machine to remain running. :-\

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added CVS id keyword.

        * tao/{corba.h,tao_internals.h,tao_internals.cpp}: Backed out
        tao_internals.h, which is not intended to be publicly visible.
        corba.h should contain only headers/inlines for things which
        should be externally visible.

Tue Nov 18 04:00:46 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.cpp:
          An operation lookup on the dispatching code will cause an error
          message and the CORBA::BAD_OPERATION exception to be raised.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp:
          Somehow the options for setting the Event Service and the
          Scheduling Service IOR were lost. Eventually they must be
          removed, but we are still testing the Naming Service.

Tue Nov 18 02:17:24 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.33, released Tue Nov 18 02:17:24 1997.

Tue Nov 18 02:03:22 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/svr.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp: This test example now uses the
        naming service in the server and client.  Also changed the code to
        have a default use in case the naming service is not available.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Fixed a bug, dealing with
        closing the endpoint of communication for the response of the
        multicast mechanism.

Tue Nov 18 01:37:42 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_operation.cpp,be_state_operation}.cpp: We now
        properly handle the declaration and assigning to the return value.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp: Removed a spurious ()
        appearing after a function call.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_structure,be_union}.cpp: Carlos had removed the
        if !imported check in the member counting function, but it had
        crept in again, maybe due to me. So this is fixed again.

        * test/Cubit/TAO/IDL/svr.cpp: Removed the hack which was
        separating command line arguments starting with O. We leave this
        task to the newly added Arg_Shifter.

        * tao.orbobj.cpp: In ORB_init, the call to
        TAO_ORb_Core_instance->init needed a char ** argv and we were
        passing a char * const* argv. So we cast this. g++ was giving this
        error.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h, TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
        Added 5 new states for code generation. All of these for
        operations and arguments.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_argument.cpp: Made all methods uniform so that the
        state will be set by the corresponding be_operation method. Thus
        the be_operation method will vary the state but still invoke the
        same be_argument method.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_enum.cpp, be_structure.cpp, be_union.cpp, be_field.cpp,
        be_sequence.cpp: Some reformatting, removed unused variables.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_scope.cpp: Changes include adding ACE_ERROR_RETURN
        with file name, line number capability. In addition, we were not
        testing for return status of the various gen methods called.

        * Most important changes in these files:

        TAO_IDL/be/{be_operation,be_state_argument,be_state_operation}.cpp:

        Large scale changes that include a uniform way to invoke methods
        of the be_argument class from the be_operation methods. Added the
        5 new states. Added proper handling of _out parameters in stubs
        and skeletons.

Mon Nov 17 20:05:40 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Cleaned up lots of places
        where the allocated stuff wasn't being deallocated.

        * tao/request.cpp: Insured that the CTOR adds a reference for the
        dynamically-allocated NamedValue.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: Freed the faked service configurator argv.

        * tao/iiopobj.h: Removed anachronistic comments.

        * tao/iiopobj.{i,cpp}: Changed allocation of IIOP::Profile.host to use
        new/delete rather than strdup/free b/c the decoder, which is
        generic, must use new to allocate the space.  Thus, the strdup had
        to go.  Purify now happier.

        * tao/cdr.cpp: Added call to memset bracketed by #if
        defined(TAO_PURIFY) in order to appease the purify gods.

Mon Nov 17 20:05:16 1997  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * arg_shifter.cpp:
        fixed a bug where in new, gcc used the address of an integer
        reference rather than its value. weird.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp:
          Modified the init routine to "consume" command line arguments it
          recognizes by placing them in the rear of argv, and adjusting
          argc. It uses the Arg_Shifter class to accomplish this.

        * tao/arg_shifter.h:
        * tao/arg_shifter.cpp:
          The Arg_Shifter class is an iterator that, as it iterates over
          argv, places consumed arguments at the end of the vector,
          ignored ones in their original order at the beginning of the
          vector, and adjusts argc to hide the consumed arguments.

Mon Nov 17 18:40:49 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.i:
          Some data was not initialized when used from a thread different
          than the one doing ORB_init (even though we choose a global ORB
          in the svc.conf file). Chris found a fix for this. The affected
          methods are reactor(), thr_mgr(), connector() and acceptor().

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          length was not working if the value was <= than the maximum.

        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventCommC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.cpp:
          Fixed the length() problem by hand, even though the new IDL
          compiler should do it right.

Mon Nov 17 11:52:54 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (server_header),
          TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp (be_change_idl_file_extension):
          Updated several methods to ensure const correctness for the
          updated ACE_OS::str*() methods.  Thanks to David Levine for
          reporting this.

Mon Nov 17 02:40:14 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.32, released Mon Nov 17 02:40:14 1997.

Mon Nov 17 01:48:17 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_scope.cpp:
          TypeCode generation was failing for imported members.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_structure.cpp:
          Member count must include all members, imported or not.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
          Added missing decr_indent() in the typecode generation which was
          making the generated code completely unreadable.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Removed the PullConsumer and PullSupplier classes, they are not
          supported.

        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingS.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdminC.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.cpp:
          New version of the generated files, this last version is almost
          making in it, but still needs hand crafting.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
          Fixed buggy TypeCode lenght computation, it was only taking into
          account the tc_encap_len() for the base type but it should use
          the full tc_size().

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Object references *must* be passed a pointer to Object_ptr in
          the marshalling code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_operation.cpp:
          Fixed generated code for Object references as return values. It
          allocates the Object_ptr in the heap, stores the result there
          and creates an Any for it.

Sun Nov 16 23:30:26 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/svr.cpp (main):
        Changed the code to use the resolve_initial_references ()
        interface to get the object refrence to the naming service.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/clnt.cpp (main): Now uses the
        resolve_initial_references() to get the naming service object
        reference, to get the logger factory object reference.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svr.cpp (main):
        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/svr.h:
        Added code to respond to multicast requests for the IOR.

        Added code to respond to multicast requests for the IOR.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Fixed some formatting
        problems dealing with the precision of the output.

Sun Nov 16 14:48:00 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * test/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/{server,client}.dsp: Updated library
          path for release version.

        * TAO_IDL/TAO_IDL.mak:
        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp: Added new files (be_state_*.cpp) into
          project file.

Sun Nov 16 12:56:24 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: The _is_a_skel method's signature
        had an Object_ptr obj parameter which was unused. Instead of
        generating the ACE_UNUSED_ARG (obj) line of code, we use /* obj */
        in the signature.

Sun Nov 16 05:51:38 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.31, released Sun Nov 16 05:51:38 1997.

Sun Nov 16 00:22:04 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
          Fixed output for structs and union test.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp:
          If the user provides no key for an object we generate one, based
          on the object address.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          The length() method should get the maximum if reallocation
          occurs.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp:
        * tao/orbobj.cpp:
        * tao/orbobj.h:
        * tao/params.cpp:
        * tao/params.h:
          Added new options to the ORB (-ORBeventserviceior,
          -ORBscheduleserviceior), this should go away once the Naming
          Service works properly, but are needed now to locate this
          services.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Makefile:
          Added several small classes that help when using the Scheduling
          and/or the Event Service.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Factory.i:
          Encapsulate the construction and configuration of the Scheduling
          Service.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Runtime_Scheduler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Runtime_Scheduler.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Runtime_Scheduler.i:
          Implement a simple, but fast, Scheduling Service based on a
          precomputed scheduling.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Utilities.i:
          Simplify the creation of QoS structures for the Event Service.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Utilities.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Scheduler_Utilities.i:
          Simplify manipulation of the RT_Infos for the Scheduling
          Service.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Channel_Clients.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Channel_Clients_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/lib/Channel_Clients_T.h:
          Helpers to adapt PushSuppliers and PushConsumers.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.h:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerC.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecSchedulerS.cpp:
          This files were generated by the IDL compiler and don't need any
          hand crafting (so far). I still maintain them in CVS because the
          compiler is not stable enough.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/Makefile:
          Removed spurious call to rm.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Removed the (already commented out) include of "orb.idl".

Sat Nov 15 21:38:48 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          The generated length() method will reallocate the sequences
          now.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_constant.cpp:
          It was initializing nested constants in the client header file,
          Andy told me how to fix it.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp:
          Fixed typo in generated code:
          s/_tao_enviroment/_tao_environment/

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_field.cpp:
          Only generate the inline members of the field type if the type
          is not imported.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_fork.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          Removed old code to support plain fork (without ACE).
          Also removed temporary files *unless* we are on Win32, were
          removing the file and keeping it open fails.

        * TAO_IDL/include/idl_global.h:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          Added routines to obtain the generated names of any IDL file,
          not only the one we are processing.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          The compiler now generate all the required include directives
          when the IDL file contains some.

        * tao/params.cpp:
          Initialize name_service_port_ to zero in the constructor.

Sat Nov 15 21:20:01 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_string.cpp: The typecode info was getting
        generated in a wrong file because of setting the worng file to
        generate it in.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp: Some extra indentation was getting
        generated for typecodes. This is fixed.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_argument.cpp: For parameters of type
        ObjRefs, we were not passing the address of the object_ptr to the
        Any constructor. This would have caused seg faults when
        decoding. This is now fixed.

        * TAO_IDL/be: Split be_state.cpp into a number of files based on
        the IDL types, e.g., be_state_struct.cpp, be_state_union.cpp, ...

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp: Name creation now uses a uniform
        strategy rather than typedefed sequences assuming the name of the
        typedef and anonymous sequences getting a generated name. This was
        required to eliminate a number of multiple declarations errors.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state_union.cpp: Since C++ does not allow
        instances of classes to appear inside a union declaration, the
        private data members for data members of type objref, strings,
        sequences, and anys must be pointers. This changes code in the
        accessor methods defined in the generated *.i files for the union.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp: There were some instances of the
        incorrectly spelled _tao_enviroment remaining which have been
        corrected.

        * TAO/tao/managed_types.{h,i,cpp}: Added these 3 files that define
        the self managed data type similar to a String_var. These self
        managed data types are required for struct/union members that are
        strings or obj references, as well as for element types of
        sequences.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp: Added code to generate the typecode
        structure for typedefs. These use the tk_alias kind field.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_union,be_state}.cpp: Improvements to union with
        string members. However, this is still incomplete and will be
        done by the next couple of commits.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp: Removed the ACE_DEBUG
        stmt for printing object keys.

Sat Nov 15 18:03:39 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp (make_cubit): We don't
          need to free up the object key since it's no longer allocated
          dynamically.

        * tao/object: Changed the _get_name() method to return const char
          * to be consistent with the iiopobj change below.

        * tao/iiopobj: Fixed _get_name() so that it doesn't allocate
          memory by having it return const char * and just return the
          pointer.  This should fix some subtle problems.

Sat Nov 15 12:19:55 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: Changed two loop counters from type
          int to type size_t.

Sat Nov 15 01:33:08 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp :
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.h :
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp :
        - Fixed the difference in latency problem from DII and IDL.
        - Changed the DII_Cubit client interface to be similar to IDL, now
        you can specify hostname and port number, instead of the IOR.

        the resource factory faked entry had the proper number of
        arguments specified.

        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/TAO/svc.conf:
        * orbsvcs/bin/Naming_Service/TAO/svr.cpp:
          We will only maintain the TAO version for the naming service, no
          need to keep this subdirectories.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecScheduler.idl:
          The Real Time Scheduling Service. This module declares the QoS
          structures (RT_Info) and the interface for the global scheduler.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Part of the Real Time Event Services interface, this file
          contains the Event type, the basic interfaces for consumers and
          suppliers and some exceptions.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl:
          Part of the Real Time Event Services interface, in particular
          this module defines the event channel, the proxy interfaces and
          the QoS aware subscription and registration interfaces.

        * orbsvcs/lib/Event_Service_Constants.h:
          The Event Service implementation and the Scheduling Service
          implementation require this file, which defines some constants
          and static limits. For lack of a better place I putted it here.

        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNaming.idl:
          Moved the IDL file to the library, otherwise it cannot be used
          by clients.

        * tao/corba.h:
          Added some macros that support portable exception handling,
          either through C++ exceptions or the CORBA::Enviroment
          parameter.

        * orbsvcs/lib/RtecEventCommC.h:

        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingS.i:
        * orbsvcs/lib/CosNamingS.cpp:
          I had to modify the IDL compiler generated files, I will keep
          the files in CVS until we no longer need to modify it.

Fri Nov 14 13:02:52 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp: TAO_Marshal_Objref::decode line 615 which tried
        to set the underlying object_addr was invoking an incorrect inline
        function because of lack of passing an argument to the object_addr
        () method. Specifically, due to the lask of argment, the
        "retrieve" method was getting called whereas we wanted the "set"
        method. All we do is pass a 0 (NUL) argument. This suffices
        because we have already decoded the host and port number. So all
        information is with us to set the server address.

Fri Nov 14 00:29:09 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp: set RCS -ko option so that the Id keyword
          won't get expanded on checkout.  That was causing CVS to think
          that a merge was needed.

Thu Nov 13 19:11:36 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp (start): Updated the code to use the new
          object_addr() style.

        * tao/iiopobj: Added many fixes to the Profile code to fix nasty
          bugs.  Also, renamed {get|set}_object_addr() to simply
          object_addr(), which is the correct style.

        * tao/iiopobj.h: Replaced the use of "localhost" with
           ACE_DEFAULT_SERVER_HOST.  This is necessary to support broken
           platforms like MVS that don't support "localhost"...

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp (parse_args): Assume for
          the moment that any arguments starting with `-O' are `-ORB' or
          `-OA'.  This should be fixed by having the ORB_init() and
          POA_init() methods consume their argv/argc's.

Thu Nov 13 16:18:32 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/orb_core.h:
        * tao/default_client.h:
        * tao/default_server.h:  Changed ACE_SVC_FACTORY_DECLARE to
          ACE_FACTORY_DECLARE.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp:
        * tao/default_client.cpp:
        * tao/default_server.cpp:  Changed ACE_SVC_FACTORY_DEFINE to
          ACE_FACTORY_DEFINE.

        * tao/corba.h: Added include "tao/tao_internals.h".

        * tao/tao_internals.h: Disable header file inclusions.  I've put
          this file into corba.h.

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp: Changed to use "tao/corba.h".

        * tao/TAO.mak:
        * tao/TAO.dsp:  Replaced ACE_BUILD_SVC_DLL with TAO_BUILD_DLL.

        * tao/corba.h: Added TAO_Export definition.

        * tao/*.h:  Replaced ACE_Svc_Export with TAO_Export.  Added
          default definition to build TAO DLL on Win32.

Thu Nov 13 01:47:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp (IIOP_Object): Removed the duplicate CTORs that
        I'd accidentally included here during the prior merge/commit
        phase.

Wed Nov 12 23:59:29 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * TAO/TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp: Changed to generate multithreaded codes
          on NT.

        * TAO/TAO_IDL/be/be_scope.cpp:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/ast_decl.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/idl.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_identifier.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_idlist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_decllist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_exceptlist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_exprlist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_idlist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_labellist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_namelist.h:
        * TAO/TAO_IDL/include/utl_tmpl/utl_strlist.h:  Changed to use
          "ace/stdcpp.h" and removed inclusion of header files that
          conflict with standard C++ library.

Wed Nov 12 18:59:20 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iioporb.cpp: Added call to set object address in Profile.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: Corrected code in the copy CTOR where the host
        was being copied over the old host.  This could prove bad if the
        amount of space allocated previously was too small for the
        hostname we're copying in.  Ideally we'd use something smarter
        than this, but hopefully (if you read the comment below) this will
        go away soon.

        * tao/iiopobj.*: Added an ACE_INET_Addr to IIOP::Profile so that
        we only need to do a gethostbyname() once.  After that we can used
        the cached information.  I'd really like to remove the host/port
        as explicit public data members, but for now we take one step at a
        time.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Use the IIOP::Profile object address when making a
        connection.

        * tao/decode.cpp: Added code to set the object address in the
        Profile when an object ref is decoded.

        * tao/debug.h: Removed old questions in comments.

        * tao/connect.h: Added some documentation.

Wed Nov 12 17:41:02 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: I had forgotten to update the return type of
        _get_name in iiopobj.cpp to "char *" instead of "const char *".

Wed Nov 12 14:28:48 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_union.cpp: Fixed a problem where the front end
        would not give any error if there were duplicate case labels. This
        was happening since an overloaded == operator taking an
        AST_Expression* was not getting called. Instead a simple
        comparison of addresses was taking place. We now use the "compare"
        method defined on the AST_Expression class to fix this problem.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Removed some code under #if 0. The
        noteworthy change, however, has to do with code that gets
        generated for the "_is_a_skel". Some compilers were issuing a
        warning saying "unused argument obj". Since we cannot change the
        signature of the generated "_is_a_skel", we use the trick of
        generatung ACE_UNUSED_ARG (obj); in the code. Some other
        formatting changes made.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp: Some very minor changes so that the
        generated code is properly indented.

        * tao/{iiopobj,object,stub}.h, iiopobj.cpp: Changed the return
        type of _get_name to return a heap-allocated "char *". In the
        earlier case we were erroneously returning a pointer to local
        array. This was a change I made a couple of days back to deal with
        the fact that object keys are octet arrays and are not null
        terminated. Now we take the object key and make a NULL terminated
        copy in a heap allocated string. It is the caller's responsibility
        to free this.

        * tao/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp: Used string_free to
        free the string returned by _get_name.

        * tao/tests/Thruput/client.cpp: _narrow now uses the additional
        env parameter.

Wed Nov 12 09:22:47 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp (open_services): added ACE_UNUSED_ARGs
          for argc and argv if TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: disabled clean and realclean targets on VxWorks,
          so that they don't remove tao_idl from the host build tree.

Tue Nov 11 23:50:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.29, released Tue Nov 11 23:50:06 1997.

Tue Nov 11 20:45:26 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): Replaced NULL with 0.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Fixed the macro for TAO_SYSTEM_EXCEPTION so
          compilers don't whine about extra semi-colons.

        * tao/iioporb.cpp (iiop_string_to_object): Added a cast of (char
          *) 0 to disambiguate one of the methods.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: Moved the constructors and destructors of
          IIOP_Object from the *.i file to the *.cpp file and made them
          non-inline.

Tue Nov 11 18:19:16 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/iiopobj.{h,cpp}: Added two new constructors one of which is
        useful for the _bind call generated by the IDL compiler. This
        constructor takes the host name, port number, and key value
        thereby avoiding the costly string2object call inside the _bind
        method. The second constructor is used to reduce the amount of
        code that gets generated to set a IIOP_Object in the constructor
        of the skeleton class.

        Additionally, these constructors use the REENTRANT get_host_name
        method of the INET_Addr class to retrieve the host name.

        * tao/iiopobj.h,stub.h: Modified the signature of _get_name to
        return a const char*. So users will have to copy this value.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: The method _get_name uses an internal character
        array in which the object key is copied. This is necessary so that
        we can NULL terminate the opaque key and return it to the user.

        * tao/orbconf.h,cdr.h: Commented (and will eventually remove) the
        defintion of MY_BYTE_SEX from cdr.h. Instead, we now use the macro
        TAO_ENCAP_BYTE_ORDER which gets defined in orbconf.h. The files
        affected due to this renaming are:

        tao/{iioporb.cpp, giop.cpp, except.cpp, cdr.cpp, encode.cpp,
        interp.cpp, tc_const.cpp}

        The following files in the IDL compiler source were affected since
        they had to generate TAO_ENCAP_BYTE_ORDER instead of MY_BYTE_SEX.
        TAO_IDL/be/{be_array,be_enum,be_interface,be_sequence,be_structure,
                be_union}.cpp

        * tao/{typecode,decode}.cpp: some reformatting, indentation.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: code generated for _bind uses the
        newly added constructor to class IIOP_Object.

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_interface.be_state}.cpp: Code generated for
        _narrow now takes an additional CORBA::Environment parameter.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit: cubit_i.cpp - in the method
        make_cubit, we make a copy of the string returned by _get_name and
        then free that memory.

        clnt.cpp: The tests for unions have been uncommented. The reason
        they were not working and resulting in seg fault was that methods
        of the cubit interface were being invoked on the factory object.

Tue Nov 11 10:07:04 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile: added missing $ before (VAR)
          in VBIN definition.

        * tao/orbconf.h: added __i386 to TAO_WORDS_BIGENDIAN check,
          because that's what g++/VxWorks uses.  Also added __alpha
          to little endian CPUs.

        * tao/orb_core.i: fixed preprocessor test for using the
          ACE_Hash_Addr<ACE_INET_Addr>::hash_i specialization.

Tue Nov 11 04:22:44 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.28, released Tue Nov 11 04:22:44 1997.

Tue Nov 11 01:16:07 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): Reformatted the
          multicast Name Service locator just a bit.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Started putting a more sane way of automatically
          determining the size of various datatypes into TAO.

Tue Nov 11 00:36:39 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/bin/Logger/ior_multicast.h:
        * orbsvcs/bin/Logger/ior_multicast.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/bin/Logger/clnt.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/bin/Logger/clnt.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/bin/Logger/svr.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/bin/Logger/Makefile:
        Added multicast resolution of the logger service example.

Tue Nov 11 00:36:39 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (resolve_name_service): changed macro for default
        multicast port.
        - Added support for multicast mechanism to resolve the name
        service.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added some definitions for TAO's default
        multicast and reply port, and the default timeout value.

Tue Nov 11 00:00:25 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: removed MUNCHED because
          it's no longer needed for g++/VxWorks.

Mon Nov 10 22:02:42 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/interp.cpp (declare_entry): Moved TAO_ALIGNMENT_MAGIC_NUMBER
          to orbconf.h instead of burying it in interp.cpp.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Rather than trying to guess what the size of
          wchar_t, let's just use what's in ACE.

Mon Nov 10 19:26:03 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h (SIZEOF_INT): FreeBSD and NetBSD have 4 byte
          ints. Thanks to Nanbor for pointing this out.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Added template instantiation for ACE_Atomic_Op.

        * tao/orbconf.h: NetBSD has a long double of size 12, as does
          FreeBSD. Fixed SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE to fix this.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/svr.cpp (main): Removed cerr's
          and replaced them with ACE_ERROR_RETURN's and the like.

Mon Nov 10 01:25:19 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * tao/giop.h: Added ACE_Svc_Export to classes
          (TAO_GIOP_Request_Header, TAO_GIOP_Invocation, TAO_GIOP.)  Some
          of them may not be necessary.

Mon Nov 10 00:09:24 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.27, released Mon Nov 10 00:09:24 1997.

Sun Nov 09 23:43:04 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/corba.h: Reordered the inclusion of poa.i, giop.i,
          iioporb.i, and iiopobj.i

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp (close_services): Fixed typo.

Sun Nov 09 23:32:58 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.26, released Sun Nov 09 23:32:58 1997.

Sun Nov 09 22:04:12 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (ORB_init):
        * tao/tao_internals.cpp (close_services):

          Changed ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex to ACE_SYNCH_RECURSIVE_MUTEX.

Sun Nov  9 16:05:56 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp: *
        tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.h: Added clnt.h and restructured
        the code so it is similar to the IDL_Cubit example.  It doesn't,
        however, have the same options because the DII example uses an ior
        as input.

        * tao/debug.cpp: Added dummy function to get rid of
        "'debug_stream' defined but not used" warning.

Sun Nov  9 13:03:37 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Removed the svc.conf.eg file since it was out of date.

        * tao/svrrqst: Removed the #include for svrrqst.i since we don't
          need any inline functions now.

        * tao/tao_internals: Removed the #include for tao_internals.i
          since we don't need any inline functions now.

        * tao/varout.h: Cleaned up the programming style.

        * tao: Continued to replace all fields with names _foo to foo_.

        * tao/iioporb.cpp: Move the hex routines into ACE since they are
          more general.

        * tao/iioporb.cpp: Removed the inclusion of iioporb.i since it is
          already included in corba.h.

        * tao: Replaced all uses of ACE_Thread_Mutex with ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX
          since this is portable...

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: Removed the inclusion of iiopobj.i since it is
          already included in corba.h.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Moved several large inlined methods into the *.cpp
          file.

        * tao/giop: Removed the enormous (and unused) incoming_message()
          method.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Removed the inclusion of giop.i since that is
          handled in corba.h.

        * tao: Removed the factories.i and factories.cpp files since they
          don't seem to be used by anything.

        * tao/{corbacom,except}.*: Changed SYSEX to the more politically
          correct TAO_SYSTEM_EXCEPTION.

        * tao: Replaced all uses of wslen() and wscpy() with the
          corresponding ACE_OS wide string functions.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Removed all the HAVE_WIDEC_H stuff.  This should
          be handed by ACE.

        * tao/connect.i: Removed the template instantiations since they
          were commented out and didn't appear to be used.

        * tao/connect.cpp: connect.i was already being included in corba.h,
          so don't include it again.

        * tao/client_factory.cpp: Moved inlined constructor/destructor
          from the *.i file into the *.cpp file.

        * tao/cdr.cpp (CDR): Moved a bunch of absurdly long inlined methods
          from the *.i file into the *.cpp file.

        * tao/any.cpp (CORBA_Any): refcount_ has previously been
          uninitialized.  I gave it a value of 1.

        * tao/any.cpp (CORBA_Any): Moved the initialization into the
          base/member section, where it belongs.

        * tao/any.h: Corrected a spelling mistake in an enumeral and
          upper-cased the minor codes for exceptional returns.  Are these
          actually used anywhere?

        * tao: Removed all the unnecessary #if 0 ... #endif header files.
          I don't know why there were still there.

        * tao/except.h: Moved the #ifdef for minor and major into
          orbconf.h, where they belong.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Removed all the DECLARED_* macros since they
          no longer made sense once we've got ACE.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Moved the TAO_DEFAULT* macros from ace/OS.h
          here, which is more where they belong.

        * tao/default_server.cpp (TAO_Default_Server_Strategy_Factory):

        * tao/{debug.h,orbconf.h}: Removed the DECLARED_STRERROR macro
          since ACE handles this.

Sun Nov 09 10:18:06 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/connect.cpp: fixed RCS keyword (Id instead of id).

Sat Nov 08 23:23:41 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.25, released Sat Nov 08 23:23:41 1997.

Sat Nov  8 21:27:34 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (init): Removed the code that always binded us
          to our hostname.  This is unnecessary and makes it hard to use
          other interfaces on the same host (such as localhost or some ATM
          interface, etc.).  With this change (and the corresponding
          changes to ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_name()), we can now bind to
          INADDR_ANY.

        * docs/releasenotes: Added Marina's documentation for the Trader
          and cleaned up all the other entries to make them consistent.

        * tao: Changed ProfileBody to Profile, TaggedProfile to
          Tagged_Profile, ProfileSeq to Profile_Sequence, and ProfileId to
          Profile_ID.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp (ProfileBody): For some god knows why reason,
          the CORBA::String and CORBA::UShort parameters to ProfileBody
          where being passed as references.  This is silly, so I changed
          them to non-references.

        * tao/connect.cpp (open),
          tao/poa.cpp (create): Replaced a use of
          ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_name(void) with
          ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_name (char *, size_t), which is
          reentrant.

        * tao/Makefile: Removed the DCFLAGS, OCFLAGS, and the TAO_ORB_CORE
          target macros from the Makefile since they were unnecessary.
          Thanks to Arturo for reporting this.

        * tao/except.cpp (print_exception): Fixed a strange format code in
          print_exception that was causing a seg fault.  What the heck
          does %#lx mean?  Thanks to Mark L Boriack <mark@vtcibm4a> for
          reporting this.

Fri Nov 07 21:23:35 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/orb_core.h:
        * tao/marshal.h:
        * tao/corbacom.h:
          Added ACE_Svc_Export to some classes.

        * tao/any.cpp:
          Removed delete after DEEP_FREE call, it crashes on NT and it
          should be unneeded.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp (gen_code):
          When generating arguments for the server header don't use nested
          types. The fully qualified type name is needed, even on NT.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:
          Added code to generate a default constructor.

Fri Nov 07 17:26:49 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/{client,server}.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/{client,server}.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/client.dsp:  Removed
          ACE_HAS_TSS_ORB_CORE flag.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/client.cpp (main): Added a
          return statement to satisfy MSVC.

Fri Nov  7 18:20:46 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/{client,server}/svc.conf: Updated to
        reflect the proper combination of options to achieve the
        thread-per-ORB-per-rate concurrency model.

        * docs/components.html: Updated to refer to seminal documentation
        referred to below.

        * docs/configurations.html: Started some new documentation.  It's
        got a ways to go right now. :-)

Fri Nov 07 15:42:45 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): check for 0 argv[curarg]
          before calling strcmp on it.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: added MUNCHED for
          VxWorks/g++.

Fri Nov  7 10:30:59 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp (fake_service_entries_i): Updated faked
        service entries to include new Resource Factory.  This is the
        fallback for VxWorks.

        * tao/orb_core.h (TAO_Resource_Factory): Added much comments.

Fri Nov 07 02:45:56 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.24, released Fri Nov 07 02:45:56 1997.

Fri Nov  7 01:58:30 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@coyote.wolfpack.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_fork.cpp: Added the (__FreeBSD__) flag to
          correctly include wait.h file.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: Replaced ACE_NETBSD with ACE_HAS_THREADS in
          template instantiation segment.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added the (__FreeBSD__) flag to exclude inclusion of
          widec.h.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (Release): Wrapped ACE_GUARD with ACE_MT macro.

Fri Nov 07 01:46:04 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/(cubitC.cpp, cubit.cpp): Byte order
          changed from 1 to MY_BYTE_SEX.

Thu Nov  6 23:59:45 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/params.cpp: Moved all the inlined methods out of the header
          file and put them in the *.cpp file.  I hope this doesn't cause
          problems for GCC on VxWorks.

        * tests/Thruput_test/client.cpp: Fixed a mistake with how
          the long string constant was defined.  The scheme being
          used wasn't portable.

Thu Nov 06 20:58:52 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/connect.cpp: Made sure that TAO_Server_Connection_Handler
          and TAO_Client_Connection_Handler have a zero Reactor pointer.
          If this is not the case, they will try to deregister from a
          sometimes non-existent Reactor.

Thu Nov  6 19:06:59 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated status of Naming Service
        port to TAO.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp (gen_client_header):
        removed warning for unused variable.

Thu Nov  6 17:07:58 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_internals.i: Added missing #include file.

        * tao/tao_internals.i: Change lock used as monitor for service
        count to use ACE_Static_Object_Lock::instance().  This pleases
        VxWorks (but makes me nauseous).

        * tao/tao_internals.h: Removed static instances of locks to please
        VxWorks.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (ORB_init): Changed lock used for the monitor
        here to be ACE_Static_Object_Lock::instance().  This pleases
        VxWorks (but makes me nauseous).

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (init): Merged in changes for new Naming
        Service-related options that got accidentally overwritten last
        night.

        * docs/Options.html: Added documentation for new Naming
        Service-related options in.

        * tao/orbobj.h: Added documentation for a few static methods.

        * tao/params.h: Changed LOCAL_INLINE macro to TAO_LOCAL_INLINE to
        avoid possible collisions with application macros.

Thu Nov  6 14:51:22 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: Renamed libutil to libtao_idl_util. libutil is
        a system library on NetBSD. Updated TAO_IDL/util/Makefile to be
        compatible with this.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (server_header): Changed ::toupper to
        be toupper, since toupper is a macro on some platforms (like
        netbsd).

        * TAO_IDL/driver/{drv_preproc.cpp, drv_fork.cpp}: NetBSD has
        sys/wait.h, instead of wait.h. Added #define to fix it.

Thu Nov  6 01:40:29 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_internals.h: #defined ACE_Thread_Mutex to be
        ACE_Null_Mutex for NetBSD.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added NetBSD to the #define around HAVE_WIDEC_H.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: #defined around some thread-specific template
        instantiations which are not needed on NetBSD.

        * tao/except.h: Undefined "minor" and "major, since these are
        defined in NetBSD.

Thu Nov 06 14:47:15 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/params.[hi]: inlined some functions in the class declaration
          because g++ for VxWorks couldn't deal with them in the .i file.

        * tao/tao_internals.*,orbobj.cpp: fixed replacement of orbinit_lock_
          and service_lock_ with ACE_Static_Object_Lock::instance ().

Thu Nov 06 02:17:02 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.23, released Thu Nov 06 02:17:02 1997.

Wed Nov  5 23:44:42 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{orbobj,iioporb}.h: Made the first parameter to
          string_to_object() a const CORBA::String rather than just a
          CORBA::String.

        * tao/params (addr): Fixed a bug where we should have been using
          const ACE_INET_Addr & rather than just ACE_INET_Addr &.

        * tao/orbobj: Began adding the hooks for a multicast-based
          implementation of resolve_initial_references().

        * tao/params: Added a new set/get interface to optionally set/get
          the IOR of the configured Naming Service.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (init): Added a -ORBnameservice command-line
          option.  If this option is given, it indicates the IOR where the
          Naming Service resides.

        * tao/params: Changed the signature of TAO_ORB_Parameters::addr()
          to return a const ACE_INET_Addr & rather than an ACE_INET_Addr.

        * tao/params: Added new get/set name_service_port() methods to
          get/set the name service multicast port.

Wed Nov  5 22:38:08 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput_test/client.cpp (main):
        * tests/Thruput_test/server.cpp (main): Fixed missing declarations
        and unused variables and labels.  Fixed uninitialized and unused
        variables.

        * tests/Thruput_test/ttcp_i.cpp (ttcp_sequence_i):
        * tests/Thruput_test/ttcp_i.h (class ttcp_sequence_i): Change to
        use POA.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/README (server): Changed comment on
        how to start the server to indicate the use of "-d" to see the
        IOR.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (Cubit_Client): Reordered
        member initializers to match declaration order

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/svr.cpp (main): Fixed comparison of
        ">=" on an unsigned variable to compare only ">".

Wed Nov 05 20:35:52 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (fini): Close down the connector. Other
        ORB_Core specific objects also need to be cleaned up (and
        deleted).

        * tests: Made sure that the orb pointer returned by ORB::init() is
        correctly freed up.  Following files were updated:

          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/svr.cpp
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/Task_Client.cpp
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/svr.cpp
          TAO/tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/base_server/server.cpp

Wed Nov  5 19:37:25 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL compiler:

        files be_array.cpp, be_interface.cpp, be_sequence.cpp,
        be_structure.cpp, be_union.cpp, be_enum.cpp - Added MY_BYTE_SEX to
        the typecode generation methods.

        be_operation.cpp, be_argument.cpp, be_state.cpp, be_codegen.* -
        Modified to deal with _out parameters that are passed to the
        actual upcalls in the server-side skeleton.

        Some minor changes involving removing commented-out code in the
        constructors of some classes.

        * tests/Thruput_test: Some modifications. Still needs more work
        get it to run.

Wed Nov 05 19:26:44 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/IDL_Cubit.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/client.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/server.dsp:
        * tao/TAO.dsp: Renamed debeg version of TAO library to TAO.dll for
          NT.

Wed Nov 05 13:39:19 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: more hacks to not build the IDL compiler
          on VxWorks.

Wed Nov 05 12:53:53 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/interp.cpp:

          - Win32 does not use "fixed" byte alignment.  Fixed the
            setup_entry macro to take this into account.

          - (declare_entry) Seperated the declaration of the structs from
            their use.  This is necessary for the VC++4.2 compiler.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/svr.cpp (main): Commented out debug
          message, since obj is not declared.

Wed Nov 05 01:41:34 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.22, released Wed Nov 05 01:41:34 1997.

Wed Nov  5 00:48:58 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput_test/utils.cpp: Delete static definitions of
        functions.

        * tests/Thruput_test/ttcpS.cpp:
        * tests/Thruput_test/ttcpC.cpp (_duplicate):
        * tests/Thruput_test/client.cpp (main):
        * tests/Thruput_test/ttcp_i.cpp (sendStructSeq):
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/svr.cpp: Removed a couple of warnings
        of unused and uninitialized variables.  Included "ace/ACE.h" to
        be able to have the _REENTRANT flag.

Wed Nov  5 00:18:17 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp: Added code to generate the missing
        operator [] for sequences.

Tue Nov  4 23:38:54 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/{server,client}/Makefile: Removed the
        (evil) TAO_HAS_TSS_ORB_CORE flag. Now this functionality is
        provided by svc.conf.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/: Fixed the server code to use the new
        IDL compiler generated code.

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/Task_Client.cpp: Changed the
        order of the initializers to remove g++ warnings, and added some
        ACE_UNUSED_ARGs. Also removed the hand-crafted stubs, to make way
        for the idl-compiler generated files.

Tue Nov  4 23:21:29 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp (main):
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (run): Changed the format of the
        output to be more readable.  Also, fixed resolution of the time for
        the cube_struct_dii() call.

Tue Nov  4 21:12:48 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/except.h: Removed print_exception().  It seems unnecessary
        and pollutes the global namespace.

Tue Nov  4 16:58:12 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * {tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit,tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit,
        tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit,tests/Demux_Test,
        tests/Thruput_test}/Makefile: Added an explicit definition for
        VBIN so that VxWorks can build properly.

        * tao/orb_core.*: Modified TAO_Resource_Factory so that it divides
        the information that it tracks between pre-allocated resources and
        resources which are allocated by the application.  Specifically,
        the orb and root poa pointers are in here (though it's possible
        that when we move to a full POA implementation that the root poa
        can be pre-allocated as well).  These pointers are initialized to
        zero and are given values by the TAO_ORB_Core instance writing
        through back to the TAO_Resource_Factory instance.

        Also, this implementation reduced the number of singletons/TSS
        singletons utilized by the resource factory.  The initial
        "get-it-working" cut used a singleton/tss singleton pair for every
        resource, which was quite wasteful in environments such as NT that
        don't have many TSS slots available.  Perhaps if we get even more
        clever this can be reduced even further.

        * tao/except.*: Added print_exception() function for backwards
        compatibility.  It simply calls
        CORBA::Environment::print_exception().

Tue Nov 04 10:45:07 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp: Enclosed a #pragma ident with #if !defined
          ACE_WIN32.  Compilers other than SunCC might also need this.

Tue Nov  4 13:47:26 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit: Modified the Makefiles in the
        client and server directory so that they use the TAO IDL
        compiler. Also added the clean and realclean targets. Updated the
        server side cubit.idl because it was different from what the
        client was using.

        * TAO_IDL compiler: Fixed the following problems

        (1) Removed the extra call to Release in the generated _narrow
        method  in be_interface.cpp

        (2) Used ACE_CORBA_1 (Object) instead of CORBA::Object in the
        class declaration for interfaces - in be_interface.cpp

        (3) be_interface_fwd.cpp - var_impl had to be updated to generate
        code that uses the ptr () method in the calls to _duplicate

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit: Fixed some outstanding issues and
        made sure that it works. Updated the README file.

Tue Nov 04 09:48:51 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.i: disabled the ACE_Hash_Addr<ACE_INET_Addr>::hash_i ()
          template specialization on g++/VxWorks because g++
          cygnus-2.7.2-960126 can't handle it.

        * tao/except.h (line 118): removed backslash at end of comment line.
          Some compilers complain about that.

        * tao/except.cpp (CORBA_SystemException): reordered initializers to
          match declaration order.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: don't build the IDL compiler on VxWorks.

Tue Nov 04 06:26:14 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp:
          It still generated fully qualified names for some sequences,
          that will not work on NT.

Tue Nov 04 05:32:44 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.21, released Tue Nov 04 05:32:44 1997.

Tue Nov  4 04:42:17 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput_test/server.cpp:
        * tests/Thruput_test/client.cpp:
        * tests/Thruput_test/ttcpS.cpp:
        Fixed "print_exception" errors and errors due to some changes in
        the orb compiler.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/svr.cpp (svc): Use unsigned
        int for variable that is used for positive comparisons only.

Tue Nov 04 01:00:51 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/IDL_Cubit.dsw: Renamed former test.dsw
          to IDL_Cubit.dsw.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/{client,server}.dsp: Renamed
          executables for debug version to client.exe and server.exe on
          NT.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsw: Renamed former test.dsw
          to DII_Cubit.dsw.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/{client,server}.dsp: Renamed
          executables for debug version to client.exe and server.exe on
          NT.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit.mak: Added cubit.idl into
          makefile and its custom build settings.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/MT_Cubit.dsw: Renamed former
          MTCubit.dsw to MT_Cubit.dsw.

Mon Nov 03 23:16:06 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (coerce_value): Added an explicit
          cast (float) to avoid NT warnging messages.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/svr.cpp (svc): Removed
          declaration of function print_exception.  It's now a member
          function of CORBA_Environment.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp: Commented out include <values.h>.  This
          was causing compilation errors on NT.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/svr.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/clnt.cpp: Changed to use the new
          CORBA_Environment::print_exception.

        * tao/except.h (CORBA_Environment):  Added ACE_Svc_Export to this
          class.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/MTCubit.dsw:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client/client.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server/server.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/test.dsw:  Added new workspace and
          project files.

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp:  Moved the output executables to the usual
          place.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be.h: Added #ifdef'ed pragma to diable warning 4250
          on NT.  This is only temporary and should be fixed later.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp (gen_var_defn):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_structure.cpp (gen_var_defn):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp (gen_var_defn): Removed unused local
          variables declaration (s).

Mon Nov  3 23:25:30 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL Compiler: Files be_sequence.cpp, be_typedef.cpp,
        be_state.cpp: Lots of improvements to get sequences to
        work. Support for sequences of strings or obj references is
        limited. But for all other cases, this seems to be working fine.

        There were some unnecessary lines of code in be_state.cpp that
        were giving rise to multiple declarations errors. These are
        removed.

Mon Nov  3 18:30:09 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (main): compare with
        "!= 0" rather than "== -1" for errors.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl (enum discrim): Deleted
        enumerations not used.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp (please_exit): Fixed
        unused variable.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h (Cubit_Factory_i):
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h (objrefs): Fixed invalid
        comparison between a signed and unsigned variable.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp (main): Fixed comparison of
        ">=" on an unsigned variable to compare only ">".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp (gen_client_stubs): Removed unused
        variable warning.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp (yytoks): Added brackets to the array
         of structures being initialized.

Mon Nov 03 18:43:37 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp:
          "Fixed" skeleton generation code. Sometimes the formal parameter
          names for the skeleton can clash with the user defined names for
          the (IDL) method parameter names.
          To minimize the chances of such a problem I choose very long
          parameter names for the skeleton (things like <_tao_enviroment>
          instead of just <env>), but the right solution is to ignore the
          user defined parameter names and generate them using some
          numbering scheme.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_predefined_type.cpp:
          Generate CORBA::_tc_Object as the TypeCode for all pseudo
          object, this is a hack but works for the files we are using
          right now (maybe it will fail for complex things, like the
          interface repository).

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          Fixed a number of minor problems:
          Missing _ptr type for sequences.
          The return type for T_var::operator-> was different in the
          .h and .i file.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp:
          tc_name_ and type_name_ were not initialized, producing some
          segfaults under NT.

Mon Nov  3 13:45:54 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * {tao,TAO_IDL/util,TAO_IDL/narrow,TAO_IDL/fe,TAO_IDL/driver,
        TAO_IDL/be,TAO_IDL/ast,Benchmark/benchmark}/Makefile (SHLIB):
        Fixed definition so that the extension was $(SOEXT) rather than
        hard-coded to "so".  This makes things compile on VxWorks better.
        Thanks to David Levine for pointing this out.

Sun Nov 02 19:42:08 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.20, released Sun Nov 02 19:42:08 1997.

Sun Nov  2 19:20:57 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/except.*: Made the "print_exception" utility function
        as a method of class Environment.

        * TAO/tao/giop.cpp: In the TAO_GIOP_Invocation::start method, we
        were previously not returning even if the connection establishment
        phase was failing. A return statement is inserted. However, there
        still are problems when the GIOP_Invocation variable called "call"
        goes out of scope.

        * TAO_IDL Compiler: be_interface.cpp - The _bind call now
        generates a "char IOR" instead of "static char IOR" since the
        latter will be problematic with multiple threads. Thanks to
        Arturo Montes <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for pointing that out.

        * TAO/test/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit : Improved the code so that it uses
        the "print_exception" which is now defined on class
        CORBA::Environment. The clnt still needs improvement in terms of
        handling invalid parameters and gracefully exiting.

        * IDL_Compiler: The bug resulting out of encoding object
        references has been fixed atleast on Solaris using g++ as well as
        SunCC. Changes made to be_operation.cpp and be_state.cpp such that
        the return value for object references is always of type
        CORBA::Object_ptr rather than the real interface type. In
        addition, keeping in perspective the change that Irfan made and
        described below (in encode.cpp), the Any that holds the result
        *does not* own the value. In contrast, for the rest of the cases
        the result (of type Any) owns the result.

        * be_sequence.cpp: Additional work in progress. Full changelog
        entry will be available in the next commit.

Fri Oct 31 22:20:06 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/encode.cpp (encode): Changed cast of data from
          *(CORBA::Object_ptr *) to (CORBA::Object_ptr).

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): Manipulation of curarg was
          all messed up.  Fixed it such that it was not incremented
          unnecessarily.

Fri Oct 31 13:46:04 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Updated to specify new TAO_Resource_Factory
        service and its options.

        * docs/releasenotes/orbcore.html: Updated to reflect recent work.

        * tao/orb_core.*: Added the acceptor and related members and
        methods from CORBA_ORB.  Made TAO_Resource_Factory a Service
        Object so that it can be loaded via the Service Configurator.  The
        option to change its resources between global and thread-specific
        is "-ORBresources global" and "-ORBresources tss", respectively.

        * tao/orbobj.*: Moved the acceptor and related members and methods
        to TAO_ORB_Core.

        * tests/.../svc.conf: Added Resource Factory as a service.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/{DII_Cubit,MT_Cubit}/cubitS.cpp,
        tests/Thruput_test/ttcpS.cpp, tao/poa.cpp: Changed acceses that
        used to go to CORBA_ORB::params() to go to TAO_ORB_Core::params().

Fri Oct 31 08:39:54 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL Compiler - Intermediate commit of all improved features.

        * be/be_type.* : Improved the nested_type_name method such that it
        now takes an additional parameter called suffix that has a default
        value of NULL. Carlos, Sergio, and myself independently found an
        extremely bad piece of code that was getting generated that looked
        like the following:
                ACE_NESTED_CLASS (XXXX, YYYY)_ptr

        The new convention is to pass the suffix such as "_ptr", or "_var"
        or "_out" to this method so that it can generate valid code of the
        form:
                ACE_NESTED_CLASS (XXXX, YYYY_ptr)

        * be/be_decl.cpp : All the methods such as repoID (), flatname
        (), etc now check if the corresponding data member was created or
        not. If they are not, the corresponding private method e.g.,
        compute_repoID (), are invoked. This way we do not have to call
        all these private methods in the constructors of all the derived
        be classes. The one compelling reason to do it this way is because
        the "names" for certain types are not available at construction
        time, e.g., sequences. A name to a sequence is assigned from the
        context it is in i.e., whether it was a named sequence in the form
        of a "typedef" statement or it was an anonymous sequence.

        As of this commit, all calls to such compute_*  methods in the
        constructors of all the derived be classes are commented out and
        will eventually disappear in the next commit.

        * be/be_decl.cpp : One more change in be_decl.cpp is to add the
        case for "interface_fwd" in the generation of the _var and _out
        definitions and implementations.

        * be/be_helper.* : Added two new methods called "gen_ifdef_macro"
        and "gen_endif". These are required to generate the #if !defined
        (...) <code> #endif macros. These are very essential if the IDL
        has forward declarations of interfaces. Forward declarations of
        interfaces must generate a forward class declaration. In addition,
        it has to typedef the "_ptr" type and define the "_var" and "_out"
        types. However, the real "be_interface" class does this too which
        can result in "multiple declarations" errors from the C++
        compiler. Hence we use this scheme. As in the case of the
        nested_type_name method mentioned above, this method also takes a
        default "suffix" parameter (= 0). This is required for the "_var",
        "_ptr", and "_out" suffixes.

        * be/be_interface.cpp
          be/be_interface_fwd.cpp:

        Used the TAO_OutStream::gen_ifdef_macro () and gen_endif methods
        for the definitions of the _ptr, _var, and _out classes and their
        implementations.

        *be/be_sequence.* : Lot of modifications and change in the design
        in terms of handling the base types that themselves could be
        sequences. Although the AST_Sequence i.e., OMG IDL does not define
        a "sequence" to be a scope producing construct like structs or
        unions, we choose to make "be_sequence" to be a scope producing
        construct. This is no way alters the OMG IDL language because the
        front-end is still the same. "be_sequence" was made to inherit
        from scope because the sequence mapping gives rise to a C++ class
        which is a scoping construct. This way, base types that turn out
        to be anonymous sequences can be assigned a parent scope and their
        name generation will fall in line with other classes.

        There are certain features missing with sequences at this commit
        time, but this should reduce tweaking the generated code to a
        large extent.

        * be/be_state.cpp: Update the code for handling sequences and
        typedefs. Typedefs should be handled properly now.

        * All other *.cpp files: Either commented out the compute_* calls
        in the constructors or removed them.

Fri Oct 31 03:00:09 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orb_core.cpp: Moved call to connector's open() into init(),
        thus insuring that it gets called only AFTER all the resources are
        available from the Resource Factory.

        * tao/orb_core.*: Changed data members to be associations rather
        than containment.  This allows decoupling of the
        "thread-specificness" of these resources from the
        thread-specificness of the general TAO_ORB_Core container.  Also
        added set accessors for those resources.

        Added TAO_Resource_Factory class from which the TAO_ORB_Core
        container initializes itself.  For now this remains a singleton
        which is, at compile-time, determined to be either TSS or not.
        But, soon, it will be loaded via the Service Configurator and its
        TSS nature determined at runtime.

        * tao/giop.h: Updated to use the new ACE macro
        ACE_CLASS_IS_NAMESPACE.

        * tao/default_server.*: Implemented the new open() method so that
        it initializes the Reactive and Threaded strategies from the
        information in TAO_ORB_Core.

        * tao/server_factory.*: Added open() method to be called after all
        ORB resources are loaded up.  This method can then be used by a
        strategy factory to further initialize its contained strategies if
        they require handles to resources to which the ORB might legislate
        access.  The default implementation does nothing.

Fri Oct 31 01:03:05 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp (main): obj was not declared.
          Commented out use of obj in dmsg1.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp (Cubit_Factory_i):
          numobjs_ was used before it was assigned.

        * TAO/TAO_IDL/TAO_IDL.{mak,mdp}: Added VC++4.2 make files.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (dump): Streaming the enum was
          ambiguous.  Therefore the enum was cast to an int.

Thu Oct 30 22:50:44 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * tao/corba.h:
          Added a definition for ACE_NESTED_CLASS, maybe it is defined in
          some place else, but I couldn't find it.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          Fixed the definition for skeleton destructors.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
          Added a lot of redundant ACE_OS::fflush() calls. Apparently we
          have two FILE* or file descriptors over the same file, bt the
          fflush hides the problem.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp:
          Fixed inconsistency between operator-> declaration and
          definition for _out classes.

Thu Oct 30 14:06:54 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/Makefile:
        Added an expression to the sed command in the rule to construct
        lex.yy.cpp, that replaces ECHO with TAO_ECHO, because a
        different ECHO macro is already defined in
        /usr/include/sys/termios.h

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        Fixed some warnings about nested comments.
        Changed the declaration of variable i to outside of
        the 'for' initialization to avoid obsolete binding warnings.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface_fwd.cpp (gen_client_header):
        Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unused variable warning,
        for variable i.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_constant.cpp (exprtype_to_string):
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_error.cpp (exprtype_to_string):
        Added case statements to handle the rest of un-handled
        enumerations from AST_Expression::ExprType.  These will
        handle a default value (i.e. NULL).  Enumerations added are:
        AST_Expression::EV_wstring
        AST_Expression::EV_wchar
        AST_Expression::EV_longdouble
        AST_Expression::EV_ulonglong
        AST_Expression::EV_longlong

Thu Oct 30 09:56:41 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.h: Added comments to TAO_GIOP class explicitly pointing
        out its use as a namespace.  Concurrently, I also scoped the CTOR,
        Copy CTOR, and DTOR as 'private' so nobody can mistakenly
        instantiate one of these puppies.

Thu Oct 30 03:40:26 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/server.dsp:  Updated include files
          path and libarary path.

        * tao/giop.cpp (close_connection): Use ACE_HANDLE instead of int.

Thu Oct 30 02:53:20 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.19, released Thu Oct 30 02:53:20 1997.

Thu Oct 30 02:20:21 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Cubit:
        Added more comments and changed the header to be ACE'ified.
        Make output more consistent.

Thu Oct 30 02:12:27 1997 Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/{TAO, Cubit}: Changed the directory heirarchy to the
        following: tests/Cubit/TAO/ now contains all the Cubit examples,
        i.e. IDL_Cubit, MT_Cubit and DII_Cubit, instead of tests/. Updated
        the README and Makefiles to reflect this. DII_Cubit is the
        handcrafted "original" Cubit example.

        * tests/Cubit/COOL: Added the COOL version of the Cubit test. The
        COOL version is written for Chorus COOL version 4.1.

Wed Oct 29 22:26:10 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (init): Fixed the error handling so we
        exit correctly when things go wrong.

        * tao/connect.cpp (open): Revised the code to use the new
        ACE_LACKS_SOCKET_BUFSIZ to detect when this feature isn't
        supported.

        * tao/{giop,connect}: Added a nifty typedef called TAO_SVC_HANDLER
        to remove the drudgery of expanding the template each time.

        * tao: Changed the name of TAO_OA_Connection_Handler to
        TAO_Server_Connection_Handler to be compliant with the
        TAO_Client_Connection_Handler.

Wed Oct 29 20:47:47 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp:
        * tests/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h:
        Cleaned up the code.  Added ACE_Profile_Timer to time the calls.
        Changed copyright header.  Added more comments.

Wed Oct 29 18:55:57 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop: Added "_"'s to the data members in
        TAO_GIOP_Invocation.

        * tao/giop (send_request): Swaped the order of the parameters for
        send_request() so that it would be consistent with recv_request.

        * tao/{connect,giop}: Changed read_message() to recv_request(),
        and send_message() to send_request() since these things really
        work on GIOP requests.

        * tao/{connect,giop}: Changed read_message() to recv_message(),
        which is more like other parts of ACE.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Fixed the calls to read_message() and
        send_message() so that they don't try to modify "this."

        * tao/giop: Changed the send_message() and read_message() in the
        TAO_GIOP class to take ACE_Svc_Handler<ACE_SOCK_STREAM,
        ACE_NULL_SYNCH> rather than TAO_Client_Connection_Handler.

Wed Oct 29 17:53:12 1997    <irfan@CHA-CHA>

        * tao: Added TAO_HAS_TSS_ORB_CORE to tao and Cubit NT makefiles.
          This probably needs to be added to the other NT makefiles.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svc.conf: Updated files to pass the correct
          options to the factory.

Wed Oct 29 16:07:20 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.*: Changed most methods that took ACE_SOCK_Stream&
        parameters to take TAO_Client_Connection_Handler*& parameters.
        This makes it easier to clean up properly after errors.  Also
        #ifdef'd out seemingly unused code (TAO_GIOP::incoming_message).
        Fixed call to ACE_Svc_Handler::idle() to not contain an argument.

        * docs/Options.html: Updated the documentation to reflect recent
        changes.

Wed Oct 29 15:59:30 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp: OO'ified the code. Added class
        Cubit_Client.
        * tests/IDL_Cubit/clnt.h: added this file to contain  the class
        definition.

Wed Oct 29 11:01:11 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL compiler: be_type.cpp::nested_type_name: A quick commit
        made that includes an improvement over the previous scheme of
        generating ACE_NESTED_CLASS macros. We handle the problem of
        generating fully scoped names for types that were defined in some
        ancestor of the scope in which that type is being used.

        * Makefiles under TAO_IDL: Fixed a bug in the Makefiles under all
        the subdirectories. This bug was reported by "ARTURO MONTES"
        <mitosys@colomsat.net.co>. The bug was causing circular
        dependencies on the libraru that was getting compiled.

Wed Oct 29 06:17:36 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): Must increase the loop
          counter.

Wed Oct 29 02:11:43 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.18, released Wed Oct 29 02:11:43 1997.

Wed Oct 29 00:56:26 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svc.conf: Updated documentation comments to
        reflect factory option changes.

        * tao/orbobj.*: Wiped argvec_shift and all its bugs off the face
        of the earth.  Manojkumar Acharya <cvsf325.gpt.co.uk> should prove
        to be very happy about this turn of events. :-)

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Weeded out old, dead code here and there and
        migrated much of what had been in ORB_init() into
        TAO_ORB_Core::init().

        * tao/orb_core.*: Added methods init() and fini() which perform
        ORB Core-related initializations and cleanups, respectively.  This
        is all in anticipation of having a Unified Factory which provides
        ORB Core as well as other information.  Also began stubbing out
        and migrating various data members and associated accessors so
        that they are pointers rather than actual members.  The next step
        is to actually make them pointers and have everything get
        initialized properly and deterministically and keep everything
        working.

        * tao/{giop,orb_core}.cpp: Revised code due to recent changes in
        ACE related to the Caching connector.

        * tao/default_server.{h,cpp} (parse_args): This method now uses
        options of the style -ORBfoo rather than the previously-cryptic
        single-letter options.  This should allow us to eventually allow
        this same routine to parse args from the command line as well as
        inside the svc.conf file.  The price we pay for consistency,
        however, is verbosity to the point of insanity (e.g.,
        -ORBconcurrency...blech!)  These options are briefly documented in
        the method header as well as in subsequent svc.conf files.

        * tao/decode.cpp: Added some comments for arguments.

        * tao/connect.{h,cpp}: Moved Connector-related typedefs and
        corresponding template instantiations into the proper
        file--orb_core.*.

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (init): Moved much of what used to be
        ORB_init() into here.  Changed the manner in which objref style
        was determined--it's no longer via a special ORB name but rather
        by the -ORBobjrefstyle option which can have either the value
        "IOR" or "URL" (default is URL).

Tue Oct 28 21:15:36 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * build/SunOS5.5/TAO/tests/IDL_Cubit/clnt.cpp (main): Fixed the
        code so that if you give incorrect parameters the program exits
        cleanly, rather than segfaulting.

Tue Oct 28 20:49:28 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp (start): NT Access Violation error, AGAIN! Added
          codes to reset this->handler_ so that
          ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy won't complain.

Tue Oct 28 19:19:05 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/{be_state.cpp, be_union.cpp, be_struct.cpp}: Added code
        that will generate the ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro

        *TAO_IDL/be/be_type.cpp: Implemented be_type::nexted_type_name
        that will generate the ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro. However, this may
        not be completely correct at this point because we want to see if
        teh compiler fails for types defined in some ancestor and whose
        fully scoped names are generated .

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Added code that will generate the
        _bind call on the interface class.

        * TAO/tests/IDL_Cubit: Added the _bind call in clnt.cpp. Improved
        the README file.

        *MAXNAMELEN : There was a clash with TAO_CodeGen::MAXNAMELEN. So
        it has been substituted by NAMEBUFSIZE as a macro in be_codegen.h

Mon Oct 27 22:22:22 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_decl.cpp: Added a ptr () function to the _var classes
        hat returns the underlying ptr_ data member. This ptr () member
        function is now used to pass a pointer type to constructor and
        assignment operator from a T_var class.

        * TAO_IDL/be_state.cpp: Important changes related to generation of
        return values of operations in the stubs. In addition, an & was
        missing for passing string types. Some additional bugs arising out
        of operations with void return type have been fixed.

        * ./tests/IDL_Cubit: This test has been modified to include a
        factory interface that reads a key for the cubit object and
        produces an obj reference for Cubit. In addition, a preliminary
        version of the _bind call has been tested with IDL_Cubit.

        *MAXNAMELEN : Carlos informed me that MAXNAMELEN was a small
        constant on some platforms. This has been changed to
        TAO_CodeGen::MAXNAMELEN with a value of 100.

Mon Oct 27 22:07:58 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_structure.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:
          Set this->cli_stub_gen_ to I_TRUE once the code has been
          emitted.

Mon Oct 27 19:34:08 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_enum.cpp:
          Set this->cli_stub_gen_ to I_TRUE at the end.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
          Set the state to TAO_CodeGen::TAO_TYPEDEF_CH instead of just
          struct.

Mon Oct 27 15:22:24 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_factory.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_state.h:
        * tao/iioporb.cpp:
        * tao/marshal.cpp:
        * tao/optable.cpp:
        * tao/optable.h:
        * tao/singletons.h:
        The ACE_Singleton lock type needs to be changed from
        ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX (or ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX) ACE_SYNCH_RECURSIVE_MUTEX.
        ACE handles those more efficiently for its singletons.  Change
        suggested by David Levine.

Mon Oct 27 11:59:51 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Made it so _FAR is defined all the time.  Thanks
        to Manojkumar Acharya <cvsf325.gpt.co.uk> for reporting this.

Sun Oct 26 22:18:01 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.17, released Sun Oct 26 22:18:01 1997.

Sun Oct 26 17:53:25 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * {tao,tests}/Makefile: Commented out the TAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE in
        these Makefiles since it is going away anyhow and is confusing...

        * tests/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf,
          tests/Cubit/TAO/svc.conf:
        Changed the default concurrency policy to be reactive so that
        things work correctly if TAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE.  Thanks to Sumedh
        for pointing this out.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (ORB_init): Put the TAO_DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT into
        ACE's OS.h file and used it in TAO.

Sun Oct 26 15:07:18 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/params.h: Eliminated forward decls of the now-defunct ROA
        class.

        * tao/orb_core.h (TAO_DEFAULT_PORT): Added manifest constant for
        default port.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (ORB_init): Eliminated ugly anonymous constant
        use for hbuf's size.  Utilized manifest constant for default port.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Changed calls to
        TAO_Client_Connection_Handler::in_use() to call the underlying
        Svc_Handler::idle().

        * tao/connect.{h,i}: Eliminated in_use() flags because they're no
        longer needed with the new Strategy Connector.

        * tao/iioporb.cpp (string_to_object): Removed setting of the orb
        in the underlying CORBA::Object because it's no longer there.

        * tao/object.{h,i} (CORBA_Object): Eliminated the pointer to an orb
        within this object.  This should help solve some problems in
        passing object references across the wire.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Added template instantiations for
        ACE_Hash_Map_Iterator to reflect Irfan's recent changes.

        * tests/IDL_Cubit/README: Updated documentation on the server to
        reflect current reality.

Sun Oct 26 01:01:32 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Redid the template specialization of Hash_Addr
        to account for the new changes.

Sun Oct 26 01:05:36 1997    <nw1@COYOTE>

        * tao/corba.h: Changed from using Strategies_T.h to Strategies.h.

        * tao/connect.h: Removed a template argument form ACE_Hash_Addr.
          Removed explicit instantiation of compare_i.

        * tao/connect.cpp:  Removed a template argument from explicit
          instantiation of ACE_Hash_Addr.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/clnt.cpp (main): Added a simple class
          ACE_Winsock_proper_shutdown here to shutdown winsock properly.
          This class should be removed later once we figure out how to
          close down winsock properly from ACE.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svc.conf: Changed the name of shared object from
          libTAO to TAO.  Added configuration lines for using debug
          version of TAO library on NT.

Sun Oct 26 01:47:04 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (tc_name2long):
        Added "unsigned" to index variable "i" used in for() loop,

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_stack.cpp (push):
        Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unused variable warning,
        for variable slen.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h (class TAO_OutStream):
        Made destructor virtual; we have virtual member functions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (TAO_CodeGen):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (be_decl):
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_stack.cpp (UTL_ScopeStack):
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp (UTL_ScopeActiveIterator):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to
        satisfy the compiler.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp (lookup_primitive_type):
        Added "default" case to switch to return NULL.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp (add_attribute):

        Use 0 instead of NULL to initialize pointers in the
        member initialization list, again to avoid ANSI C++ forbids
        implicit (void *) conversions warnings.

Sun Oct 26 01:01:32 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.16, released Sun Oct 26 01:01:32 1997.

Sun Oct 26 00:32:29 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll: Reverted a change that Carlos had
        overwritten.  I guess he's not getting enough sleep these
        days... ;-)

Sun Oct 26 00:31:38 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/orb_core.i (hash_i): Redid the specialization in view of the
          new changes.

Sat Oct 25 18:14:14 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (be_interface): Worked around a
        nasty MSVC++ compiler bug that doesn't like CORBA::Object
        (object_ptr).  So we use an existing ACE macro for this.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (be_interface): Fixed yet another
        round of uninitialized data members.  It is clear that the
        original authors of this code wouldn't pass my ugrad programming
        course...

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll (idl_parse_line_and_file): Had to make a minor
        change to skip over the #line directive from Microsoft.  In
        addition, had to add some code to put Microsoft-style pathnames
        into a canonical form (i.e., replacing = '\\' with '\').  Thanks
        to Darrell for helping with this.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll: Added a new rule to handle the fact
        that the Microsoft C++ preprocessor generates tags of the
        form

        #line 1 "bar.idl"

        rather than

        #1 "bar.idl"

        which is what UNIX C++ compilers seem to do.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (compute_fullname, compute_flatname):
        Fixed a nasty bug where the original author thought new always
        returned 0'd memory...  Sheesh!

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: Changed fd < 0 to fd ==
        ACE_INVALID_HANDLE to be more portable.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp (be_decl): There were two fields,
        flatname_ and repoID_, that weren't given initial values of 0.
        Thanks to Purify for finding this!

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.{yy,ll}: Replaced all uses of type names <name>
        (e.g., FLOAT) with IDL_<name> (e.g., IDL_FLOAT) so that the code
        won't bomb on lame systems like NT that typedef basic types to all
        capitals (e.g., typedef float FLOAT).

Sat Oct 25 22:28:42 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll: Since yytext may be an "unsigned char*" under
          HP-UX they define an "alias" __yytext. This hack fails miserably
          when using flex, since then the yytext thing can change on the
          fly. I use an inline function instead.  Added support for #line
          preprocessor directives.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: Documented some of my changes
          for NT, namely the fact that unlinking the output file while
          still open causes the parsing to fail on NT.

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp: Added new folders for source files, header
          files, template files, etc. I modelled this based on the ACE
          project files.

Sat Oct 25 22:05:43 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_constant.cpp (exprtype_to_string):
        Added case statements to handle the rest of un-handled
        enumerations from AST_Expression::ExprType.  These will
        handle a default value (i.e. the same case as
        AST_Expression::EV_none).

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (operator==):
        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (compare):
        Make the default return value I_FALSE instead of NULL which
        was  giving "lacks a cast" warning.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (fill_definition_details):
        Use 0 instead of NULL to initialize pointers in the
        member initialization list, again to avoid ANSI C++ forbids
        implicit (void *) conversions warnings.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (eval_symbol):
        Initialized pointers to 0.

Sat Oct 25 17:45:17 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: Fixed the same bug that Sumedh
        fixed. In addition, ACEified the calls to strcat and strcmp in
        that file.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll: Used %array in the defintion section so that
        flex uses yytext as an array of characters rather than pointer to
        char. The pointer case was resulting in a segmentation fault due
        to lack of memory allocation for the yytext variable. However, we
        choose to use the array approach to be compatile with "lex"
        behavior.

Sat Oct 25 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: Fixed proper tmp filename
        creation.

Sat Oct 25 14:14:53 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@MILONGA>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsw:
        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.dsp:
          Added a MSVC++ project file for the IDL compiler, needs several
          revisions byt the NT experts before shipping, but it has served
          me well.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_fork.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          We use ACE components to fork&exec subprocesses, get the default
          TMP directory and generate protable pathnames.
          In one case the mapping to NT is not clear: the use case is fork
          to get a "fresh" copy of the process and provide a unit of
          protection for the parent; this feature is only used if more
          than one IDL file is compiled at the same time.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp:
          Fixed minor bug, it said "second - I_FALSE;", it should be
          "second = I_FALSE

Sat Oct 25 06:22:03 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy: I got errors parsing the idl.yy thru
        bison. There were errors indicating "type clash on default action".

        This had to do with the fact that the non-terminal "type_dcl" did not
        have any type defined for it, but it had "struct_type", "union_type"
        and others on the right-hand side of the rules. The default action of
        YACC is supposed to assign $1 to $$. So the type for "struct_type"
        that happened to be a AST_Decl node was getting assigned to the
        non-terminal "type_dcl" who had no type.

        I am very surprised that the "yacc" on our Sparcs never ever gave this
        error, but bison did.

        Hence I have modified idl.yy slightly so that I have {$$ = 0;} as the
        default action. In addition, the non-terminal "type_dcl" is now
        defined to be of type "ival" which is defined as long inside the
        %union clause.

        Above all, the bison generated files required some prototypes. So I
        had to add the following to idl.yy in the declarations section.

        int yylex (void);
        void yyerror (char *);
        extern "C" yywrap (void);

        Somehow, this yywrap had to be under extern "C". I don't know why the
        others need not be under extern "C".


Sat Oct 25 00:05:05 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.15, released Sat Oct 25 00:05:05 1997.

Sat Oct 25 02:46:05 1997  Sergio Flores  <sergio@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/Makefile:
        Changed the YACC variable to use the bison compiler.
        Added "-y" to YFLAGS to make bison generate output files like yacc.
        Changed the LEX variable to use the flex parser instead of lex.
        These programs generate code that has less warnings and is better
        code in general.
        Added "-D_REENTRANT" to CPPFLAGS, to be able to eliminate the warnings
        in lex.yy.cpp.  This could also be fixed if we include "ace/ACE.h" at
        the beginning of lex.yy.cpp, but this file is generated with flex.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
        Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unused variable warning,
        for variable "AST_Decl *v".

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll (idl_atof):
        Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unused variable warning,
        for variable f and h.

        * TAO_IDL/include/idl.h:
        Added include file "ace/ACE.h".  This was necessary to eliminate
        warnings of implicit declarations, which were because the _REENTRANT
        flag was not defined.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_operation.cpp (AST_Operation):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to
        eliminate warnings from the compiler.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_operation.cpp (fe_add_exceptions):
        Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unused variable warning,
        for variable fs.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_interface.cpp (AST_Interface):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to

        Added case statements to handle the rest of un-handled
        enumerations from AST_Expression::ExprType.  These will
        handle a default value (i.e. the same case as
        AST_Expression::EV_none).  Enumerations added are:
        AST_Expression::EV_wstring
        AST_Expression::EV_wchar
        AST_Expression::EV_longdouble
        AST_Expression::EV_ulonglong
        AST_Expression::EV_longlong

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (AST_Expression):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to
        eliminate warnings from the compiler.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_decl.cpp (AST_Decl):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to
        eliminate warnings from the compiler.
        Also, use 0 instead of NULL to initialize pointers in the
        member initialization list, again to avoid ANSI C++ forbids
        implicit (void *) conversions warnings.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_array.cpp (dump):
        Added "unsigned" to index variable "i" used in for() loop,
        to avoid warning "comparison between unsigned and signed"

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_array.cpp (compute_dims):
        Added "unsigned" to index variable "i" used in for() loop,
        to avoid warning "comparison between unsigned and signed"

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_array.cpp (AST_Array):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to
        eliminate warnings from the compiler.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_declarator.cpp (FE_Declarator):
        Reordered member initializers to match declaration order to
        eliminate warnings from the compiler.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_main.cpp (DRV_drive):
        Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unused variable warning.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_recursive.cpp (AST_illegal_recursive_type):
        Initialized pointer variables to avoid warnings.

Fri Oct 24 19:18:22 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Changed remaining uses of BOA to POA.

        * cubit_i.cpp (please_exit): Replaced the call to
        please_shutdown() on the POA (which no longer exists) with the
        shutdown() call on the ORB.

        * tests/IDL_Cubit/svr.cpp: Removed

        oa_ptr->clean_shutdown (env);

        since this is no longer supported in TAO's POA.

        * tao/poa.h: Changed the get_boa() method to get_poa().  Even this
        will probably go away soon.

Fri Oct 24 18:25:00 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/svrrqst.cpp: Method params was allocating memory even
        when the Any's already had memory allocated for the IN and INOUT
        parameters. Due to this the params would retrieve results in the
        allocated storage whereas the stubs/skeletons would continue to
        use variables that they had defined to hold the values.

Fri Oct 24 17:33:21 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/poa.*: #ifdef'd out the IIOP 1.4 references to shutdown.
        I'm leaving them in there right now because they might be useful
        as private member later when we need to figure out how to get OAs
        to cooperate and shut themselves down in the face of an ORB
        shutdown.

        * tao/orbobj.h (shutdown): Fixed up documentation.

        * tao/orbobj.i (shutdown): Provided appropriate arg default.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svr.cpp: Eliminated unnecessary Object Adapter
        name from POA_init() invocation.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/cubit_i.cpp (Cubit_please_exit): Revised to use
        the new ORB::shutdown() method.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/clnt.cpp: Got rid of IIOP 1.4-style debug
        message calls.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (CORBA_ORB::ORB_init): Corrected a heinous
        problem in the option parsing loop where argvec_shift() would be
        asked to shift two argv elements when there was only one.  This
        could cause problems if an option that required an argument didn't
        include the argument.  Thanks to Manojkumar Acharya
        <cvsf325.gpt.co.uk> for sending in a bug report that lead to my
        finding this!

Fri Oct 24 14:08:12  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Improved the compiler to make Unions work. The most subtle error
        was the way the private section of the class for unions was being
        generated. TAO's Typecode library expected the union members to be
        inside of a C++  union declaration inside the private
        section. Whereas the compiler was generating each member
        separately.

        Another source of error was bad typecode tables getting
        generated. This is now fixed.

        * TAO/tests/IDL_Cubit: The cubit_i.cpp for cube_union was doing
        wrong calculations for structs. This was due to my copy-paste
        tendency and not verifying if it was correct or not. This has been
        fixed. The README file is updated to reflect the fact that this
        directory contains code that uses the IDL compiler.

Fri Oct 24 01:54:00 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.14, released Fri Oct 24 01:54:00 1997.

Fri Oct 24 01:02:01 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * clnt.cpp: Removed mysterious obsolete definitions of
        cube_union_stub() and cube_union_dii().

        * be_state.h: Added definitions for the methods in class
        be_state_attribute.  For some reason, they were missing.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_state.cpp: Added the necessary template
        specializations so that the TAO IDL compiler will work with GCC.

Thu Oct 23 22:46:10 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO IDL Compiler: More progress in terms of getting the Cubit
        example to work with the IDL generated code. However, we are still
        finding some problems with using the client-side cubit_union_dii
        to work properly.

        Much of the improvements were to the server-side skeletons for
        operations. In addition, code for union constructors, assignment
        operator, and accessor for discriminant added.

        Some bugs in typecode generation are fixed. This had to do with
        the encapsulation length for predefined types. It was returning -1
        as opposed to 0.

        * TAO/tests/IDL_Cubit: Added this directory with the cubit
        example. Use this to test the IDL compiler. The makefile will
        invoke the IDL compiler to create the required files.

Thu Oct 23 18:34:02 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/*/Makefile: Fixed the Makefiles so that it has the correct
        files and dependencies.  Thanks to Steven Wohlever
        <wohlever@mitre.org> for reporting this.

Wed Oct 22 20:02:39 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * README.sun: Added an explicit reminder at the top that the
        information in this file is historical in nature and does not
        necessarily apply to current reality.

        * tao/orbobj.* (shutdown): Added code to the run() event loop so
        that it will terminate when it finds a flag set.  This involved
        adding the flag to the ORB's state and minimally implementing the
        shutdown() method.  The shutdown method still does not honor the
        "wait for completion" flag which can be passed to it, though.

        * README: Updated the season from "summer" to "Fall" ;-) Also
        added a note that warned people not to try to link TAO with a
        version of ACE that's linked with another ORB library, e.g.,
        liborbix.so.  Thanks to Steven Wohlever <wohlever@mitre.org> for
        bringing this instructional omission to our attention.

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp (fake_service_entries_i): Made the body of
        this function conditional on the TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP
        preprocessor definition since it doesn't need to exist in
        platforms that grok the Service Configurator.  This will also
        reduce the memory footprint :-).  Thanks to David Miron
        <dxm@crapper.dsto.defence.gov.au> for pointing this out!

        * tao/orb_core.cpp (TAO_ORB_Core): Removed explicit CTOR
        initialization of reactor_ member.

Wed Oct 22 19:37:22 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO IDL Compiler: Improvements made so that the server-side
        skeletons for operations now generate valid code. The code
        generated for the Cubit.idl was compiling cleanly. It is under
        test currently to see if it runs.

        * Some progress in handling forward declarations of interfaces.

Wed Oct 22 12:55:19 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/poa.h:  Added ACE_Svc_Export to class CORBA_POA.

        * tao/TAO.{mdp,mak}:  Updated files in project file.

        * tao/TAO.dsp: Removed boa, Orb_Core and added poa, orb_core to
          the project file.

Tue Oct 21 17:21:51 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/orbcore.html: Updated to reflect daily
        progress.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svc.conf: Updated to eliminate empty quotes at
        the end that tickled a deficiency in the Service Configurator's
        grammar.

        * tests/multiCubit/svr.cpp: Updated to reflect POA_init change.

        * tests/Thruput_test/Makefile: Modified to reflect filename
        changes.

        * tests/Thruput_test/server.cpp: Changed type of argv so that it
        matched properly.

        * tao/boa.*: Renamed to tao/poa.*.

        * tao/Orb_Core.*: Renamed to tao/orb_core.*.

        * tao/{Makefile,corba.h,default_client.cpp,default_server.cpp,orb.h,orbobj.cpp,params.h}:
        Modified to reflect filename changes.

Tue Oct 21 13:23:48 1997 Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/connect.i: Moved hash_i and compare_i template
          specialization to Orb_Core.i.  Original code was left comment
          out until this mod is checked on all platforms.

        * tao/Orb_Core.i: Added hash_i and compare_i code from connect.i.

Tue Oct 21 03:23:29 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Orb_Core.cpp: Removed conditional inclusion of Orb_Core.i
          since, according to corba.h, it is always included as an inline
          function file.

Tue Oct 21 02:24:14 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.13, released Tue Oct 21 02:24:14 1997.

Mon Oct 20 23:42:48 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/boa: Changed BOA_init() to POA_init() to be
          more consistent...

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp,
          tests/TAO/Thruput_test/server.cpp,
          tests/TAO/Thruput_test/ttcpS.cpp,
          tests/TAO/RT_test/Task_Client.cpp,
          tests/TAO/RT_test/cubit_impl.cpp,
          tests/TAO/multiCubit/cubitS.cpp,
          tests/TAO/multiCubit/svr.cpp,
          tests/TAO/Demux_Test/server.cpp,
          tests/TAO/Demux_Test/CodeGen/skel.cpp,
          tests/TAO/MT-Cubit/client/Task_Client.cpp,
          tests/TAO/MT-Cubit/server/cubitS.cpp,
          tests/TAO/MT-Cubit/server/svr.cpp,
          tests/TAO/cubitS.cpp,
          tests/TAO/svr.cpp,
          tests/TAO/test1_svr.cpp: Changed BOA to POA to reflect the
          new naming conventions.

        * tao/stub.i (STUB_Object): Removed a stray default value from the
        STUB_Object constructor...  Thanks to Carlos for noticing this.

MOn Oct 20 10:14:09 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Improved version of the TAO IDL compiler. The executable has
        been renamed to tao_idl. There are a number of improvements as
        well as shortcomings. These are explained in the
        docs/releasenotes/index.html page, which can be viewed online at
        http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/docs/releasenotes/.

Mon Oct 20 16:30:29 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp (fake_service_entries_i): Based the
        arguments to the faked server service entry for VxWorks on the
        TAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE compilation flag.  This should hopefully
        eliminate the problems Boeing was seeing in the early rounds of
        testing the most recent release of TAO.

        * tao/{iiopobj.*,giop.h}: Moved a lock that had been in
        TAO_GIOP_Invocation (why?  I don't know) into IIOP_Object.  It
        protects the fwd_profile_ pointer, which has now become private.
        Also added accessors for the data member as well as the lock.
        Accessors come in two flavors--thead-safe (fwd_profile()) and
        non-thread-safe (fwd_profile_i()).  The non-thread-safe variety
        expect that the lock will be taken and held for the duration of
        their usage, but no checking is performed in this respect.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Changed references to the IIOP_Object::fwd_profile
        data member to go through the new accessors (see above).

        * tao/stub.i: Created new file with inline methods for
        STUB_Object.

        * tao/stub.h: Moved inline method definitions into a new
        file--stub.i.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (BOA_init): Eliminated dead code and unused
        variable.

        * tao/except.cpp (print_exception): Eliminated unused argument
        warning detected by gcc.

        * tao/corba.h: Re-ordered inclusion of Orb_Core.i to eliminate
        'function used before declared inline' errors detected by gcc.

        * tao/{Orb_Core,boa,corbacom,orb,orbobj,svrrqst}.*: Renamed BOA to
        POA.

        * docs/releasenotes*: Moved releasenotes.html into a directory
        named "releasenotes" so that the various status pages can live
        independently.  Currently only the ORB Core's status page is
        broken out, but the documentation should eventually turn into two
        frames with the one at the top acting as the guide and the lower
        frame being the actual status document.

Fri Oct 17 17:42:27 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes.html: Updated to reflect current status.

        * tao/orbobj.*: Added some documentation for open() method.

        * tao/roa.*: Gone.  Bye-bye.  Removed.

Fri Oct 17 15:43:04 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/connect.h: Added template instantiation supression directive
          for Win32.  VC was complaining about duplicate symbols definition.

Fri Oct 17 06:25:23 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{boa,roa}.*: Merged class ROA into class
        CORBA_BOA. Hopefully everything still works ;-)

        * docs/releasenotes.html: Quick update for new TODO list.  Will be
        updated within the next day or so with dates, too.

        * tao/{server_factory,orbobj,Orb_Core}.cpp: Corrected incorrect
        explicit template instantiations and added missing ones.

Thu Oct 16 23:48:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.12, released Thu Oct 16 23:48:04 1997.

Thu Oct 16 11:15:00 1997  Brian R. Mendel <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/server_factory.cpp: Added instantiation pragma for VxWorks for
          ACE_Acceptor.  Added the template to the specialization section, also.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Added instantiation pragma for VxWorks for
          ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy and ACE_Hash_Map_Manager for
          ACE_Null_Mutex instantiations.  Also, added these to the template
          specialization sections.

        * tests/Cubit/Build/default.bld: Added TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP
          to defines section of GHS build file.

Tue Oct 14 21:11:20 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/xdr.h: Changed int _fd to ACE_HANDLE _fd to work on NT.
          Thanks to Satheesh Kumar <satheesh@aspectdv.com> for reporting
          this.

Tue Oct 14 02:48:21 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.11, released Tue Oct 14 02:48:21 1997.

Mon Oct 13 23:30:16 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

        * tao/connect.h: If we are using TSS, there is no reason to use
          locking in the connector. Therefore, I added a new typedef that
          defines the type of lock that should be used for the
          cached_connect_strategy.  It is ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX in the
          non-TSS case, and ACE_SYNCH_NULL_MUTEX in the TSS case.

Mon Oct 13 21:34:00 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/svrrqst.cpp (oa): Cleaned up the coding style a bit.

Sun Oct 12 15:38:35 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/client_factory: Gutted the client factory code related to
          the Strategy_Connector so that it's either in the TAO_Orb_Core.

        * tao/default_client.h: Removed the connector() from the
          Default_Client_Factory entirely since it's all been put into the
          TAO_ORB_Core now.

        * tao/giop.cpp (start): Hacked up the code so that we extract our
          connector from thread-specific storage if we're using the
          thread-per-rate concurrency model.  This needs to be integrated
          more cleverly in the ORB.

        * tao/orbobj.h: Put an instance of the TAO_CONNECTOR into each
          TAO_ORB_Core object so that we don't have to share these things
          among all of the threads in a process, but instead can have them
          be located in thread-specific storage.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (perform_work): Updated the run() and
          perform_work() methods to take optional ACE_Time_Value *'s (so
          they can return from timeouts) and to return error flags if
          things go wrong.

        * tao/orbobj.h (CORBA_ORB): Changed the set_up_for_listening()
          call to open(), which is more consistent with other usage in
          ACE/TAO.

        * tao/orbobj: Changed the name client_acceptor_ to peer_acceptor_
          to reflect the fact that the connection model is more generic
          than the notion of client/server interactions (which really take
          place as the result of particular communication roles).

        * tao/corba.h: Moved the order of #includes around so that
          "connect.h" is included before "client_factory.h"

        * tao/connect.h: Moved the typedef of the ACE_Strategy_Connector<>
          from the TAO_Client_Strategy_Factory into the global space and
          renamed it TAO_CONNECTOR file so that it will be equivalent with
          the TAO_ACCEPTOR.

Thu Oct  9 23:17:37 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp (invoke): If an error occurs, make sure to mark the
          handler_ as no longer being in use before we set it to 0.

        * tao/giop.cpp (TAO_GIOP_Invocation): We need to make sure that
          handler_ isn't 0 before we mark it as no longer being in use.

Thu Oct  9 11:33:46 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/giop.cpp:
          There was a minor sintax error.

Tue Oct 07 09:34:35 1997    <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/Orb_Core.h{cpp}: Added ACE_Svc_Export label to global
        TAO_ORB_Core_instance() method.  Needed for DLL support on NT.i

        * default.bld, tao.bld: Modified VxWorks build files to add new files.

Tue Oct 07 07:05:38 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.10, released Tue Oct 07 07:05:38 1997.

Mon Oct 06 22:11:40 1997    <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/cubit_i.cpp (Cubit_please_exit):
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/cubitS.cpp (_skel_Cubit): Changed to use the new
          TAO_ORB_CORE_instance () global function.

Mon Oct  6 20:06:05 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{boa.h,connect.cpp,giop.cpp,giop.h,roa.cpp,roa.h}:
        Eliminated unused methods and code.

        * tao/Orb_Core.*: Created new global function called
        TAO_ORB_Core_instance() which will return the correct instance of
        the ORB Core state.  This had previously been accessed using
        TAO_ORB_CORE::instance(), but Win32s linking procedures made the
        template for TAO_ORB_CORE expand in both the application and the
        library/DLL, thus creating two singletons.  Bad scene.  The
        function should force the expansion of the template to only be in
        the DLL.

        * tao/{connect,default_client,default_server,orbobj,roa}.cpp:
        Changed references to TAO_ORB_CORE::instance() to
        TAO_ORB_Core_instance().

        * tao/singletons.h: Removed definition of TAO_ORB_CORE.

Sat Oct  4 20:08:57 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.{dsp,dsw}: Added tao_internals.cpp into project file
          list.

        * tao/tao_internals.h (TAO_Internal): Added ACE_Svc_Export and
          $ I d $.

        * tao/tao_internals.i (open_services): Added default return value
          0.

        * tao/tao_internals.cpp: Added #include "tao/tao_internals.h" and
          the CVS $ I d $ field.  Also, we should include inline (.i) file
          for inline code.

Fri Oct  3 09:29:05 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/multiCubit/svr.cpp: Changed the key naming scheme back to
        not be unique throughout the process.  Process-unique code is
        still there, but conditionally compiled mutually-exclusive to the
        other scheme.

        * tao/server_factory.*: The object_lookup_strategy method is gone
        and is replaced by the create_object_table factor method.  See
        more information below.

        * tao/default_server.*: The server factory no longer holds on to a
        single pointer for the object lookup strategy.  In previous
        incarnations of TAO, this didn't cause problems, but the advent of
        ORB-per-thread highlighted the inherent badness in this
        implementation choice.  Gone is the object_lookup_strategy method,
        and in comes the create_object_table factory method, which creates
        and returns (and doesn't hold onto) an object table in accordance
        with parameters such as size and search algorithm.

        * tao/roa.cpp: Changed to use the create_object_table method.

Thu Oct  2 13:48:31 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/multiCubit/svr.cpp: Modified the key generation scheme to
        include thread ID.  This works around a current shortcoming in the
        ORB Core in which the object table is shared throughout all object
        adapters (yes, this is being fixed).

        * tao/tao_internals.*: Added new class to scope static operations
        and data completely internal to the ORB.

        * tao/orbobj.{i,cpp}: Moved CORBA_ORB DTOR into cpp file.  Finally
        got rid of icky static mutex in ORB_init().  Moved service config
        initialization into TAO_Internal method.

        * tao/Orb_Core.h: Added comments.

Wed Oct  1 12:51:48 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbacom.h: Removed CORBA:: name resolution from the class
          String_out which is itself defined in class CORBA.  MSVC doesn't
          like that.

Wed Oct  1 10:44:55 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/varout.h: Fixed some template errors in class
        TAO_Object_out. This was pointed to me by Carlos as he was
        compiling TAO in SGI.

Wed Oct  1 09:10:38 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes.html:
          Updated information on the Event Channel, the use of the Naming
          Service is no longer a plan, it is done already.

Tue Sep 30 20:14:29 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.9, released Tue Sep 30 20:14:29 1997.

Tue Sep 30 19:42:09 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Removed "docs" from DIRS so we don't try to run
        make in this directory.

Tue Sep 30 17:27:00 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * <RELEASE>: Tagged a release for limited consumption until the
        Service Configurator bug is fixed.

        * tests/multiCubit/svr.cpp: Added code to properly release CORBA
        objects.  Delays between task activations simply aid in debugging
        and are not necessary.

        * tao/singletons.h: Made TAO_ORB_Core's singleton type
        compile-time selectable via the TAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE compiler flag.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Corrected an incorrect shift count, and the ORB
        Core now defaults to using the host name of the local host.

        * tao/Orb_Core.[hi]: Added explicit CTOR.

        * tao/Orb_Core.cpp: Insured that the correct template type was
        instantiated.

        * tao/Makefile: Added -DTAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE to CPPFLAGS.

Tue Sep 30 16:43:12 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes.html: Added some notes on the ORB Core.

Mon Sep 29 14:39:51 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/{index,components,releasenotes}.html: Added additional
        documentation.

Mon Sep 29 13:50:34 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO ORB changes:

        any.*: Added _var and _out classes.

        corbacom.{h,i} : Added _out types for primitive types, added _out and
        updated _var classes for String. Added corbacom.i for implementing
        the String's _var and _out classes

        sequence.{h,i}: Added a number of templates for _var and _out
        classes. However, these are yet to be used and tested.

        * Alpha release of TAO IDL compiler added to this release. This is
        an alpha release and we are currently putting it to rigorous
        test. A large amount of code for the back end is added under the
        TAO/TAO_IDL/be_include and TAO/TAO_IDL/be/ directories.

        In addition, some amount of ACEification done to methods belonging
        to the TAO/TAO_IDL/utils/ classes.

        A few errors in the IDL grammar have been fixed in
        fe/idl.yy. These had to do with the valid types for parameters and
        operation return types. There are still some errors recognizing
        unions which will be fixed later. The scanner (fe/idl.l) was
        modified to recognize the OMG IDL data type "any".

        * The ChangeLog file under TAO/TAO_IDL is removed and its contents
        are inserted appropriately in this ChangeLog file

Sun Sep 28 17:01:27 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/multiCubit: Added a multi-threaded version of Cubit.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: At long last, Andy has his wish for not having
        to provide a "-ORBhost <me>" argument to a server.  It now uses
        ACE_OS::hostname() to determine the canonical hostname, and
        listens on that address.

        * tao/singletons.h: Changed the ORB Core singleton to be a TSS
        singleton; this will eventually be conditionally compiled in
        (before release).  Also added comments and "safety defines".

        * tao/except.cpp: Changed some usage of fputs() in
        print_exception() to use ACE_DEBUG.

Sun Sep 28 03:18:24 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/cubitC.h (Object): Changed references of base
          class from "CORBA::Object" to "CORBA_Object."  MSVC doesn't
          allow this.

        * tao/Orb_Core.h: Added ACE_Svc_Export to TAO_Orb_Core class.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added ACE_Svc_Export to all IID constants.
          Notice that we must put ACE_Svc_Export _after_ extern "C".

Sat Sep 27 09:31:42 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Orb_Core.h: Fixed the friend declaration for
        CORBA::ORB_init().

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svr.cpp: Modified to use ORB::run() for event
        loop and eliminated code cruft.

        * tao/orbobj.*: Added stubs for 4 methods on the ORB from the
        POA spec: work_pending, perform_work, run, and shutdown.  Of all
        of these, only run is reasonably implemented, and there not even
        according to the spec (because the way the spec works isn't really
        good for our purposes...need to work on that).  See the docs for
        information.

        Moved the initialization of the Acceptor into its own method,
        set_up_for_listening (which is a one-shot style method), and
        placed a call to this within the aforementioned run method.

        * tao/default_client.h: Miscellaneous comments added.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Corrected an errant ACE_DEBUG () call.

        * tao/Orb_Core.*: Added private methods to allow setting of the
        orb and extended the laurel of friendship to CORBA::ORB_init().

Fri Sep 26 10:20:06 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.*: Added acceptor initialization code to CORBA_ORB
        CTOR.  (We still need to find a way to NOT do this on the client
        side.)  Moved CORBA_ORB CTOR into .cpp to avoid nasty
        interdependencies caused when it was in the .i file.  Moved the
        specification of host and port to be ORB parameters rather than OA
        parameters, i.e., -OAhost is now -ORBhost and -OAport is now
        -ORBport.

        * tao/roa.*: Removed server-side connection endpoint
        initialization (Acceptor stuff) and put it into the ORB.

        * tao/connect.h: Renamed ROA_Acceptor to TAO_Acceptor (since it's
        not related to the OA any longer), and restored explicit inclusion
        of ace headers to avoid having to include "corba.h".

        * tao/boa.h: Removed unneeded get_addr() method.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/cubitS.cpp: Updates to support changes in ORB
        Core.

Thu Sep 25 12:28:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/params.*: Added explicit CTOR & DTOR for
        TAO_{OA,ORB}_Parameters classes that somehow got removed in the
        previous round of attacks.  Also specified all methods which go
        into the .i file as "LOCAL_INLINE" within the header.  This avoids
        having to unravel ugly, complex order interdependencies.

Thu Sep 25 03:48:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Terse documentation on options available for
        the abstract factories.

        * tao/Orb_Core.*: Added this class (TAO_ORB_Core) to hold the
        "state" of an ORB.  The intent is that as we move towards
        different concurrency models, this can be thrown into
        thread-specific storage and remain a singleton, essentially
        allowing the running of an ORB-per-thread.

        * tao/singletons.h: Added this file to contain type definitions
        for *ALL* ACE_Singleton<> types used within TAO.  This was
        motivated by a desire to eliminate the multitude of warnings
        generated by g++ regarding methods being called before declared
        inline, and the only way to eliminate this was to insure that all
        inlined methods were seen by the compiler before the
        ACE_Singleton<> definition.  Thus, corba.h includes singleton.h as
        the very last thing that it does.

        * tao/params.*: TAO_OA_Parameters is no longer a singleton, and
        because of new recognition of associations in the object model for
        an ORB, lots of data members and their methods have been shuffled
        to other places or eliminated.  addr() now belongs in
        TAO_ORB_Parameters, and root_poa_ is in TAO_ORB_Core.  The
        using_threads_, thread_flags_, upcall_, and forwarder_ members
        have been eliminated and their roles taken over by the Concurrency
        Strategies and the new Dispatch call chain implemented in my last
        round of changes.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Changed references to the ORB singleton to go
        through TAO_ORB_CORE::instance().  Also eliminated an unnecessary
        global function (_orb()).

        * tao/marshal.h: Moved all ACE_Singleton<> typedefs into
        singleton.h.  See comment on tao/corba.h for more information.

        * tao/iioporb.h: Removed unnecessary TAO_ORB singleton.  This is
        now assumed by TAO_ORB_Core instances.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added CORBA::POA_ptr for upward compatibility.

        * tao/corba.h: Added Orb_Core.[hi] to the appropriate places.
        Moved iiop{orb,obj}.i inclusions around and moved typedef'ing of
        all ACE_Singletons into singletons.h, which must be #included
        AFTER all the inline files.  This eliminated all of the
        used-before-declared-inline warnings.

        * tao/{connect,default_client,default_server,roa}.*: Updated
        singleton usages to go through the TAO_ORB_CORE singleton.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/{cubitS,cubit_i}.cpp: Updated singleton usages
        to go through the TAO_ORB_CORE singleton.

Wed Sep 17 12:26:56 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@CHA-CHA>

        * tao/TAO.dsp: Updated source file list.

Mon Sep 15 16:52:28 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/{cubitS,cubit_i}.cpp: Updated references to oa()
        to root_pos().

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Corrected some adjustments made for Service
        Configurator rework.

        * tao/giop.h: Moved the def for TAO_GIOP_EndOfFile out of the
        range of valid GIOP messages.

        * tao/connect.cpp: Added special case for TAO_GIOP_Reply to break
        out, and distinguished TAO_GIOP_EndOfFile from other errors by
        setting errno.

        * tao/boa.cpp: The complete reply header is now stuck into the
        response stream...what a novel concept!

Fri Sep 12 05:40:50 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * params.h: Renamed oa() method to be root_poa() in preparation
        for the future.

        * orbobj.cpp: Adjusted the FAKE_SVC_ENTRY macro to catch up to
        recent changes in ACE.

        * giop.*: Major surgery including elimination of GIOP as a giant
        namespace (now only static methods are in it).  Changed names of
        things to TAO_*.

        * {encode,decode,iiopobj,invoke,roa}.*: Name changes resulting
        from giop.cpp surgery.

        * corbacom.h: Moved TAO_opaque decl into here.

        * corba.h: Re-ordered the inline #includes so that the stuff that
        is ALWAYS inlined is included prior to the stuff that's only
        inlined when __ACE_INLINE__ is turned on.

        * connect.*: Modified handle_input() substantially.  Added 3
        template methods: read_message, handle_message, and send_response.

        * {cdr,marshal,object,typecode}.h: Removed the old "always include
        inlines" hackery.

        * boa.*: Added handle_request() method.

Wed Sep 03 06:15:00 1997  Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/default_client.cpp:  Added conditional sections around the code for setting the
        socket options for VxWorks.  VxWorks does not support a 64K buffer size.

Tue Sep 02 18:32:12 1997  Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp:  Added include for Service_Repository.h to orbobj.h

        * tao/debug.cpp: Removed the TAO_NEEDS_UNUSED_VARIABLES #defines
        around the debug_stream declaration.  debug_stream is used by
        dmsg_filter in debug.cpp.  Changed SYSTEM_EXCEPTION to
        CORBA::SYSTEM_EXCEPTION.

        * tao/default_client.cpp: Removed extra parameter from
        ACE_Hash_Map_Entry #pragma instantiate statement.

        * tao/objtable.cpp: Deleted pragmas for instantiating ACE_Guard,
        ACE_Read_Guard, and ACE_Write_Guard to eliminate duplicate
        instantiations.  Also, removed the instantiations from
        ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION for the same reason.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Added a typecast to void * in argvec_shift
        method.

        * tao/default.bld - Modified VxWorks Build File to change template
        instantiation modes.

        * tao/tao.bld - Added default_client.cpp, default_server.cpp,
        client_factory.cpp, and server_factory.cpp to the VxWorks build
        file.

        * tao/tao.dsp - Added default_client.cpp, default_server.cpp,
        client_factory.cpp, and server_factory.cpp to the Win NT project
        file.

Tue Sep  2 07:31:45 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (ORB_init): VxWorks doesn't use
        ACE_Service_Config for now; the default factories are used.  The
        Service Repository is still used, but the appropriate values are
        "stuffed" in manually.

Sat Aug 30 17:07:18 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thruput: First attempt at ACEifying it and removing the
        tremendous amount of unnecessary stuff that was in there. This
        modified version still needs testing on other platforms.

Fri Aug 29 10:59:34 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile (TAO_ROOT): FINALLY corrected the default
        definition of TAO_ROOT.

Thu Aug 28 14:04:44 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.i (CORBA_ORB): Removed assertion that was incorrect
        b/c our ORB object is a singleton and not dynamically allocated,
        thus the refcount can only reach zero at the end of its life.

        * tao/typecode.cpp (TC_Private_State): Relocated the delete of
        tc_discriminator_type_ to be after the deletion of the label list.
        This is because the discriminator will be inside each of the
        CORBA::Any instances within the label list, and deleting it before
        deleting the label list results in extreme badness.

        * tao/typecode.* (operator delete): Added CORBA_TypeCode::operator
        delete() to simplify deletion of both automatically and
        dynamically allocated instances of CORBA_TypeCode.  This fixes the
        problem of freeing non-heap memory.

        * tao/nvlist.h (CORBA_NamedValue): Initialized refcount_ in the
        CTOR.

Mon Aug 18 16:39:40 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile for TAO compiler:
          $(SOEXT) must be used instead of just .so, the former does not
          work on all platforms, notably HP-UX.

Mon Aug 18 16:39:29 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tests/Demux_Test/CodeGen/Makefile:
          $(SOEXT) must be used instead of just .so, the former does not
          work on all platforms, notably HP-UX.

Sun Aug 17 16:53:42 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@swarm.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/Orbeline/client/Profile_Timer.h:
        * IIOP/tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/base_server/Profile_Timer.cpp:
        * IIOP/tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/base_server/Profile_Timer.h:
        * IIOP/tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/client/Profile_Timer.cpp:
        * IIOP/tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/client/Profile_Timer.h:
        * tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/base_server/Profile_Timer.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/base_server/Profile_Timer.h:
        * tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/client/Profile_Timer.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/VisiBroker/client/Profile_Timer.h:
        We no longer use timestruct_t in ACE, it is a SYSVism; we use
        timespec_t instead.

Sat Aug 16 01:11:56 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/svc.conf: Added this as an example of an
        application's service config configuration file.  It also serves
        as the documentation for various strategy factory options at the
        moment.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Options parsed by the ORB are now
        -ORBsvcconf <filename>    specifies the service configurator
                                  file to be used
        -ORBdaemon                turn this into a daemon
        -ORBdebug                 turns debugging on in the service
                                  configurator

        BOA_init() now sets the itself in the TAO_OA_Parameters singleton.

        * tao/orbobj.*: Changed client_factory(), server_factory(), and
        params() to return pointers rather than references.

        * tao/{roa,giop}.cpp: Updated code that uses the
        CORBA::ORB::client_factory() to deal with the fact that it now
        returns a pointer rather than a reference.

        * tao/default_server.cpp (init): This method now properly
        initializes the contained reactive and threaded strategies so that
        they're actually usable!

        * tao/connect.cpp: Added #endif comments.

Wed Aug 13 17:42:39 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/*: Converted to the CORBA:: namespace.

        * tao/default_server.h: Eliminated a few strategy accessors since
        they aren't provided by this implementation.

        * tao/default_server.cpp: Made this compile.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Slight reformatting of code.  More importantly,
        added 'static' to the decl of ORB_init().

        * tao/corba.h: Added fake comment to trigger C++ mode.

        * tao/any.h: Added #endif comments.

Tue Aug 12 22:37:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{any,typecode,cdr}.h: Finished appeasing the compiler gods
        so that we can remove the ACE_INLINE hack.  Things now seem to be
        in order.

        * tao/corba.h: Got all the frigging header *.i files #included in
        the right order so that the GCC compiler stops complaining.

        * tao/giop.cpp: We had method definitions that were defined inline
        within the giop.h file.  This was causing problems for GCC, which
        kept warning that methods in the cdi.i file were being used before
        being inlined.  I've fixed this by creating a giop.i file.

        * tao/corba.h: Add #include files should be prefixed by "tao/".
        I've fixed this in the release.

Tue Aug 12 16:23:17 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/any.i: Added a missing replace() method used by overloaded
        operators.

        * tao/{any,cdr}.h: Added conditional ACE_INLINE before the decl
        for a few methods whose usage in other inlined methods appears
        prior to their definition.

        * tao/default_client.cpp: Eliminated names of unused arguments to
        stop the compiler from complaining.

        * tao/server_factory.cpp: Properly scoped return type names for
        several methods.

        * tao/{typecode,decode,deep_copy,debug}.cpp: Bracketed unused
        variables with #if defined(TAO_NEEDS_UNUSED_VARIABLES)/#endif;
        this leaves them around for right now in case they're important.

        * tao/client_factory.i (connector): Properly scoped return type's
        name.

        * tao/{client_factory,default_client}.cpp: Added necessary
        template instantiations.

        * tao/{typecode,cdr}.h: Added conditional ACE_INLINE in front of
        inlined methods to appease the compiler gods.

        * tao/boa.cpp (dispatch): Declared argument unused to get rid of
        warnings.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Moved #include of sequence.h before the decl for
        class CORBA.

Sun Aug 10 10:58:21 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/client_factory: Moved the template specializations from the
        *.cpp file into the *.i file in order to get this stuff to link
        without multiply defined symbols.  Thanks to Brian Mendel for
        giving me the idea to do this.

        * tao/client_factory.cpp: Added a template specialization for
        ACE_Hash_Addr.

Sun Aug 10 08:56:20 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * CORBA_ to CORBA:: transformation complete. All the files in the
        TAO/tao distribution have been affected. The most notable changes
        are:
        (1) A file called "tao/corba.h" is now the master file. All *.cpp
        files include *just* this file and nothing else.

        (2) "tao/corbacom.h" is the file that defines the CORBA namespace
        i.e., class CORBA. Individual CORBA classes such as TypeCode, BOA,
        etc are now defined inside the CORBA namespace. This will allow
        users and developers to use CORBA::TypeCode as opposed to the
        previous CORBA_TypeCode. Instead of nesting the classes, however,
        we use typedefs to define individual CORBA classes inside class
        CORBA e.g., typedef CORBA_TypeCode TypeCode;

        (3) All *.i files are included at the end of "tao/corba.h" and
        nowhere else. However, if __ACE_INLINE__ isnot defined, then each
        individual *.i file is not yet included in their corresponding
        .cpp file. This will be done next.

        * TAO/tests/Demux_Test: Included code that tests various
        demultiplexing strategies in TAO. At this point, however, the code
        will not work because of changes in TAO. This will be done
        next. A README file provides additional details.

        * TAO/Benchmark: A suite of benchmarking tests have been
        included. This is still in the preliminary stages of
        development. The idea is to compare various aspects of CORBA such
        as marshaling overhead, demux costs, throughput, latency, and
        others for a range of ORBs including TAO. Since there are
        differences in programming different ORBs, this suite tries to
        abstract out all the common features or atleast provide a uniform
        interface so that minimal efforts are required to port an
        application from one ORB to another.

        Benchmark/benchmark: This directory contains thecommon features
        Benchmark/Marshal_Test: Tests marshaling overhead in 3 ORBs -
        Orbix, VisiBroker, and TAO. More will be added. There are a few
        problems getting DSI to work. The tech support at IONA and
        VisiBroker have been contacted.

Sat Aug  9 14:05:08 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Continued to clean up all the code so that it is more
          consistent with ACE programming style.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Cleaned up a lot of the unnecessary #defines.

        * tao/default_server.h: Make sure we inherit from
          TAO_Server_Strategy_Factory, not TAO_Server_Factory.

        * tao/server_factory.cpp: Moved all the inline methods to be
          non-inline since this code will always be dynamically bound.

        * tao/client_factory.cpp: Cleaned things up a bit.

Sat Aug  9 12:37:05 1997  Brian Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/corba.h:  Deleted include for xdr.h from corba.h.  xdr.h
        is obsolete.

        * tao/objtable.cpp:  Deleted pragmas for instantiating ACE_Guard,
        ACE_Read_Guard, and ACE_Write_Guard to eliminate duplicate
        instantiations.  The templates are instantiated by ACE.  Can these
        templates also be removed from the
        ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION section as well?

        * tao/default.bld: Added build file for VxWorks.

        * tao/tao.bld: Added build file for VxWorks.

Fri Aug  8 14:25:20 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.*: Updated various methods to use the new
        dynamically-linked strategy factories discussed below.

        * tao/default_client.*: This file now contains the default client
        strategy factory which is (a) dynamically linkable by the service
        configurator and (b) can be configured by flags passed in via
        service configurator.

        * tao/client_factory.*: This file now contains the abstract base
        class for the client strategy factory.

        * tao/default_server.*: This file now contains the default server
        strategy factory which is (a) dynamically linkable by the service
        configurator and (b) can be configured by flags passed in via
        service configurator.

        * tao/server_factory.*: This file now contains the abstract base
        class for the server strategy factory.

        * tao/params.*: Renamed DEMUX_STRATEGY enum to TAO_Demux_Strategy
        and put it at global scope instead of within TAO_OA_Parameters.

        * tao/svc.conf.eg: Created this file to serve as an example of
        various lines one might find in an application's svc.conf.

Thu Aug  7 09:51:31 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * factories.cpp: Incorrect use of ACE_ASSERT in
        TAO_Server_Factory::object_lookup_strategy removed.

        * objtable.cpp: The octet sequence object key was being cast into
        a char* resulting in undefined behavior at times due to the lack
        of a NULL character to terminate it. Changes were made in the bind
        and find methods of TAO_Active_Demux_Table.

Thu Aug 07 03:52:31 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.8, released Thu Aug 07 03:52:31 1997.

Thu Aug  7 00:43:14 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/typecode.cpp: A couple of errors involving TAO_CONST crept
        in when Brian checked in his code.  I fixed these.

Wed Aug  6 18:28:41 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@swarm.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/clnt.cpp (main): Corrected the format
        specifications when timing was printing out from %ld to %d.  For
        some reason this never caused a problem on other platforms.

Wed Aug  6 17:27:44 1997  Brian R. Mendel  <brian.r.mendel@boeing.com>

        * tao/typecode.h: Removed qualified name in typecode.h to eliminate
          compiler warnings by the GHS compiler.  Line 297.

        * tao/decode.cpp: Changed wchar_t* to CORBA_WChar* to eliminate
          compiler errors on GHS compiler.  Lines 142, 216, 729, 1371, and 1475.

        * tao/typecode.cpp: Deleted unreachable break statements at lines
          429, and 477, 904, and 947.

Wed Aug  6 16:31:29 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@swarm.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/*: Changed 'const' to 'TAO_CONST' in contexts where the
        const didn't make sense.  For example, this occurred in situations
        where methods declared their return type as 'const CORBA_String',
        which does not translate to 'const char*' but rather 'char*
        const'.

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added #define for TAO_CONST.  See above for
        explanation.

        * tao/{connect,factories,giop,iiopobj,marshal,objtable,
        optable,orbobj,roa}.cpp: Removed errant trailing semi-colon on all
        the #pragma instantiate directives.

Wed Aug  6 13:56:40 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{connect,factories,giop,iiopobj,marshal,objtable,
        optable,orbobj,roa}.cpp: Changed explicit template instantiations
        to use the new ACE enabling macro as well as adding the #pragma
        instantiate to placate Edison Design Group compilers.

        * tao/cdr.h: Changed default for CDR CTOR marshal factory to
        reflect the new name of the default marshal factory variable.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp (CORBA_ORB_init): Inserted call to
        TAO_Marshal::initialize().

        * tao/marshal.*: Added TAO_Marshal class to scope static
        initialization methods for the marshalling engine.
        TAO_DEFAULT_MARSHAL_FACTORY has moved inside of this.

Sun Aug  3 13:12:03 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO: Continued to improve the formatting of these
        tests.

Sat Aug  2 13:55:40 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO: Cleaned up some of the formatting so that
        it is easier to read.

Thu Jul 31 16:19:43 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h: Removed incorrect #include "tao/corba.h" in this
        file.  Bad form.

Thu Jul 31 15:19:43 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/*.{h,i,cpp}: Changed all #include of specific
        header files to include the application-level "tao/corba.h".

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/Makefile (BIN): Removed test1_svr and test1_clnt
        for now until we can get them working again.  They stopped working
        after the BOA API changed and the non-standard get_request()
        method removed.

        * tao/any.h: Inserted #includes which insure that this header file
        is not position-dependent on other header files.

        * tao/corba.h: Created this catch-all header file for APPLICATIONS
        to use as a single entry point.  Currently it just includes all
        TAO header files, but will eventually be pared down to only those
        headers which warrant public exposure.

Wed Jul 30 16:55:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/typecode.i (CORBA_TypeCode): Re-ordered member
        initialization to correspond to declaration order.

        * tao/{typecode,orbobj,optable,decode,cdr}.cpp: Added explicit
        typecast to CORBA_ULong/unsigned long to eliminate warnings about
        comparisons btw. signed and unsigned entities.

        * tao/optable.cpp (bind): Put in explicit return type for
        TAO_Active_Demux_OpTable::bind().

Wed Jul 30 14:18:02 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile: Corrected automatic definition of TAO_ROOT and
        fixed all dependencies on tao header/inline files.

        * tao/{typecode,object}.i: Moved a few methods to the beginning of the file
        so that the compiler KNOWS that they are inlined when it hits the
        first reference to them later in the file.

        * tao/object.cpp: Added an end-of-line to silence a very picky SGI
        compiler.

Wed Jul 30 10:05:38 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/connect.cpp: Removed a number of explicit template
        instantiations that are already included in ACE.

Wed Jul 30 14:20:18 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/boa.{i,h,cpp}: Removed the #include of "tao/objtable.h" and
        instead moved the methods that needed it from boa.i to boa.cpp

Wed Jul 30 13:58:02 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/boa.h: Added #include of "tao/objtable.h" since it is needed
        in boa.i (which is included here when inlining is turned on)

Wed Jul 30 10:05:38 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/boa.h: Removed the #include of "tao/objtable.h" which seems
        to be unnecessary and may cause problems for template
        specialization.

        * tao/iiopobj.i (IIOP_Object): Changed the second parameter to the
        IIOP_Object constructor so that we can is a const
        IIOP::ProfileBody &.  This prevents a compiler warning.

        * tao/typecode.cpp (private_id): Removed unused variable status.

        * tao/objtable.cpp (bind): Removed the temp variable, which
        was unused.

Tue Jul 29 19:31:11 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/boa.cpp (get_boa): Added casts of ACE_UINT32 so that we
        don't have ambiguous calls to the constructor of ACE_INET_Addr.

        * tao/deep_copy.cpp (deep_copy): Removed an unreachable return
        value.

Mon Jul 21 15:08:36 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.7, released Mon Jul 21 15:08:36 1997.

Mon Jul 21 12:06:16 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/object.cpp: removed the #include of object.i since it will
        always be #included in object.h

Thu Jul 17 16:54:38 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.6, released Thu Jul 17 16:54:38 1997.

Thu Jul 17 16:43:23 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{optable,objtable}.cpp: Updated the explicit template
        instantiations at the end of these files to reflect the changes
        that Andy made.

Thu Jul 17 10:08:45 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/align.h: A very subtle error in "align_binary" was corrected. I
        was assuming that align_binary is always called by
        "ptr_align_binary". In the original inline function versions of
        align_binary and ptr_align_binary, the function align_binary would
        subtract 1 from the specified alignment that ptr_align_binary
        provided. Since I assumed that "align_binary" would always be
        called by "ptr_align_binary", I subtracted the 1 in
        ptr_align_binary and passed the result to "align_binary". This
        caused all sorts of problems for application code that directly
        called "align_binary". This error has been fixed. The macros for
        align_binary and ptr_align_binary are now exactly as the original
        inline functions.

        * tao/any.{h,cpp}: Added comments. In addition, in the code for
        Any::replace, we check if "_value" exists before trying to
        DEEP_FREE it. Otherwise this was resulting in a segmentation fault
        violation.

        * tao/boa.{h,i}: Added comments and changed "release" to CORBA_release

        * tao/cdr.{h,cpp}: Added some comments and removed some stuff that was
        under #if 0 .. #endif

        * tao/corbacom.h: Added lots of comments for the CORBA_String_var class

        * tao/decode.cpp: Made TAO_Marshal_Union::decode to work, added comments.

        * tao/encode.cpp: Made TAO_Marshal_Union::encode to work, added comments.

        * tao/factories.{h,cpp}: Added lots of comments. Removed "void
        object_lookup_strategy" method since we do this in the parameters
        class. Added code that will use a user defined lookup strategy if
        the corresponding flag is set. This needs to be tested.

        * tao/iiopobj.{i,cpp}: In the allocation and deallocation of the buffer
        for object key, we now use "new/delete" instead of "malloc/free".

        * tao/interp.cpp: commented out a line that decremented 4 from the
        offset provided for indirected typecodes. I guess this was plain
        hack to get some broken things to work.

        * tao/objtable.{h,cpp}: Added lots of comments. Added code that will use
        template specialization for the dynamic hashing case. In addition,
        improved the destructors of the classes since previously, these
        were not releasing occupied memory.

        * tao/optable.{h,cpp}: Added lots of comments. Added template
        specialization for dynamic hashing scheme. Made dynamic hashing
        scheme the default. Added a new definition for "struct
        TAO_operation_db_entry". The idea is that an IDL compiler will
        generate a database of operations and their corresponding
        skel_ptrs. Such a database is now passed to teh constructors of
        the operation lookup tables. This way, only one instance of such
        lookup tables can be shared by any number of objects implementing
        the same interface.

        * tao/params.{h,i,cpp}: Made dynamic hashing the default. Added a hook
        by which users can supply their lookup strategies. *Needs testing*.

        * tao/typecode.{h,i,cpp}: Added comments and many changes. The private
        state's constructor now takes an argument that is a TCKind
        representing the TypeCode kind of the object of which we are the
        private state. Removed "child_free". Instead, we introduced a
        destructor for the private state that frees all the
        children. Another important change is to the constructor of the
        TypeCode class. We pass a "parent" pointer, if any, to the
        constructor. All children typecodes will share the octet buffer of
        the parent. Only freestanding typecodes will allocate octet
        buffers. We have a new data member called "non_aligned_buffer_"
        because the buffer we allocate may not be aligned on a 4 byte
        boundary. As a result, we may start using the buffer at a shifted
        position to the right. However, we do not want to lose a handle to
        the original buffer that was allocated because at the time of
        freeing, this pointer needs to be freed.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO: Modified a few files (method_db.i, cubitS.cpp)
        so that they use the modified optable and objtable classes. Added
        a README file to indicate how to run the example.

        * tests/Thruput_test: Modified virtually all the files to make it
        work with the latest TAO release and its include files. Also,
        changes similar to Cubit were necessary due to changes in the
        objtable and optable classes.

Wed Jul 16 14:17:01 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/params.*: Eliminated unnecessary
        ACE_LACKS_STATIC_DATA_MEMBER_TEMPLATES checks from
        TAO_OA_Parameters (unnecessary b/c it's not a template).  Also
        corrected the type of TAO_OA_Parameters::ace_singleton_lock_.

Wed Jul 16 11:34:36 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/boa.cpp: Removed some unused code.

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Added explicit check for prior inclusion
        of ace/OS.h, with an error being produced if it's not included.
        This will help keep me honest and remember to always include OS.h
        beforehand, since I do most of my development on non-WIN32
        platforms.

        * tao/*.{h,cpp}: Added #include "ace/OS.h" before every inclusion
        of <objbase.h>.  This is required on WIN32 platforms because
        objbase.h eventually ends up including <winsock.h>, which is the
        wrong version of winsock from what ACE requires.  Thus, by
        including OS.h prior to objbase.h, objbase.h ends up not trying to
        include a winsock header.

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Added missing #include for tao/debug.h.

Wed Jul 16 10:55:55 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/PC_Install.bat: removed it since it isn't needed anymore

        * tao/TAO.dsp: Changed include path and removed calling of
          PC_Install.bat

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/{client,server}.dsp: Changed include path

Tue Jul 15 16:13:53 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/cubitC.cpp: Added missing calls to Release()
        after QueryInterface() calls.  The tip-off that this wasn't
        happening was the fact that, upon client exit, there were upwards
        of 15 references to the object references.  Now it's only 5-7
        (more work to go).

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/*: Changed all #include paths to be "tao/...".
        Also, changes to orb.h (see below) obviated additional header
        inclusion in certain files.

        * tao/compat/*.h: Changed the guts of these files so that they
        work more like their "real" counterparts in the VC++ 5.0.  This
        should encourage compatibility.  Note that, unlike the previous
        files, objbase.h MUST be included before initguid.h; this is
        consistent with the model on WIN32.

        * tao/*.{h,cpp}: Changed all #include paths to be "tao/...".
        Also, changes to orb.h (see below) obviated additional header
        inclusion in certain files.

        * tao/giop.cpp: Removed get_request() crufty old code.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: Backed out many prior special-code additions
        for defining IIDs.  Hopefully the need for these is negated by
        changes elsewhere in the "compat" files.

        * tao/object.cpp: Corrected the conditional compilation switch
        used to determine if we define IID_IUnknown.  This now happens
        whenever WIN32 isn't defined, instead of before when it was only
        on unix or vxworks platforms.

        * tao/Makefile: Eliminated the need to copy files into a "proto/"
        directory; now, everything is built into and used from the "tao"
        directory.

        There is also a new, optional, environment
        variable--TAO_ROOT--which should be set to the ".../TAO"
        directory.  If it's not set, the Makefile will set it to
        $WRAPPER_ROOT/TAO.

        Lastly, libcorba.* has changed to libTAO.*.

        * tao/orb.h: Eliminated many header files which had been
        explicitly included here and were causing all manner of problems
        with circular includes.  Library components must now be careful to
        include appropriate headers for all components they use, and we
        will likely have to create a corba.h file for clients to use.

Fri Jul 11 12:12:40 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp: changed to use ace-r.dll in the release
          version

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/{client,server}.dsp: changed to use ace-r.dll
          and tao-r.dll for the release versions.

Thu Jul 10 15:47:24 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/: Removed the following obsolete files: README.apm,
        BUILDING, and TESTS.

        * tao/params.*: Moved the instance() methods into the .cpp from
        the .i, as well as the declaration for the singleton locks.
        Having the singleton locks declared in the .i file caused much
        consternation when ACE inlining was turned on.

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: #ifdef'd the IID_STUB_Object declaration added
        a few days ago so that it happens one way on NT, and another in
        the rest of the Universe.  I would have preferred to find a more
        general solution, but didn't find one quickly enough to satisfy my
        current requirements.

        * tao/roa.*: Removed get_request() method.  This should improve
        our McCabe scores ;-)

        * tao/boa.h: Removed get_request() method.

Wed Jul  9 14:44:31 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO-Install: Added installation instructions for NT

Tue Jul  8 20:52:06 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/PC_Install.bat: Made it very quiet.

        * tao/params.{cpp,h,i}: Changed TAO_OA_PARAMS from a
          ACE_Singleton to a plain singleton by just integrating the
          ACE_Singleton code into the class.

Tue Jul  8 14:27:47 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/except.h: added ACE_Svc_Export to SYSEX macro

        * tao/iiopobj.cpp: changed declaration of IID_STUB_Object
          to include ACE_Svc_Export

        * tao/stub.h: added ACE_Svc_Export to IID_STUB_Object

Tue Jul  8 12:44:14 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Put the "*" in before the comment since it is
          supposed to be there.  Put a space between it and the comment
          to get rid of the warning which VC was giving originally.

Tue Jul  8 10:21:27 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/typecode.cpp: Changed a few loop counters from int to
          CORBA_ULong to get rid of unsigned/signed comparison warnings

        * tao/orbobj.cpp: Got rid of a "*" before a comment.  Looked like
          a typo

        * tao/PC_Install.bat: Replaced "#...." with "rem ...."

Mon Jul  7 20:59:05 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/test1_{svr,clnt}.cpp (main): Added template
          specialization code and updated the formatting.  Thanks to Arturo
          Montes <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/test1_svr.cpp (main): Added the -i options to
          getopt().  Thanks to Arturo Montes <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for
          reporting this.

        * TAO/tao/orbconf.h (SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE): Added a
          #define for M_UNIX.  Thanks to Arturo Montes
          <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

Sun Jul 06 02:37:24 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.5, released Sun Jul 06 02:37:24 1997.

Sun Jul  6 00:10:28 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: Fixed all the code so that we put ACE_MT around all the
          ACE_GUARD_RETURN macros.

        * tao: Updated all of TAO to make sure we use [] when deleting
          arrays in order to avoid memory leaks.  This looks like lots of
          sloppiness left over from the original SunSoft IIOP code.

Sat Jul  5 16:12:31 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/{any,iiopobj,nvlist,principa,request,roa,svrrqst,typecode}.cpp:
          Fixed a double-deletion of a lock.

        * tao/typecode.i: Cleaned up lots of minor warnings with the code
          that are only revealed when running GCC.  The code should now
          compile almost completely cleanly with -wall.

        * tao/typecode.{i,h}: Changed the name of TC_PRV_State to
          TC_Private_State.

        * tao: Replaced ACE_Thread_Mutex with ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that the
          code will compile on non-threaded and threaded platforms alike.

        * tao/marshal.cpp: Added template specializations for the Marshal
        primitives.  Thanks to Arturo Montes <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for
        reporting this.

        * tao/Makefile (LDLIBS): Replaced -lcorba with -lACE so that we no
        longer have problems with circular link dependencies.  Thanks to
        Arturo Montes <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

Sat Jul 05 13:25:23 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.0.4, released Sat Jul 05 13:25:23 1997.

Sat Jul  5 12:39:57 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao: All throughout TAO I removed the direct use of system
        include files in lieu of using ace/OS.h.

        * tao/{orbobj,typecode}.cpp: orb.h must be included before others
        include files. Previous includes prevent correct use of ACE config
        flags, therefore, I removed them.  Thanks to Arturo Montes
        <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

        * tao/{debug,roa}.cpp: changed _POSIX_THREADS to ACE_HAS_PTHREADS.
        Thanks to Arturo Montes <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting
        this.

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode): The casting (CORBA_ULong) kind is
        unnessary and wrong so I removed it.  Thanks to Arturo Montes
        <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

        * tao/debug.cpp (emit_prefix): Changed line 99 from

        #define emit_prefix (stream) ...

        to

        #define emit_prefix(stream) ...

        The blank character prevent after macro name (emit_prefix) prevent
        correct definition.  Thanks to Arturo Montes
        <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

Sat Jul  5 01:04:24 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/xdr.cpp: Removed unistd.h and string.h from the xdr.cpp
          file since those aren't necessary.  Thanks to Arturo Montes
          <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.

Fri Jul  4 00:18:21 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/roa.h: Removed derogatory COMments ;-).  Thanks to Anton van
          Straaten <anton@appsolutions.com> for reporting this.

Thu Jul  3 16:16:14 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added ACE_Svc_Export to a couple of declarations to make NT
          happier

Thu Jul  3 13:43:20 1997  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added Visual C++ 5.0 project and workspace files for the TAO
          library and Cubit test

Wed Jul  2 12:44:42 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests: Moved tests from TAO/IIOP/tests to TAO/tests

Wed Jul 02 00:20:28 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Compiled the first alpha release of TAO on Solaris just
          to make sure it still works.  So far, so good... hence,
          the first alpha release is out the door!

Tue Jul  1 23:35:53 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * VERSION: Added a VERSION file, starting at version 0.0.0...

Tue Jul  1 23:00:15 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added a new tests directory with the Cubit and TTCP
        examples. The older test directory will be deleted soon.

        In addition, the tc_constants in the tc_constants.cpp  file are
        declared with an ACE_Svc_Export to make the Win NT compiler
        happy. Extern declarations in typecode.h had the same changes.

        * Updated the PC_install.bat file. In addition, there was one more
        warning in typecode.cpp (Win NT compiler) that was fixed. Finally,
        in the the tc_const.cpp file, the ACE_Svc_Export was used
        accidently. This has been fixed.

        * A number of files were updated with ACE_Svc_Export so that
        variables and classes do not remain unresolved for Win32
        platform. Similarly, Irfan had sent me a list of warnings that the
        Win NT compiler was giving. These are fixed.

        * marshal.*: Changed the way make_marshal_object works. Instead of
        having a switch statement, we index into a private table of
        marshal objects using the TypeCode _kind field. MarshalFactory now
        maintains this private table.

Mon Jun 30 17:39:02 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added a new README file and a COPYING file that explains the
        contents of TAO and clarifies its copyright status.

Sun Jun 29 10:06:50 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * marshal.*: Added CORBA_Environment as a parameter to
        make_marshal_object factory method. The reason for doing this was
        to enable inlining of the CDR::encode and CDR::decode methods.

        * typecode.*: Changed the way typecodes get deleted. Constant
        typecodes are now owned by the ORB and their private state freed
        when the ORB dies. IDL generated typecodes are not owned by the
        ORB and are the only ones whose refcount matters. Typecodes
        belonging to the IDL generated typecodes are also not owned by the
        ORB and there is no effect on their refcount. They get freed only
        if the parent is destroying itself.

        In typecode.i, methods such as length and content_type were not
        getting inlined due to presence of switch statements. Converted to
        if/else.

        * interp.cpp: Bug fix: Had previously forgotten to update the
        size/alignment of the private state of the typecode.

Fri Jun 27 14:27:49 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * any.cpp: The deep_copy and deep_free optimizations applied. In
        the previous release, I had forgotten to add these to the Any
        constructor (that calls deep_copy) and Any destructor/replace
        (that call deep_free).

        * connect.cp, factories.cpp: Added code that hardcodes the socket
        buffer sizes to 64K. This is a hack for the time being.

Thu Jun 26 10:02:47 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Some more progress on IDL compiler. Generates the client and
        server side files without much contents in it.

Thu Jun 26 09:49:38 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added a full range of optimizations to the TAO IIOP interpretive
        marshaling engine. The static methods encoder and decoder have
        been removed from the CDR class. Instead, separate classes for
        marshaling have been created for each individual data type. The
        CDR stream maintains a factory that returns an appropriate
        marshaling object depending on the data type to be
        marshaled. Files added include marshal.h, marshal.i, encode.cpp,
        decode.cpp, deep_free.cpp, and deep_copy.cpp. The marshal.h file
        defines classes for an abstract MarshalObject. The factory is
        responsible to return a concrete specialized instance of the
        MarshalObject.

        * Updated the CORBA_TypeCode class so that it now provides all the
        CORBA_2.0 compliant operations. These include length(),
        content_type(), member_type(), member_label(),
        discriminant_type(), id(), default_index(). The equal() operations
        is still not implemented. In addition, precomputation
        optimizations are applied to the TypeCode class. This includes
        precomputing various parameters (if any) of a TypeCode. For
        example, a struct TypeCode keeps track of the member count and
        member types. As a result, it is not necessary to interpret the
        CDR encapsulated stream to retrieve these parameters.

        * At this time, there are some problems getting the Unions to work.

Thu Jun 12 15:45:49 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.cpp: Added explicit template instantiations
        for ACE_Hash_Map_Manager<>.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.*: Finally got rid of all those methods that took
        ACE_HANDLE as the argument.  Now, all those operate on
        ACE_SOCK_Streams.

Thu Jun  5 10:15:21 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Corrected output format in error message.

Thu Jun  5 10:09:01 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/svr.cpp: Added a new class to catch SIGINT and
        terminate.  This was necessary to Quantify the server process.

        * IIOP/lib/orbobj.h: Added ACE_INLINE to forward decls of
        CORBA_release() and CORBA_is_nil().

Wed May 23 14:39:01 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.{h,cpp}:  Added template specialization of
        ACE_Hash_Map_Manager for char*'s.

        * IIOP/test/cubitS.cpp:  Fixed type_id to be of type CORBA_String_var.
        Also, added a debug msg to print the object address to show the
        object for which the request is made.

        * IIOP/test/svr.cpp:  Added capability to create multiple Cubit
        objects via command line options.  Added -n for number of objects and
        -k for specifying a base name.  For instance, -k Beevis -n 2 creates
        Beevis1 and Beevis2 objects.  The clnt can then specify a specific
        object for the request as usual.

Wed May 22 12:28:45 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * IIOP/test/clnt.cpp:  Deleted VxWorks specific sections.  Command
        line is now working for VxWorks.
        * IIOP/test/svr.cpp:  Deleted VxWOrks specific sections.  Command line
        is now working for VxWorks.

Wed May 22 11:31:42 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/svr.cpp: Added better error checking and messages, and
        performed general re-formatting.

        * IIOP/test/method_db.i (initialize_method_db): Changed arg type
        to use a pointer to the abstract class TAO_Operation_Table.

        * IIOP/test/cubitS.cpp (_skel_Cubit::_skel_Cubit): Added better
        error checking and messages.  Also defaulted to use the linear
        object table implementation rather than the hashed to simplify
        debugging.

        * IIOP/test/clnt.cpp: Moved some code around so that more of the
        code is common is less is specific to VxWorks and other platforms.
        Also did general re-formatting.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.cpp (TAO_Linear_OpTable::find): Initialization
        of the loop variable makes the loop work properly.

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.cpp (TAO_Dynamic_Hash_ObjTable::find):
        Explicitly specified length of object key in CTOR for ACE_CString
        because object keys are not zero-terminated.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Added newlines to the end of all ACE_DEBUG()
        messages.

        * IIOP/lib/factories.cpp: Added template specializations for
        ACE_Hash_Addr<ACE_INET_Addr, TAO_Client_Connection_Handler>.

Tue May 22 09:32:41 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * IIOP/lib/cdr.h: Deleted #define old_value ACE_INLINE and
        #define ACE_INLINE old_value lines. Added #undefs for ACE_INLINE
        prior to redefines.  Changes required to compile on Windows NT.

Tue May 20 14:47:46 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/cubitS.h: Removed forward decl of
        TAO_Active_Operation_Table.

        * IIOP/test/{cubitC,cubitS}.*: Changed include quoting characters
        from [<>] to double-quotes.

        * IIOP/test/Makefile: Removed cubit.o from clnt and svr target
        (this has been subsumed by cubit[CS]).

        * IIOP/lib/optable.h: Changed ACE_RW_Mutex to ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.cpp: Inserted explicit template instantiations.

        * IIOP/lib/Makefile: Added optable to the Makefile.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.cpp: Moved ~TAO_Operation_Table() into here.

        * IIOP/lib/object.i: Moved find() and bind() into the cpp file.
        Moved ~TAO_Operation_Table() into optable.cpp.

Tue May 20 14:39:00 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * IIOP/test/*: Commited changes to Cubit Example as a current snapshot
          of required changes.

        * IIOP/lib/*: Changes required for header file includes.  Added
          conditionals around _IIOP_BUILD_

Tue May 20 13:55:58 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/*: Commited this stuff in-process so that Brian
        M. doesn't have to duplicate effort.

Tue May 20 13:04:00 1997  Brian Mendel <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * IIOP/lib/debug.cpp: Deleted spaces between flockfile (f) and
        funlockfile (f).  Changed instances of debug_filter to
        TAO_debug_filter.  Deleted space between emit_prefix (stream).

        * IIOP/lib/cdr.cpp Added undef(s) for ACE_INLINE and
          do_undef_on_ACE_INLINE to eliminate redefinition problems.


Tue May 20 10:55:09 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/cdr.h: Fixed the automatic inclusion of cdr.i into
        cdr.h by checking to see if __ACE_INLINE__ is not defined and, if
        so, defining ACE_INLINE to be "inline" (we tidy up the namespace
        immediately after the inclusion of cdr.i, too).  See source for
        comments regarding why this is done.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.cpp (TAO_Linear_OpTable_Entry): Removed setting
        of opname and skel_ptr to zero in CTOR since the CTOR for those
        already insures this.  Moreover, NT's compiler was complaining
        about ambiguous resolutions.

        * IIOP/lib/{orbobj,giop,debug,boa}.cpp: Fixed reference to
        debug_level so it's TAO_debug_level.

        * IIOP/lib/object.h: Replaced inclusion of optable.h with forward
        decl of TAO_Operation_Table.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.cpp: Fixed names of methods that were changed
        in the header but never changed in the source.  Amazing that
        neither g++ nor Sun C++ caught these gaffs!  (Finally, the NT
        compiler wins).

        * IIOP/lib/{orbobj,object}.h: Changed the forward decls of
        CORBA_release() and CORBA_is_nil() so that they are only in effect
        when inlining is NOT being used.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Fixed incorrect passing of an object to
        ACE_DEBUG() where an int is expected.

Mon May 19 17:16:34 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Explicit cast rids us of a warning.

        * IIOP/lib/params.h: Fixed CTOR name.  Once again I'm surprised
        G++ didn't catch this.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.h: Corrected erroneous method signature on
        bind().

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.cpp: Corrected erroneous method signature on
        TAO_Linear_ObjTable::bind().

        * IIOP/lib/{object,orbobj}.h: Forward declaration of
        CORBA_release(CORBA_Object_ptr) and CORBA_is_nil(CORBA_Object_ptr)
        were commented out.  I think this will cause a problem when we
        DON'T inline, but I'll cross that bridge later.

        * IIOP/lib/{orb,factories}.h: Made inclusion of some headers
        conditional on the compilation phase (building the library or an
        application).

        * IIOP/lib/cdr.i: Removed incorrect default arguments (g++ didn't
        catch them).

        * IIOP/lib/Makefile: Removed thread from the header list.

Mon May 19 10:07:00 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/optable.cpp: Changed implementation of the operation
        table and the parameters repository so that they use the right
        class names.

Sat May 17 17:18:38 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * First pass at providing a backend to the SunSoft's CORBA IDL
        compiler front end.

Fri May 16 17:30:31 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/svrrqst.*: Corrected some comments, adjusted some
        argument type names to reflect their new, namespace-sanitized
        names, and moved short methods into a new inline file.

        * IIOP/lib/stub.h: Corrected some comments and adjusted some
        argument type names to reflect their new, namespace-sanitized
        names.

        * IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Corrected syntax error and fixed up typedef.

        * IIOP/lib/params.*: Removed extraneous comments and fixed
        argument type on demux_strategy().

        * IIOP/lib/orbobj.*: Added comments, removed static pointer to
        the ORB.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.h: Removed extraneous comments and fixed
        typedefs.

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.cpp: Fixed some syntax errors introduced by
        reformating.

        * IIOP/lib/object.cpp: Adjusted some argument type names to
        reflect their new, namespace-sanitized names.

        * IIOP/lib/invoke.cpp: Removed crufty #includes and adjusted some
        argument type names to reflect their new, namespace-sanitized
        names.

        * IIOP/lib/iioporb.*: Moved short methods into inline file, added
        IIOP_ORB_ptr typedef, and changed data member to conform to ace
        standards.

        * IIOP/lib/iiopobj.*: Added the second CTOR that I forgot last
        time and adjusted some argument type names to reflect their new,
        namespace-sanitized names.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.h: Added comments for various enums and
        structures.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Switched various GIOP::Invocation methods to
        use handler_->peer() for socket communication rather than going
        through a file descriptor.  Also began the arduous (no other word
        could explain it!) process of converting the homegrown debugging
        message macro uses into ACE_DEBUG() uses.

        * IIOP/lib/factories.*: Added explicit DTOR for TAO_Client_Factory
        and completed all the darn explicit template instantiations.
        Changed 'Svc_Handler' to 'TAO_Client_Connection_Handler', and
        added the forgotton TAO_Client_Factory::connector() method.

        * IIOP/lib/debug.*: Added 'TAO_' prefix to global debug state
        variables and removed crufty #includes.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.cpp: Change ROA_Handler to
        TOA_OA_Connection_Handler (missed these the last time through).

        * IIOP/lib/cdr.cpp: Added responsive commentary.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Added comments to the dispatching code.

        * IIOP/lib/{any,boa,request,typecode}.cpp: Removed references to
        thread.h/connmgr.*.

Thu May 15 19:08:16 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Finished updating all the reformatting.

Thu May 15 15:54:49 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/principa.h: Corrected syntax error which eliminated the
        _refcount data member.

        * IIOP/lib/{params,roa}.*: Updated class names to reflect ROA -->
        TOA_OA pseudo-namespace change.

        * IIOP/lib/orbobj.*: Updated CORBA_ORB_init() to return pointer to
        new ORB singleton.

        * IIOP/lib/orb.h: Commented out some include files to eliminate
        wierd circular dependencies.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.h: Moved TAP_Operation_Table into here.  Put
        OpTable* classes into the TAO_Operation_Table* pseudo-namespace.

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.*: Moved TAO_Object_Table into here.  Moved
        the Entry classes out of the scope of their respective concrete
        operation tables, so they're now named <concrete_table>_Entry.

        * IIOP/lib/object.*: Moved TAO_Operation_Table into optable.*, and
        added a data member which carries a pointer to the ORB with which
        the object is associated.

        * IIOP/lib/iioporb.*: Added a singleton typedef for the ORB which
        is what CORBA_ORB_init() will now return.  Modified
        string_to_object() so that it sets the ORB on the CORBA_Object
        that it returns.

        * IIOP/lib/{iiopobj,nvlist}.h: Added some responsive commentary.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Modified connection establishment code in
        GIOP::Invocation::start() to utilize the client connection manager
        in the ORB.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.h: Put a TAO_Client_Connection_Handler* into
        GIOP::Invocation in place of the client_endpoint.

        * IIOP/lib/factories.*: Updated explicit template instantiations,
        added TAO_Client_Connection_Handler.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.*: Renamed things--ROA_Parameters -->
        TOA_OA_Parameters, ROA_Handler --> TOA_OA_Connection_Handler.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.h: Moved TAO_Object_Table into objtable.*, added
        comments where appropriate.

        * IIOP/lib/{any,cdr,iioporb,invoke}.*: Re-formatting and creation
        of inline method file.

Tue May 13 21:51:22 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Continued to update the format of the TAO source code so that it
          will be consistent with the style used in ACE.

Mon May 12 17:02:29 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/roa.*: Moved short method into an inline file.
        Miscellaneous reformatting.  Adjustment to new type names
        (prefaced by TAO_ for namespace protection).

        * IIOP/lib/object.*: Moved short methods into an inline file.
        Changed lookup()/register_op() to find()/bind() for consistency
        with established ACE APIs.  Miscellaneous reformatting.

        * IIOP/lib/iiopobj.*: Moved short methods into an inline file.
        Added CTOR for IIOP::Version and IIOP::ProfileBody.  Added
        convenience CTOR for IIOP_Object where the profile can be
        supplied.  Miscellaneous reformatting.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.*: Moved short methods into an inline file.  Changed
        lookup()/register_obj() to find()/bind() for consistency with
        established ACE APIs.

        * headers: Added comments to force C++ mode in emacs for header
        files, and changed SCCS version tag info to RCS version tag info.

Wed May  7 14:49:46 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/corbacom.cpp: Some bugs from the CORBA_String_var class
        have been fixed. Thanks to Brian Mendel for noticing these.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: In CORBA_BOA::dispatch, the opname local
        variable of type CORBA_String_var is changed to be of type
        CORBA_String. This was because the String_var class would assume
        ownership of the quantity assigned and delete it. Thanks again to
        Brian Mendel for noticing this.

Tue May  6 14:06:49 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/boa.hh: the register_obj's 2nd argument is changed from
        CORBA_Object_ptr& to CORBA_Object_ptr

        * IIOP/lib/object.hh: the return type for register_op method on
        CORBA_Object is changed from void to int to be consistent.

        Added a new method "get_subclass" to CORBA_Object that returns a
        pointer to the subclass. Typeically, this would be pointer to an
        object that implements an interface.

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.{hh,cpp}: @nd argument of register_obj changed
        from CORBA_Object_ptr& to CORBA_Object_ptr.

        * IIOP/lib/orb.hh: the type signature of "skeleton" is changed to
        take CORBA_Object_ptr rather than CORBA_Object_ptr& as its 2nd argument.

Mon May  5 20:28:54 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: commented out code that uses the "void
        *context" field. It doesn't make any sense to have it.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.hh: Added 2 pure virtual methods (shutting_down and
        clean_shutdown).

        In addition, the "register_obj" method was added. It was missing before.

        * IIOP/lib/corbacom.cpp: String_var's constructor bug is fixed. It
        was trying to free storage that was never allocated.

        * IIOP/lib/iiopobj.{hh,cpp}: Added a method - "get_name" that
        retrieves the object name.

        * IIOP/lib/object.{hh,cpp}: Added a method - "get_name" that
        retrieves the object's name or key. This is for debugging purposes.

        * IIOP/lib/orbobj.cpp: There was an infinite loop in parsing the
        options to BOA_init. Fixed.

        * IIOP/lib/stub.hh: Added the "get_name" virtual method.

Sat May  3 22:45:23 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Added code temporarily that invokes the
        skeleton that is looked up. We still need to add code that will
        handle the case when no match is found on the operation names.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.hh: The register_obj method on TAO_Object_Table
        now returns an integer indicating status of registering (-1 =>
        failure, 0 for success).

        * IIOP/lib/object.hh: The register_op method on
        TAO_Operation_Table now returns an integer code (O for success, -1
        for failure).

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.{hh,cpp}: The register_obj method returns an
        integer code representing either success or failure.

        * IIOP/lib/optable.{hh,cpp}: Added new files that implement
        concrete strategies for operation name lookup.

Fri May  2 08:48:29 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/object.hh: Modified the signature of register_op on
        TAO_Operation_Table to take a second argument to be a pointer to
        the actual skeleton.

        Thanks to Brian Mendel for reporting this.

Thu May  1 16:46:11 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/object.{hh,cpp}: Added a method that can set the parent
        pointer.

        * IIOP/lib/params.cpp: A hook has been provided in ROA_Factory to
        enable the user to use a user-defined demux strategy.

Wed Apr 30 22:00:51 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/objtable.{hh,cpp}: Added two new files that define
        different object demultiplexing strategies.

        * IIOP/lib/Makefile: Added objtable as additional source file to compile.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Provided the default destructor for the
        TAO_Object_Table.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Provided the default destructor for the
        TAO_Operation_Table.

        * IIOP/lib/orbobj.cpp: Added support for the -OAtablesize option
        in the call to CORBA_ORB::BOA_init method.

        * IIOP/lib/params.{hh,i,cpp}: Added support to ROA_Factory to return
        a specific object lookup strategy.

        *IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: The ROA constructor initializes its "objtable_"
        private data member with the object lookup strategy returned by
        ROA factory.

Tue Apr 29 11:52:48 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/any.hh: Moved CORBA_Any_ptr declaration to orb.hh.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.{hh,cpp}: Renamed BOA to CORBA_BOA. The CORBA_BOA class
        maintains a pointer to an abstract TAO_ObjectTable class. Concrete
        classes inheriting from TAO_ObjectTable will provide strategies
        for lookup.

        Added virtual functions to do dispatch based on object key. In
        addition, added a lookup method based on object key that delegates
        the task of looking the object to the object table it maintains.

        Changed the signature of typedef CORBA_BOA::dsi_handler to be pointer to
        member function of class CORBA_BOA. Eventually, this will point to
        the dispatch method of class CORBA_BOA.

        Moved "struct Dispatch_Context" from roa.hh to boa.hh since we
        want BOA to be a full fledged OA eventually and not remain an
        abstract class as it is now. All other OA's such as ROA inherit
        from BOA and only add extra functionality.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.cpp: There was a syntax error (missing comma)
        in one of the ACE_DEBUG statements which has been fixed.

        * IIOP/lib/corbacom.{hh,cpp}: Added class CORBA_String_var as well
        as the CORBA compliant CORBA_string_dup.

        * IIOP/lib/except.hh: Moved CORBA_Exception_ptr declaration to orb.hh.

        * IIOP/lib/object.hh: Added an abstract class
        TAO_Operation_Table. CORBA_Object maintains a pointer to this
        abstract class. The IDL compiler will eventually generate concrete
        classes that employ different lookup strategies for operation name
        lookup.

        * IIOP/lib/orb.hh: Added forward declarations to all CORBA_*
        classes. In addition, moved all the CORBA_*_ptr declarations here.

        * IIOP/lib/orbobj.{hh,cpp}: Added the CORBA compliant BOA_init
        method to class CORBA_ORB. Users can now pass arguments to
        BOA_init. Eventually, we want to make this method return any of
        the specialized OA's depending on the arguments. Right now, we get
        a pointer to the ROA.

        * IIOP/lib/params.{hh,i}: Added some more methods and enum
        declarations to the ROA_PARAMS singleton.

        * IIOP/lib/principa.hh: Moved the CORBA_Principal_ptr declaration
        to orb.hh.

        * IIOP/lib/roa.{hh,cpp}: Moved some functionality to boa.hh. ROA
        is now only a specialized form of BOA.

        * IIOP/lib/stub.hh: Moved the typedef for "skeleton" to orb.hh.

        * IIOP/lib/svrrqst.{hh,cpp}: Had to rename BOA to CORBA_BOA.

        * IIOP/lib/typecode.hh: Moved the CORBA_TypeCode_ptr declaration
        to orb.hh.

Tue Apr 22 23:30:19 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/connect.cpp (open): Added log message.

        * IIOP/lib/params.cpp (concurrency_strategy): Uses reactive
        strategy when appropriate.

        * IIOP/lib/params.hh: Reactive strategy added.

Tue Apr 22 21:03:15 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Changed erroneous ACE_GUARD calls to ACE_GUARD_RETURN
        calls.

Tue Apr 22 16:15:52 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Removed more POSIX thread calls.

        * IIOP/lib/invoke.cpp: Changed ForceSynchronousCancellation to
        ACE_Synchronous_Cancellation_Required and made it use the ACE_OS
        calls.

        * IIOP/lib/{typecode,svrrqst,request,principa,orbobj,nvlist,iiopobj,giop,except,any}.*:
        Removed all vestiges of pthread mutexes...they are now
        ACE_Thread_Mutexes.  This will likely have to change if we want to
        compile something completely devoid of threads, but that's another
        day.  Also, the mutexes have moved from being globals to being
        members on the respective classes.  No files should be dependent
        on thread.hh any longer.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.cpp (open): Removed code obsoleted by use of
        the Strategy_Acceptor.

        * IIOP/lib/{roa.cpp,connect.cpp},IIOP/tests/svr.cpp: Changes to
        use new singletons described below.

        * IIOP/lib/params.*: Changed ROA_Parameters and ROA_Factory to use
        ACE_Singleton<>.  The singleton types are now named ROA_PARAMS and
        ROA_FACTORY.

Mon Apr 21 23:44:34 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/lib/roa.cpp (ROA): Changed spelling of clientAcceptor_ to
        client_acceptor_ to be consistent with ACE style conventions.

Mon Apr 21 10:52:42 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/clnt.cpp: Moved call to CORBA_ORB_init() prior to the
        parsing of the command line args.  This got switched around during
        porting to VxWorks.

        * IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Changed calls using clientAcceptor_to use APIs
        vended by ACE_Strategy_Acceptor.

        * IIOP/lib/roa.hh: Moved default thread flags into ROA_Factory.

        * IIOP/lib/params.*: Added ROA_Factory, a singleton which is the
        beginning of an abstract factory dynamically producing runtime
        strategies based on information found in ROA_Parameters.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.cpp: Added call to ROA_Handler's base class
        CTOR in initializer list.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.hh: Changed ROA_Handler's CTOR so that it can
        take an optional ACE_Thread_Manager* arg.  This makes it
        compatible with the CTORs for the base class.  Also changed base
        class for ROA_Acceptor to ACE_Strategy_Acceptor.

        * IIOP/lib/svrrqst.*: Changed references to BOA_ptr from TOA_ptr.

        * IIOP/lib/connect.*: ROA_Handler/ROA_Acceptor moved from roa.*
        into here.

        * IIOP/lib/params.*: ROA_Parameters moved from roa.* into here.

        * IIOP/lib/boa.*: What used to be TOA is now BOA, and lives in
        here.

        * IIOP/lib/roa.*: Major restructuring required removal of all
        classes (see other log entries) from here.  This file now houses
        only the ROA class.

        * IIOP/lib/{tcpoa.*,toa.*}: Removed because of name changes from
        TCP_OA->ROA and TOA->BOA.

Fri Apr 18 08:09:19 1997  Brian Mendel   <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * cdr.hh,corbacom.{hh,cpp},giop.cpp,marshall.cpp,typecode.cpp:
        Changes required for WChar missed in earlier committed code.

        * connmgr.cpp: Changes required for select statement.

        * nvlist.cpp: Conditional include for memory.h added.  VxWorks
        does not have memory.h.

        * object.cpp: Added conditional for VXWORKS to define
        IID_IUnknown.

        * orbconf.hh: Minor tuning of the configuration file.

        * tcpoa.{hh,cpp}: Added VXWORKS conditional includes.

        * toa.cpp: Added VXWORKS conditional includes.


Mon Apr 15 17:01:00 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

        * roa.cpp: Added return statement to ROA_Handler::open(void*)
        method.

        * giop.cpp: Modified giop::read_buffer to replace undefined fc
        with peer.get_handle().  Modified giop::incoming_message method
        parameter list to match function prototype exactly.

        * tcpoa.cpp: Replaced fd instances in debug messages with
        peer.get_handle() calls.

Mon Apr 14 13:45:54 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * roa.{hh,i,cpp},tcpoa.cpp,svr.cpp: Replaced ACE_ROA with
        ROA_Parameters, which is a GoF-style singleton.

Sun Apr 13 00:01:56 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * roa.cpp: Fix continuation condition in ROA_Handler::svc()'s loop
        so that it doesn't stop after one iteration.  Also added some
        debug messages.

        * giop.cpp: Fixed some returns being called with no value.  This
        should have been caught in the previous round of changes.

Sat Apr 12 23:10:08 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tcpoa.{hh,cpp}: TCP_OA::handle_message() now returns a value
        indicating how a message was handled.

        * roa.cpp: ROA_Handler::handle_input() now returns a meaningful
        value based on what TCP_OA::handle_message() returns.

        * giop.{hh,cpp}: Added end-of-file detection on socket
        connections, and that is now propagated all the way back up
        through GIOP::incoming_message().  I don't know if I violated
        something in the spec by doing this, but it was necessary.  I'll
        look into it later.

Thu Apr 10 11:49:44 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * giop.{hh,cpp}: Overloaded all methods dealing with connections
        so that there are two, one taking a file descriptor as argument,
        the other taking an ACE_SOCK_Stream.  Right now, the *_Stream
        version simply forwards to the fd-based one.  I would have
        preferred to get rid of the fd-based methods altogether, but we've
        only converted the server runtime; the client is still using the
        original sun code, which is effectively fd-based.  In the course
        of doing this, I also simplified the decls for incoming_message by
        creating typedefs for some of the function pointers passed as
        args.

        * orbconf.hh: Fixed the stupid auto-endian-ness detector
        AGAIN...had my logic reversed!

        * roa.cpp: Adjusted code in accordance with changes to tcpoa.hh.

        * tcpoa.hh: Moved and renamed TCP_OA::dispatch_context to be
        ::Dispatch_Context, and changed its endpoint member to be an
        ACE_SOCK_Stream.

        * roa.hh: Fixed handle_input() to use the underlying peer() data
        member for reading data, rather than using its argument.  This is
        so that when a different thread handles each connection,
        handle_input() can simply be called repeatedly by svc().

Wed Apr  9 16:19:21 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tcpoa.cpp: Fixed a problem that G++ didn't notice regarding
        changing the notion of endpoints in servers from server_endpoint
        to an ACE_HANDLE.

Wed Apr  9 15:43:37 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * svr.cpp: The -p option is gone, and -e takes its place and is
        required.  This requires the user to specify not only the port
        number, but also the IP address of on which the server should
        listen for requests.  See ACE_INET_Addr documentation for valid
        string formats for addresses.  Also, the -t option sets the "use
        threads" global.

        * orbconf.hh: Hopefully resolved the tension between MS and Unix
        platforms in inferring endian-ness of the target platform based on
        preprocessor defines.  We now check for i386, _M_X86, and vax
        (yeah, like we really worry about that, but it's easy to do).

        * roa.{hh,i,cpp}: Added support for spawning threads to handle
        incoming requests.  This involves a state flag for whether or not
        to use threads, calling activate() in ROA_Handler::open() if that
        flag is set, and creating ROA_Handler::svc() that simply loops
        calling handle_input().

Tue Apr  8 11:14:57 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/svr.cpp: Moved setting of upcall(), forwarder(),
        context(), etc. into here rather than in TCP_OA::TCP_OA(), which
        is where I mistakenly stuck them a few days ago (duh!).

        * IIOP/lib/tcpoa.cpp: Removed setting of ACE_ROA::upcall(), which belongs
        in the server code.  I got confused because the function names
        were so similar: tcpoa.cpp contains ::tcp_oa_dispatcher(), and
        svr.cpp contains ::tcpoa_dispatch().

        * IIOP/lib/roa.{hh,i,cpp}: Added forwarding function to ACE_ROA global namespace
        hack.

        * IIOP/lib/orbconf.hh: Fixed preprocessor checks that auto-detect
        endian-ness of this processor.

Mon Apr  7 21:08:24 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/test/test1_{clnt,svr}.cpp: THESE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO
        USE ACE EVENT HANDLING!!  This round of changes explicitly
        instantiates templates where required.

        * IIOP/test/svr.cpp: Global function ::OA_listen() no longer
        exists; its functionality is now fully contained within ::main().
        If USE_ACE_EVENT_HANDLING is defined, a Reactor-based event loop
        is used.  The original intent was to allow conditional compilation
        to select btw. the original method and a Reactor-based method.
        However, weaving that into the library proved far more difficult
        than anticipated, so more than likely not defining
        USE_ACE_EVENT_HANDLING will cause massive grief.

        * IIOP/lib/toa.cpp: Changed call to TCP_OA::init() to reflect new
        ACE_INET_Addr argument type.

        * IIOP/lib/tcpoa.cpp (TCP_OA): All initialization methods were
        changed, specifically the CTOR and TCP_OA::init, to reflect the
        introduction of ACE_INET_Addr.  Two side-effects of using
        ACE_INET_Addr are that (1) a server can specify the address on
        which it wants to listen and (2) best that I can tell, the server
        MUST specify the address on which it wants to listen because
        otherwise it won't be able to publish a rational IOR.  The event
        loop is now changed to simply loop on Reactor::handle_events().

        * IIOP/lib/tcpoa.hh (TCP_OA): Removed vestiges of this component's
        use of the original connection management scheme.  Where
        appropriate, hostnames and ports were replaces by ACE_INET_Addr,
        endpoints by ACE_HANDLEs, etc.  One particularly nasty thing done
        was to declare ROA_Handler as a friend so that handle_message()
        can be called from ROA_Handler::handle_input(), which to me
        exposes a hole in the original architecture wherein input is
        "pulled" rather than waited-for.  We might need to re-think how
        this is handled within TAO.

        * IIOP/lib/roa.{hh,i,cpp}: These files contain the required
        components to support the new server-side ACE-based
        connection/event substrate.  The client side remains, as always,
        using the connection mgmt scheme used by the original Sun IIOP
        code.

        * IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Added explicit template instantiation for
        when this is needed.

        * IIOP/lib/corbacom.hh: Now protects itself from multiple
        inclusion.

        * IIOP/lib/Makefile: Added roa.* where appropriate.

Wed Mar 19 10:25:21 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP/docs/us/codecount/*.count: Added to repository.

        * Makefile: Added to repository.

        * IIOP/objbase.h: Moved to IIOP/compat.

        * IIOP/initguid.h: Moved to IIOP/compat.

Thu Mar 13 14:06:28 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ChangeLog: Added the ChangeLog.
