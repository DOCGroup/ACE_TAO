        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Repository.h:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Repository.cpp:

          Removed the config_ member variable.  Config is already
          stored in the Options object, so we can just get it from
          there.  This also allows for better memory management, since
          the config_ will live its whole life in Options.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Repository.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Options.cpp:

          Cleaned up the code a bit to fit more with the code style
          guidelines.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.h:

          Repaired the memory management to do clean up better.  Things
          now aren't duplicated unnecessarily and are removed from the
          reactor.          
          
          Also added a fini () method to ImplRepo_i, which separates the
          cleanup associated with the init () from that associated with
          the constructor.  Thanks to Sandro Doro <doro.s@flashnet.it>
          for noticing this.

Fri Jun  2 20:31:45 2000  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/tests/Notify/lib/Makefile:
	  added -lTAO_CosNotification -lTAO_CosNaming in Makefile to fix
	  linking errors on Compaq Tru64 UNIX

Fri Jun  2 15:33:08 2000  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated the Notify section with
	  information on project schedule.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp:

          Removed the ACE_INLINE from the Client::func method definition.

Fri Jun 02 02:23:42 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp (TAO_Delayed_Buffering_Sync_Strategy::send):

	* tao/UIOP_Transport.cpp (TAO_UIOP_Transport::send):
	* tao/SHMIOP_Transport.cpp (TAO_SHMIOP_Transport::send):
	* tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (TAO_IIOP_Transport::send):

	  The recent changes to the send_n()/recv_n() methods in ACE was
	  causing a problem in tests/Timed_Buffered_Oneways.  The problem
	  was that the code was expecting information about partial
	  transfers to come through the return value.  Information about
	  partial transfers now comes through the <bytes_transferred>
	  parameter.  So the fix included expanding send() methods in TAO
	  to have the additional <bytes_transferred> parameter and
	  changing the algorithm to look at the correct place for partial
	  bytes transfers.

Thu Jun  1 18:42:29 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Interface.pidl:
	* tao/InterfaceC.h:
	* tao/InterfaceC.cpp:
	  Fixed a typo in the OMG IDL listing for Interface
	  Repository (in Components vol. III). The operation
	  Container::create_interface is missing a parameter.

	* tao/TAO.dsp:
	* tao/TAO_Static.dsp:
	  Added IORC.i to these project files.

Thu Jun 01 03:04:20 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

Wed May 31 12:34:54 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Any.h:
	* tao/Any.i:
	  Changed the insertion/extraction operators for Any_var
	  to pass a reference to the Any_var as the lhs.
	  Otherwise a copy of the Any_var is made, which is
	  inefficient at best and, when the rhs is a pointer
	  type, the operation would fail.

Wed May 31 12:17:20 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/Alt_Resources/Resource_Factory.cpp:

	  The implementation of this alternative resource factory had
	  become obsolete with recent changes.  The new method to
	  override is allocate_reactor_impl().

Wed May 31 10:04:18 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TradingLib.dsp:

          The configurations were missing a space after the dash, which
          wasn't a problem in DevStudio, but the msvc_auto_compile script
          had problems with it.

Wed May 31 09:50:34 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/any_op_cs.cpp:
	  Cosmetic cleanup I forgot to do on my last checkin.

	* tests/Timed_Buffered_Oneways/client.cpp
	* tests/Timed_Buffered_Oneways/test_i.cpp

	  Using <TAO_debug_level> to control the application level
	  debugging output is not a good idea since turning on
	  <TAO_debug_level> results in the TAO library also producing
	  unnecessary debugging output.

	  As far as the auto compile output being too noisy is concerned,
	  note that the auto compile output is immaterial in determining
	  the success of an execution.  Execution success is determined by
	  a script that looks for process crashes, exceptions, etc.
	  Actually it is useful to have the execution output since
	  execution might be OS/compiler/host-load specific which might be
	  hard to reproduce specially for MT programs.

	  Owners of other tests and examples may want to revert Carlos's
	  changes if application level debugging output is important to
	  them.

Tue May 30 20:58:17 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/cdr_op_ci.cpp:
	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/any_op_cs.cpp:
	  In the CDR extraction operator for interfaces,
	  replaced _narrow with _unchecked_narrow, to
	  eliminate remote calls to _is_a when foo's
	  child is marshaled as a foo_ptr. Also eliminated
	  the call to _narrow in the Any extraction operator.
	  The temporary CORBA::Object_var was eliminated as
	  well - the stream now extracts directly into the
	  rhs argument. All this is safe because, in a
	  marshaling situation, the type of the object must
	  be either the type specified in IDL or a derived
	  type, else there would have been a compile-time
	  error. And the Any extractor checks for typecode
	  equivalency before proceeding with the extration.
	  Thanks to Francois Bernier <fbernier@gel.ulaval.ca>
	  for pointing out this use case.

Tue May 30 11:14:51 2000  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/run_test.pl
          orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/run_test.pl

          Added -ORBSvcConf option to run on Chorus.

Tue May 30 10:25:29 2000  Michael Kircher <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

	* tao/POA.pidl: Removed a dupliate declaration of CORBA::Policy,
	  CORBA::PolicyType and CORBA::PolicyList. It is duplicated because
	  orb.idl includes Policy.pidl, which declares these already besides
	  other things.

Mon May 29 22:38:29 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* examples/Simple/time-date/server.cpp:

	  Added missing "ace/Log_Msg.h" include.  This fixes a compile
	  error with Sun C++.

Mon May 29 16:56:24 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* utils/NamingViewer: Added some fixes to the NamingObject.{h,cpp}
	  and NamingTreeCtrl.cpp files.  Thansk to Thaddeus Olczyk
 	  <olczyk@interaccess.com> and Chris Hafey <chafey@stentor.com>
 	  for reporting/fixing this.

Mon May 29 14:21:24 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/POA.cpp:

	  - All calls to add_ref() and remove_ref() on the servant must be
	  treated as a non-servant upcall since the user can override
	  these methods.  The POA must be ready to handle recursive calls
	  from these methods.

	  - Added TAO_POA_Guard, a new helper class.  This class makes
	  sure that the lock is properly acquired, that the POA is not
	  being destroyed, and the no non-servant upcalls are currently in
	  progress.

	* tao/Object_Adapter.cpp:

	  - Moved wait_for_non_servant_upcalls_to_complete() to the
	  Object_Adapter from Servant_Upcall.  This way other classes
	  (e.g., the POA) can also call this method.

	  - Changed the use of TAO_POA_GUARD to TAO_OBJECT_ADAPTER_GUARD.
	  TAO_POA_GUARD is now exclusively reserved for the POA.

	  - In servant_cleanup(), <servant_deactivation_condition>
	  broadcast should be done after the servant cleanup is complete.
	  Otherwise, the an awaiting thread may get to check for servant
	  deactivation when the POA lock is temporarily released for
	  _remove_ref() in the servant cleanup.  At this time the servant
	  entry is still in the active object map and the awoken thread
	  will get an untimely wakeup.  However, if the broadcast if done
	  afterward the servant cleanup, the awaiting thread will get the
	  correct and timely wakeup.

	* tao/Exception.cpp: Added TAO_GUARD_FAILURE and
	  TAO_POA_BEING_DESTROYED for exception location encoding.

	* tests/POA/Non_Servant_Upcalls: New test to check the users
	  ability to make calls on a POA during non-servant upcalls.  In
	  this example, a servant which is being destroyed during because
	  of a deactivate_object() call, tries to deactivate another
	  object in its destructor.

Mon May 29 09:56:45 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

	* docs/releasenotes/index.html:
	  Put a date back into the 'current status:' line. The
	  section itself is up to date - it's only the date that's
	  out of date ;-). Thanks to William Horn
 	  <whorn1984@my-deja.com> for bringing this to our attention.

	  Updated comment.

Sat May 27 01:07:01 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_Core.h:

          Removed the semicolon after the macro usage, since it was moved
          into the macro itself.  This should get rid of a unneeded
          semicolon warning.

Fri May 26 21:04:38 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* docs/releasenotes/index.html: Removed the mention of the

          explicitly initialize virtual base classes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies, the binaries where not included in the

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:
          Removed .in() from two things that weren't _vars in
          create_exception_tc - the same change that was made
          to create_struct_tc a few days ago.

Thu May 25 12:14:06 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/TypeCodeFactory_i.h:
          Cosmetic changes.

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:
          Added create_union_tc() method. Every feature has not
          been tested with every discriminator type, but enum
          discriminators have been thoroughly tested, as well
          as default cases and multiple case labels. Recursive
          typecodes (structs and unions) are not yet supported.

          in TAO_Marshal_Union. Thanks to Tom Ziomek <tomz@cc701.comm.mot.com>
          for reporting these leaks and sending in the example code that
          helped track them down.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp (DRV_parse_args): There was a
          bunch of busted code that must have resulted when removing %a.
          Thanks to Yiu L. Lee <yiulee@crosskeys.com> for reporting this.

Mon May 22 17:48:30 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
          Added two missing options to the 'usage' ouput -
          -H perfect_hash       (force perfect hashing. Even
                                 though it's the default, I
                                 guess someone might want to
                                 use it just to remind themselves)
          -d                    (output a dump of the AST)

          -Gsp                  (changed existing -Gs typo to -Gsp)

        * docs/compiler.html:
          Added -d option mentioned above and removed -Gi option
          (interpretive marshaling - no longer used in IDL compiler).
          Also added -Sv option to suppress valuetype support.
          Thanks to Ossama for pointing these out.

Mon May 22 13:57:45 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        These changes were necessary to get the CORBA Security Service IDL
        to compile, however they also apply to other IDL files that
        include <orb.idl>.

        * tao/POA.pidl:

          Moved "Identifier" and "RepositoryId" typedefs to
          `tao/orb.idl'.  These typedefs are not specific to the POA, and
          they are needed by some services, such as the Security Service.

          Include <orb.idl> to pull in the moved typedefs.

        * tao/CORBA.pidl:

          Moved contents of this file to `tao/orb.idl' since types in this
          file must be available to CORBA applications that include
          <orb.idl>, and since CORBA.pidl is not a standard IDL file.

        * tao/orb.idl:

          This file now contains the core CORBA typedefs necessary to
          compile most, CORBA IDL files that depend on them.

           symbols from Compaq cxx.

          2.95.1 on Solaris.  pid_t is a long on (32-bit) Solaris,
          so %ld should be used for it.

        * tests/IDL_Test/constants.idl:
          Removed the signed long constant I added earlier today.
          I got warnings from at least 3 compilers and an error
          from SunCC 4.2, just as the original bug report says.
          Even though 'long foo = -2147483648' is legal according
          to ANSI, hardly any platforms deal with it flawlessly.
          I don't believe it's an IDL compiler bug.

        * tests/IDL_Test/constants.idl:
          We got a bug report of an IDL compiler error when given a
          signed long constant with the minimum value. I'm curious
          because a fix was checked in for this almost a year ago,
          but it's not included in IDL_Test (which was written later),
          and probably wasn't tested on every platform. I think it may be a
          preprocessor problem. Anyway, I've added that constant to
          this file, to see what the various platforms/compilers
          have to say. If it is indeed a preprocessor problem, it
          may have to be removed later. Thanks to Sam Cooper
          <Sam.Cooper@scisys.co.uk> for reporting the bug.

        * docs/ORBEndpoint.html:

          Fixed typos in IIOP endpoint examples, and clarified that quotes
          should be used when specifying more than one endpoint option, or
          whenever any option is used with an UIOP endpoint.  Quotes are
          needed to prevent the shell from interpreting some characters as
          shell commands.  Thanks to Steve Totten <totten_s@ociweb.com>
          and Irfan for noticing these problems.

          pluggable protocols IIOP, SHMIOP and UIOP.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/marshal_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/rettype_marshal_ss.cpp:
          When (de)marshaling bounded (w)strings, the IDL compiler
          was subtracting 1 from the bound value. Since the bound
          value does not include the terminating null, this was
          incorrect. Thanks to Russell Mora <rd.mora@router.econz.co.nz>
          for reporting this bug.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:
          Moved the generation of the destructor and default
          constructor for interfaces out of the *C.i file and
          into the *C.cpp file. Earlier changes to prevent a
          widening _var assignment created problems with
          aggessively inlining compilers in the case where an
          interface is forward declared, and has a child which
          is forward declared earlier.

Wed May 17 20:57:49 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp:

          The using std::set_unexpected needed to be used in Borland,
          so I changed the #if guard around it to check for _MSC_VER
          instead of ACE_WIN32.

Wed May 17 12:11:17 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

Wed May 17 12:30:33 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:
          Added a missing case (wchar) to switch statement used to
          compute a valid value for the default case label. I was
          looking through IDL code trying to figure out how to
          write TypeCodeFactory_i::create_union_tc and I found
          this by accident.

Tue May 16 16:48:23 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:
          create_struct_tc had '.in()' applied to a couple of things that
          weren't even pointers, let alone _vars. It was causing a C++
          exception on NT. How this could have escaped all our compilers
          all this time I have no idea.

          Changed the Time Offset constant to 141427 days
          (0x2D8539C80 secs) instead of 141426.97 days
          (0x2D8539260 secs). I have put comments in the code on why

          Moved the call to addr_to_string() inside the debug level

          connected to for debugging purposes.

        * tao/UIOP_Connect.cpp (open, handle_close, handle_close_i):

          UNICODE related updates.  Wrap debugging messages within

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface_fwd/interface_fwd_ci.cpp:
          If an interface is forward declared, we now generate as
          much inline code as possible at that point, saving only
          the generation of members' inline code for the full
          definition. Since the be_interface_fwd node contains
          a reference to its full definition node, we can set the
          cli_inline_gen flag in that node as well, to avoid redundant
          code generation. Recent changes to generated _var code
          for interfaces have made all this necessary. Agressively
          inlining compilers like cxx now need to see the _var code
          sooner if the forward declared interface is used as an arg
          or a member before it is fully defined.

Mon May 15 14:20:38 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp (operator>>):

          Improved the "could not create all profiles" error message by
          stating that the problem could be related to address resolution
          failure (e.g. DNS).  Also added a comment discussing when the
          problem may occur.  Thanks to David for suggesting that the
          error describe the problem a bit more.  The previous message was
          an implementation detail that isn't generally useful to end
          users.

          Note that this error message should no longer be displayed, at
          least not due to any address resolution problem since address
          resolution, in the case of IIOP, has been delayed until
          connection establishment is initiated.  In the case of an
          address resolution problem, a CORBA::TRANSIENT() exception
          should be thrown.

          The Policy_Manager_Impl object increases the reference count of
          the special policies before returning them (just like normal
          policies).
          These two changes fix the last portion of [BUGID:322], the code

          The addition to the _var copy constructor in the entry below
          must have perturbed the delicate balance of compiler
          happiness. Now it seems g++ wants a local name instead of
          a scoped name for the next line.

Fri May 12 12:13:46 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/varbase.h:
          Added new file varbase.h and included it in corbafwd.h. This
          new file contains a base class declaration for the object _var
          classes called TAO_Base_var. Declaring (but not implementing)
          a private copy constructor and assignment operator that takes
          a reference to this base class as the rhs will cause a compile-
          time error if a "widening assignment" happens - when a var of
          a derived interface is assigned to a var of its ancestor. This is
          what we want, the CORBA spec forbids it.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface_fwd.cpp:
          Changes to generate the declarations mentioned above in the
          *C.h files, as well as a call to the var base class default
          constructor in the initialization of the var copy constructor

          Suppress generation of Any operators automatically when
          typecode generation is suppressed with -St, since the
          >>= operator uses the typecode. The use of -St along was
          generating incompilable code.

Thu May 11 09:00:00 2000  Michael Kircher  <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * tests/AMI/ami_test_i.cpp, tests/AMI/ami_test_i.h: Added the user
          exception DidTheRightThing to the throw spec of the servant
          implementation. This fixed bug 521.  The problem was that the
          servant implementation did not enumerate the exception in the
          throw spec. The server raised the system exception instead of
          the given user exception, which lead at the client to the
          conclusion that it demarshalled the exception wrongly.  The
          compilers should have complained about throwing an user
          exception when only system exceptions were allowed in the throw
          spec.

            Sat Apr 29 15:24:03 2000  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

          SYNC_DELAYED_BUFFERING has the value -1; -1 and 255
          (TAO_TWOWAY_RESPONSE_FLAG) are the same for octets.  Hence the
          server started sending unexpected replies to the client causing
          problems.  Previously, TAO_TWOWAY_RESPONSE_FLAG was 131 and
          hence there was no conflicts.  I changed SYNC_DELAYED_BUFFERING
          to have the value -2.  It only took two whole days to figure
          this out ;-)

          This batch of changes focus on propagating the "localness" up
          and down of AST structures.  For example, if one of the element
          in a struct is local, then the whole struct is considered local.
          IDL constructs finished in this stage are sequence, struct,
          union, and exception.

          The code generation for local operations no longer uses special
          internal states to differentiate local vs. remote operations.
          This information is now embedded in the syntax tree.

          It's now illegal for a remote operation to have an argument of
          local type.

          Known issues:  Local arrays needs to be revisited to make sure we
          generate the minimum code required.  Also, an array of a local
          type is also local.  This is currently not 100% implemented.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated the release info about
          local interfaces.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp: Modified the tree generation to propagate
          localness info to operations, operations arguments, and
          attributes.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_generator.h:
        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_generator.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_generator.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp: Modified the factory methods to
          take in local and abstract info for Field, Operation, Attribute,
          and Array.  (Need more work on Array type.)  Plus some cosmetic
          changes.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_array.h:
        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_array.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_operation.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_operation.cpp: Modified constructors to pass in
          local and abstract info.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_typedef.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp: Localness of typedef is determined by
          both the enclosing scope and the type the typedef maps to.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_field.cpp: The default localness and abstractness
          of a field (within a struct) or a branch (within a union) are
          determined by the type of this field.  Initialize them according
          to the type info passed in.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_structure.h:
        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_structure.cpp:  Moved methods <member_count>,
          <compute_member_count> and their supporting data from backend
          into their common baseclass ast_structure.  Also moved the
          <is_local> method from be_structure to ast_structure.  It's
          recursive semantics is required by all structure derived types.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_factory.cpp: Removed all *_LOCAL_*
          states and changed to use the local information embedded in the
          syntax tree.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_ami_pre_proc.cpp:  The contructor
          signature for be_operation has changed.  Changed to create all
          AMI related opeations as remote interfaces.  Some AMI interfaces
          can probably be implemented as local interfaces and we might
          want to work on that later on.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype.cpp:  Like AMI
          interfaces, all valuetype operations are considered to be remote
          here.  However, their code are generated by valuetype visitors
          so the local information is not used there.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp: Supressed visitors
          for these constructed types from generating code for CDR, Any,
          and Typecode if they are "local."

Wed May 10 11:59:35 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTEvent:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTOLDEvent:
          The OLD event channel code has been moved to a separate library,
          that means that applications can link only the code that they
          require.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecBase.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTSched:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.RTSchedEvent:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.Svc_Utils:
          Decouple the RT Event Service from the scheduling service.
          To do this some of the shared code was moved to a small idl file
          in Svc_Utils.
          The RT Event Service still supports the scheduling strategies,
          but they are in a separate library, so not all applications have
          to compile or link the scheduling service library.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/old_event_export.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/sched_event_export.h:
          New export macros for the OLD event channel library and the
          scheduling service library.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Utilities.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Utilities.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Utilities.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf_Anomalies.cpp:
          Use the new RtecBase module instead of RtecScheduler.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.cpp:
          The default factory cannot create any of the scheduling related
          strategies anymore, the new EC_Sched_Factory can do that.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp:
          The Event Channel stores the pointer to the scheduling service
          as a CORBA::Object, so there is no need to link the scheduling
          service code.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_Sched.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_Sched.cpp:
          Separate the gateway in two versions, one supporting scheduling
          and one without need of scheduling.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Sched_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Sched_Factory.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Sched_Factory.cpp:
          New factory that can create the scheduling strategies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Priority_Dispatching.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Priority_Scheduling.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Sched_Filter_Builder.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Scheduling_Strategy.h:
          Use RtecBase instead of RtecScheduler
          Also use the new TAO_RTSchedEvent_Export macro.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/BCU.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ReactorTask.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.h:
          Use the new TAO_RTOLDEvent_Export macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Makefile:
          Only link the RTEvent library, RTSched is not needed anymore
          except for the Schedule test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Schedule.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Schedule.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/sched.conf:
          Use the new EC strategy factory in this test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/lib/Driver.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/lib/Driver.cpp:
          Only one test creates the scheduling service, so there is no
          sense in having support for in in the base Driver class.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Observer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Gateway.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.h:
          More changes from RtecScheduler to RtecBase

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Makefile:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/lib/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Makefile:
          More makefiles changed to take advantage of the this change.

Wed May 10 13:51:45 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
          Changed the error messages generated by an incorrect option
          to something more understandable, as suggested by Chris
          Cleeland <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>. Also replaced the use of
          cerr with ACE_ERROR.

          out.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_defn.cpp:
          Fixed an inconsistency in the value of a flag for
          optimizing the repo id field of the generated
          typecode. I turned off this particular optimization
          a while back because of a sponsor request, and
          because it wasn't buying us much anyway, but I
          missed a spot. Thanks to Chris Cleeland
          <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>, whose question about
          reducing the size of generated code led me to look
          at this file again.

Tue May  9 20:01:41 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.h (TAO_Acceptor_Registry):
        * tao/Connector_Registry.h (TAO_Connector_Registry):
        * tao/ORB_Core.h (TAO_ORB_Core, TAO_ORB_Core_TSS_Resources,
                          TAO_TSS_Resources, TAO_ORB_Table):
        * tao/Pluggable.h (TAO_Transport):
        * tao/Profile.h (TAO_Profile):
        * tao/Resource_Factory.h (TAO_Protocol_Item):

          Declared the copy constructor and the assignment operator to be
          private and unimplemented.

        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.cpp (open):

          Removed assignment from ACE_CString to temporary `const char *'
          pointer.  The temporary wasn't necessaery since the ACE_CString
          class has an array "[]" operator, which is what the temporary
          was being used for, i.e. individual element access.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp (connect):
        * tao/SHMIOP_Connector.cpp (connect):
        * tao/UIOP_Connector.cpp (connect):

          Verify that the remote Addr was initialized properly.  Failure
          can occur, for example, if hostname lookup failed when
          initializing the remote Addr.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp (connect):

          Don't bother using addr_to_string() to determine host and port
          to display in debugging output.  Simply use host() and port()
          instead.  Pluggable protocol neutrality isn't an issue here
          since this code is only used by the IIOP pluggable protocol.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp (decode):
        * tao/SHMIOP_Profile.cpp (decode):

          Delayed binding of hostname and port until first access.  This
          improves TAO's behavior in the presence of dynamically IP
          addresses, and also delays hostname lookups until the INET_Addr
          is actually needed, which may be never!

          Make sure the underlying INET_Addr is invalid, until it is first
          accessed by explicitly setting the family type to -1.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.i (object_addr):
        * tao/SHMIOP_Profile.i (object_addr):

          The object_addr_ is now initialized here, rather than at IOR
          decode time for several reasons:

                1. A request on the object may never be invoked.
                2. The DNS setup may have changed dynamically.
                ...etc..

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.h:
        * tao/SHMIOP_Profile.h:
        * tao/UIOP_Profile.h:

          Removed private declarations of the copy constructor and the
          assignment operator.  There is no need to have them in the
          derived class since the base class (TAO_Profile) already has
          private declarations of these methods.

        * tao/UIOP_Profile.cpp (decode):

          If the call fails (this should never happen), allow the profile
          to be created, and rely on TAO's connection handling to throw
          the appropriate exception.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/field_ci.cpp:
          Removed unused variable TAO_OutStream *os from some

          Move the common code into a library.  It is easier to maintain
          that way, in the sense that generating dependencies and other
          administrative tasks fall into well known (automatic)
          procedures.

        * tests/InterOp-Naming/Server_i.h:
        * tests/InterOp-Naming/INS_test_client.cpp:
          Removed the NameService features from the INS test.  First we
          test those features in many other places (implicitly), second a
          test should test only one thing, not 20, and third this
          eliminates all dependencies from orbsvcs in the tests directory,
          which is good because now we can automatically test a smaller
          subset of the ORB.

Mon May  8 09:42:47 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/run_test.pl:
          If the export_test crashed the script did not terminate the
          Trading Service process, which in turns hangs the build.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.cpp:
          A loop was accessing out-of-bounds data, causing a crash on the
          export_test.

        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile:
          Fixed the Makefile.  Apparently I inconsistently renamed some of
          the macros when fixing the process to create the dependencies.

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/server.dsp:

          In Release configurations, we were getting undefined symbols
          for inlined methods.  The cause was that the project files
          was set up to use Debug Multithreaded DLL instead of just
          Multithreaded DLL for the Release configurations.  Corrected
          and now links just fine.

Sat May  6 11:04:08 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: Removed the use of (BIN_TRUE).  Using "true"
          works just fine.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

        * tao/Any.cpp:
          The non-copying insertion operator for CORBA::Object was
          removing the Object_ptr pointer.  This is incorrect, in fact, I
          suspect that the function itself should go away.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init):

          Relaxed the restriction that ensured argv[0] be non-empty when
          argc was non-zero.  TAO no longer checks the length of argv[0]
          when argc is non-zero.  Instead it trusts the user's judgment.
          Thanks to Terry Rosenbaum <Terry.Rosenbaum@Radiology.MSU.edu>
          for pointing out that some users may wish to pass an empty
          program name argument (argv[0]) to CORBA::ORB_init().

          service context list is marshalled for DSI_Gateways in GIOP
          1.2. Previous version of GIOP was using a padding scheme which
          was not needed for GIOP 1.2. Thanks to Carlos for pointing this
          out.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_Core.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_export.h:

          Defined TAO_AV_SINGLETON_DECLARE in a different way to
          hopefully solve this problem on all compilers.  Since some
          do not want anything defined, we cannot use a no-argument
          version of the macro.  Now it takes in the singleton type,
          type class, and also the lock.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_Core.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_export.h:

          Needed to create a TAO_AV_SINGLETON_DECLARE macro and use
          it for TAO_AV_CORE since TAO_AV_SINGLETON_DECLARATION ()
          was having too many problems with the fact that it was being
          used with a template class with two template parameters.

Thu May  4 14:57:44 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makefile: Moved the settings of actually
          targets down after rules.tao.GNU.  Otherwise, these tests
          wouldn't get compiled even if minimum_corba is not used.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.h:

          Added in the warning(push)/(pop) stuff for MSVC.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AV_Core.h:

          I have quite a bit of AV stuff for NT in a separate workspace
          that has unfortunately gotten out of date (and some changes
          were not fully completed either).  One important one is the
          definition of the TAO_AV_CORE template which was busted on
          NT.  The problem was that two singletons existed, one in the
          DLL and one in the program itself.  I changed the template
          delcaration to use the special macros we have for this
          situation.  This means that the benchmarking test should now
          work.

          Thanks to Ferran Boladeres Salvad <salvadof@iis.fhg.de> for
          being the latest one to mention this.

        * */Makefile:
          It is now possible to generate all the IDL generated files using
          the <idl_stubs> target.
          For this to work the IDL files *must* be listed in the IDL_FILES
          macro, I changed all the Makefiles to do so.
          I also used IDL_SRC for the C.cpp and S.cpp files, this is just
          for consistency and ease of use, not mandatory.
          Updated all the dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp:
          Fixed nasty bug in the event channel gateways.  The local
          consumer proxy map was not recomputed correctly, because I was
          invoking Map_Manager::close() to reset the map.  This method
          resets the map, but it leaves it in an incosistent state,
          Map_Manager::open() does the right thing.  IMnsHO extremely
          counter intuitive.
          Thanks to Ron Klein <rklein@west.raytheon.com> for reporting the
          bug and providing a test for it.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Gateway.cpp:

          I started to test out my msvc_auto_compile.pl script and after
          testing it for the whole thing, found out that I soon ran out
          of disk space.  By the time I ran out of space, the PCH files
          made up 3 GB of disk.  So I removed them from these projects.

          Note that I did leave them in the projects that use MFC, since
          they do use them in a more beneficial way.

        * tests/MProfile/MProfile.dsw: (added)

          Add a workspace in this directory since there didn't seem to be
          one already.

          For performance reasons we don't want to use the default
          CORBA::Environment argument when accessing the values of some
          policies: doing so would require a new access to TSS storage on
          the critical path.  Yet, in some points a CORBA::Environment is
          not available.
          The first solution was to add a new accessor method, without an
          Environment, but that resulted in ambiguous calls when the code
          was changed to use local interfaces.
          The new solution is to have a get_foo(Foo&) method, this method
          does not need to be virtual (in fact it is inlined) and it is as
          efficient as the other call.

          Define macros to transparently remove the extra

          Updated the test to use the new macros.  Normally the
          applications will not use the macros, but our tests must compile
          and run correctly with a without native C++ exception support.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:
          For the generated GIOP request header response flag
          value for twoway requests, changed the hard-coded
          '131' value to the constant TAO_TWOWAY_RESPONSE_FLAG
          defined in corbafwd.h by Bala.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Accept_State.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Connectors.cpp: Removed support for reliable
          oneways from GIOP 1.1 implementation. This means that there are
          only two types of calls ie. oneway and two ways. All the
          policy settings for reliable oneways will not be considered at
          all. They will be mapped to a simple oneway.

        * docs/INS.html:
          Fixed link.

Fri Apr 28 20:56:43 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/ImplRepoC.h:
          Sun/CC 5.0 was not compiling because of a missing include, beats
          me why it needs it and all the other platforms don't.

Fri Apr 28 20:09:34 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * Modified Messaging.pidl, Pollable.pidl and TAO.pidl to use local
          interfaces, then re-generated the code using the local
          interfaces, made whatever modifications where required and
          stored the modifications as a patch file for future reference.
          The change is good because it is a step to resolve [BUGID:322],
          the memory management of local interfaces is well defined.
          And because the change reduces the code size, for example, on
          Linux the sizes before the change are:
                   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
                  39074   11832     264   51170    c7e2 .shobj/PollableC.o
                  17353    5812      60   23225    5ab9 .shobj/PollableS.o
                 109438   32556    2536  144530   23492 .shobj/MessagingC.o
                  53514   18712      88   72314   11a7a .shobj/MessagingS.o
                  27061    7516     584   35161    8959 .shobj/TAOC.o
                   6739    2048      32    8819    2273 .shobj/TAOS.o
          Once the files are generated using local interfaces the numbers
          change to:
                   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
                   8647    2684      64   11395    2c83 .shobj/PollableC.o

        * tao/Client_Priority_Policy.cpp:
        * tao/Messaging_Policy_i.h:
        * tao/Messaging_Policy_i.cpp:
          Reimplement the policies using the semantics for local
          interfaces. We inherit from the stub instead of the skeleton
          class, and there is no need to activate the object with the
          POA.  Interestingly destroy() becomes a no-op, when the last
          references goes away the object is destroyed without any other
          intervention.

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/Policy_Manager.cpp:
        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Changed to use the new local interfaces, no more references to
          the POA or activation.

        * tao/corbafwd.h:

Fri Apr 28 21:22:44 2000  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (create_ior_info):
        * tao/Invocation.h: Added support for GIOP 1.2 exceptions. GIOP
          1.2 raises two new exceptions for the Request and
          LocateRequest. Added support to handle these exceptions. To add
          support, I had to add a new method called create_ior_info ()
          which would create IOP::IOR information only once, if an
          exception is received from the server side seeking that
          information.

        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.cpp:
        * tao/Acceptor_Registry.h: Added a new method, get_acceptor (),
          that would return the right acceptor by taking a tag value. This
          is similar to the method in Connector_Registry.{h,cpp}.

        * tao/Pluggable_Messaging_Utils.h:
        * tao/operation_details.h:
        * tao/operation_details.i:
        * tao/target_specification.h:
        * tao/target_specification.i:
        * tao/GIOP_Utils.h:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Accept_State.cpp:

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Acceptors.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Connectors.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Connectors.h:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Headers.h:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Headers.i:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.cpp: Added support for GIOP 1.2

        * tao/GIOP_Server_Request.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Server_Request.h:
        * tao/GIOP_Server_Request.i: Removed some of the GIOP 1.2 specific
          data from here and moved it to a new file
          TaggedProfile.{h,cpp,i} which would do the related processing of
          the data to extract ObjectKey. As TAO servers, as on date do not
          use any data other than ObjectKey, we need to do the processing
          to extract ObjectKey from IOP::IOR and IOP::TaggedProfile.

        * tao/Pluggable.h: Added a virtual function, object_key (), that
          would extract an ObjectKey from an IOP::TaggedProfile.

        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.h:
        * tao/SHMIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
        * tao/SHMIOP_Acceptor.h:
        * tao/UIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
        * tao/UIOP_Acceptor.h: Concrete implementations for the above.

        * tao/Profile.cpp:
        * tao/Profile.h: Added a virtual function, create_tagged_profile
          (),that would create a IOP::TaggedProfile info from the profile
          info that is being stored. This is necessary as different
          protocol implementations could encapsulate different types of
          info in its profile which is a part of the server exhibited
          IOR.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Profile.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Profile.i:
        * tao/UIOP_Profile.cpp:
        * tao/UIOP_Profile.h:
        * tao/SHMIOP_Profile.cpp:
        * tao/SHMIOP_Profile.h: Concrete implementations for the above.

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.i: Added a method, addressing_mode (), to store and
          retrieve information about the GIOP 1.2 specific exception
          thrown. If we have received a LOC_NEEDS_ADDRESSING, we need to
          change the addressing mode and restart the request. This is
          something similar to LOCATION_FORWARD, but here we store only a
          flag to indicate what addressing mode to use so that subsequent
          invocations would use the right addressing mode.

        * tao/MProfile.h:
        * tao/MProfile.i: Added a method get_current_handle () that would
          allow acces for const objects.

        * tao/Tagged_Profile.cpp:
        * tao/Tagged_Profile.h:
        * tao/Tagged_Profile.i: New files that would do GIOP 1.2 specific
          data processing for the server side.

        * tao/Makefile: Added the above file in the Makefile.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Turned on support for GIOP 1.2. Now would be
          ideal time. Any bugs that arises can be fixed I am gone on vacation.

Fri Apr 28 19:57:41 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * Minor fixes to the IDL compiler to facilitate the automatic
          generation of code in the TAO library (i.e. the locality
          constrained interfaces).

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/arglist.cpp:
          Operations in locality constrained interfaces should have a
          default value for the CORBA::Environment argument.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception/exception_cs.cpp:
          Do not generate a _tao_any_destructor implementation for
          locality constrained types.
          The _tao_encode() and _tao_decode() methods should be trivial
          for locality constrained exceptions.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_ch.cpp:
          Use CORBA_Object in place of ACE_CORBA_1(Object), the former is
          more readable and easier to maintain.  Ditto cor CORBA_ValueBase
          and CORBA_ValueFactoryBase

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/cdr_op_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/smart_proxy_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/tie_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/tie_si.cpp:
          Use ACE_TRY_ENV for all the CORBA::Environment arguments.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/smart_proxy_ch.cpp:
          Fixed indentation in the generated code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:
          Removed spurious blank at the end of a line.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_is.cpp:

Fri Apr 28 13:16:58 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/InterceptorC.h: This file needs to be conditionally
          compiled.

Fri Apr 28 11:17:35 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/InterceptorC.cpp:
          Moved the line '#if (TAO_HAS_INTERCEPTORS == 1)' line to come
          after the line '#include tao/InterceptorC.h' to avoid link
          errors on NT.

Fri Apr 28 08:29:09 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Fixed unused argument warning.  The real fix is documented in
          [BUGID:550]

        * tests/Explicit_Event_Loop/server.cpp:
          The code was not using the exception macros.

Thu Apr 27 22:36:48 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAOC.h: Changed "orbconf.h" to "corbafwd.h".  Otherwise, it
          wouldn't compile for minimum CORBA.

        * tao/Interceptor.h:
        * tao/Interceptor.cpp:
        * tao/InterceptorC.cpp: Made sure we complete disable interceptors
          when TAO_HAS_INTERCEPTORS==0 (which is default for minimum
          CORBA.)

Thu Apr 27 18:06:53 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/ImplRepoC.h:
        * tao/ImplRepoC.cpp:
        * tao/ImplRepoS.h:
        * tao/ImplRepoS.cpp:
          tao/corba.h should not be included directly by files in the TAO
          library, it increases coupling and makes the (re)build times too
          long.

        * tao/POA.h:
        * tao/POA.cpp:
          POA.h did not need to include ImplRepoC.h

        * tao/Makefile:
        * examples/OBV/Typed_Events/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

Thu Apr 27 18:27:06 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp;
        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp:
          Removed varout.h from the project files.

Thu Apr 27 18:00:08 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype_fwd/interface_fwd_ch.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype_fwd/valuetype_fwd_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype_fwd/valuetype_fwd_ci.cpp:
          Renamed interface_fwd_c?.cpp to valuetype_fwd_c?.cpp and updated
          the macros name used in them.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_valuetype_fwd/valuetype_fwd_ci.h: Fixed
          incorrect macro names.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root/root.cpp (visit_valuetype_fwd):  Some
          cosmetic changes.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype_fwd.cpp: Fixed the erroneous
          include filenames.  Althought they don't actually get compiled
          for now.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_factory.cpp (make_visitor): Added but
          *disabled* the states for TAO_VALUETYPE_FWD_CH and
          TAO_VALUETYPE_FWD_CI so we can simply turn them on when they are
          ready.

        * examples/OBV/Typed_Events/Event_Types.idl: I accidentally
          checked in the forward declaration for the valuetype in this
          idl.  Unfortunately, forward_decl for valuetype is not
          implemented yet.

        * tao/Marshal.cpp:
          Removed the TAO_Marshal_Factory class it was not used because
          there is only one 'marshaling engine'.  In fact the marshaling
          engine has been reduced to a couple of virtual functions.

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Decouple the CDR classes from the append() and skip() operations
          required to implement Anys.  Someday we will be able to separate
          the Any implementation from the rest of the ORB.

        * tao/corba.h:
          Marshal.h does not need to get exposed to the users.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:
          Changed generation of a node's full name to
          generation of the local name in a few spots. At
          most places inside a function body, the local name
          is sufficient and also avoids compiler confusion
          when nested scoped names are repeated after skipping,
          for example foo::bar::foo.

Thu Apr 27 11:48:20 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

          engine that was removed sometime ago.  This is part of the work
          for [BUGID:135]

          sending each event.  This is better than sleeping after each
          event is sent, because the latter approach does not work if an
          exception is raised while pushing the event.

          The ACE_TRY_ENV argument is not used in the _unchecked_narrow
          operation, so there is no sense in generating it.  This removes
          a bunch of 'unused argument' warnings.

Tue Apr 25 19:25:28 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

          Added local interfaces support as defined in the CCM spec.
          Currently, all programming contructs (struct, union,
          sequence...) occurring within a local interface are treated
          correctly by the TAO_IDL compiler.  However, if these contructed
          types occurred outside of a local interface but contain other
          local types, then they don't get necessarily treated correctly
          at the moment and should get fixed in no time.  Support for
          semantic checking is also not complete (e.g., an operation of a
          regular interface can not take an argument of any local types.)

          Please see the "Portable Interceptor" test under
          $TAO_ROOT/tests/Interceptors for an example on how to implement
          local objects.  Also check out the releasenotes in local
          interface section which I will add very soon.

                  flag which directed idl compiler to generate locality
                  constraint interfaces.  This is now depreciated.

                * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp: The
                  idl compiler must generate
                  <_remote_interface_repository_id> for remote client
                  stubs now.

                * tao/Object.i:
                * tao/Object.cpp: Changed the method
                  <_interface_repository_id> as inlined, non-virtual
                  function and invoke either
                  <_remote_interface_repository_id> or
                  <_local_interface_repository_id> depending on whether
                  the interface is remote or local.  Added the two
                  aforementioned new virtual functions.

                * tao/LocalObject.h:
                * tao/LocalObject.cpp: Rename <_interface_repository_id>
                  to <_local_interface_repository_id>.

                * tao/LocalObject.h:
                * tao/LocalObject.cpp: Changed <_is_a> operation back to

                * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
                * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h: Forgot to initialize
                  other virtual base classes in be_local_interface and
                  be_abstract_interface.

                * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_interface.cpp (fwd_redefinition_helper):
                  Added redefinition check for local interface (forward
                  declaration must match with the actual definition.)

                * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_interface_header.h:
                * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_interface_header.cpp (check_further):
                  Added check for inproper inheritance of local interface.
                  A remote interface can not inherit from local
                  interfaces.  Also changed to compile the inheritance in
                  the derived class'es constructors.

                * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:
                * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp.diff: Added a new token IDL_LOCAL.

                * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
                * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp: Added rules for local and abstract
                  interfaces.  Currently, however, abstract interface is
                  still not supported.

                * TAO_IDL/include/ast_generator.h:
                * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_generator.cpp:
                * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_generator.h:
                * TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp: Modified the
                  {be_ast}_generate::create_{interface|interface_fwd} to
                  create different interface type based on the information
                  passed in from FE_InterfaceHeader.

                * TAO_IDL/include/fe_interface_header.h:
                * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_interface_header.cpp: Added new methods,
                  is_local and is_abstract to differentiate the type of
                  interface being parsed.

                * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_interface.cpp:
                * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_interface_fwd.cpp:
                * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

                * TAO_IDL/include/ast_interface.h:
                * TAO_IDL/include/ast_interface_fwd.h: Extended
                  {be|ast}_interface and ast_interface_fwd to represent
                  "local" and "abstract" interfaces other than regular
                  CORBA interface.  Two new methods, is_local_interface
                  and is_abstract_interface, are added to differentiate
                  the interface type.

                  I didn't create new visitor classes for either local or
                  abstract interfaces because they more or less generate
                  subset of regular interface and it's esier to simply
                  "turn off" some feature of regular interface depend on
                  the type of interfaces we are generating.

                * tao/Object.i:
                * tao/Object.cpp: Added implementation of
                  _tao_QueryInterface.  This method is used to downcast
                  local object.  Added a member data called <is_local_>
                  and a readonly accessor.  We use this method to find out
                  whether an object reference points to a local object or
                  not.  <_narrow> behaves differently for LocalObject and
                  Object.

                * tao/Object.h:
                * tao/Object.i: Changed _incr_refcnt and _decr_refcnt to
                  protected method.  Added two new virtual function
                  _add_ref and _remove_ref which call _incr_refcnt and
                  _decr_refcnt to manage the reference counting of
                  objects.  The CCM specifies these functions for
                  LocalObject.  So we need to change to use them in Object
                  also.

        * tao/IORManipulation.cpp:
        * tao/Object.cpp:

          Moved template instantations for auto_ptr<TAO_MProfile> to
          IORManipulation.cpp.  auto_ptr<TAO_MProfile> is only used by
          TAO_IOR_Manipulation.  One less potential contributor to
          footprint.

        * tao/Makefile:

          Removed copy constructor and assignment operator
          implementations, and declared them to be ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC
          and private.  TAO_Profile instances should not be copied.

          (object_key):

          Removed deprecated method that sets the underlying object key.

          (hash):

          Improved the hashing code to provide a more a unique hash by
          utilizing the ACE::hash_pjw() method, and the profile tag, in
          addition to values that were used before.  [Bug 543]

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp (set):
        * tao/SHMIOP_Profile.cpp (set):

          If hostname lookup fails, then fallback on the IP address.

        * tao/Object.cpp (_is_a, _key, _non_existent, _create_request,
          _request, _get_interface, _set_policy_overrides):

          Added error (errno) minor codes to some of the exceptions that
          potentially get thrown to improve information supplied by the
          exception.

        * tao/Connector_Registry.cpp (object_key_delimiter):

          Set errno to EINVAL if the supplied IOR pointer is null.

        * tests/Native_Exceptions/Makefile:
          The magic to disable the build when native exceptions where
          disabled was not working.  I changed it to use something similar
          to all the other makfiles and now it seems to work ok.

Tue Apr 25 12:08:49 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/examples/RtEC/MCast/MCast.cpp:
          Exception handling code for the mcast_eh.close() call was
          incorrect.
          The subscriptions of the multicast sender were incorrectly
          initialized.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          The constructor was not initializing the timeout_counter_
          field.
          Fixed the EGC_Mcast_EH::close() method, it was mistakenly
          reporting errors when it shouldn't.

        * orbsvcs/examples/RtEC/MCast/MCast.dsw:

          Made the appropriate changes based on the Wide Character support
          I did in ACE.  Mainly just renaming the ASYS_* macros to their
          ACE_* equivalents.

          Unicode support in TAO is pretty iffy right now anyway, so it is
          debatable if any of these macros will continue to be used in TAO.

Sat Apr 22 01:31:13 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Added a reminder for compiling idl files with
          -Gd flag if "direct" collocation strategy is to be used on those
          interfaces.  Thanks to Klemen Zagar <klemen.zagar@ijs.si> for
          uncovering the inadquency.

          Added the MSVC projects for this test.

        * tests/Explicit_Event_Loop/server.cpp:

          Fixed a warning on Kai, at the end there was return 0 that
          was unreached.  Altered the return statements so this should
          not occur anymore.

          The ORB id strings were not const-correct, but they are
          actually not needed for this test so I just use empty strings as
          ids.

          The ImR now pings a server right after starting it up.  It will
          not forward the client until after the server responds to a ping
          (or times out).  This prevents annoying race conditions where a
          server can notify the ImR but not be ready for requests yet.
          Thanks to Steve Totten <totten_s@ociweb.com> and Chanaka
          Liyanaarachchi <chanaka@ociweb.com> for providing examples and
          info on what was happening.

        * tests/MProfile/test_i.cpp:
          Removed an extra #include, the file included does not exist and
          it is not needed, clearly too much cut&paste programming.

Fri Apr 21 17:31:55 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/POA/Demux/demux_test_client.cpp:
          Fixed 'unreached statement' warnings.  When using ACE_RETHROW
          the return statement must go after the ACE_ENDTRY, actually
          implicit in an ACE_CHECK_RETURN macro.

Fri Apr 21 10:36:29 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp:
          Warnings for case-only differences in spellings (-Cw)
          were stopping code generation the same as an
          error would. Code generation now proceeds normally
          for warnings. Thanks to Moore Y. Cao <yilincao@lucent.com>
          for reporting this bug.

          classes store two copies of the connection handler pointers. One
          of them was held by the concrete implementation classes and
          other by the base class. So, removed the redundant copy in the
          implementation class.

          Remove all the old performance tests for other ORBS.
          The tests were not being actively maintained, nor where the ORBs
          that they tested for.
          If funding and time permits we could create tests for
          next-generation ORBs.

          clients and servers would now be able to recognise the 1.2
          message formats. I have not switched the GIOP format for TAO
          from 1.1 to 1.2, as some more work is pending.

          This directories were not in the daily builds, so they needed
          some updating to compile.

        * */Makefile:
          Many Makefiles were missing from the automatic builds.
          I updated as many as I could find.
          Some directories cannot compile in certain configurations, for
          example when minimum corba is present many tests and examples
          cannot work.  Before this change the higher level Makefile would
          not recurse to that directory, but that breaks encapsulation,
          and the priciple of least surprise: somebody may still try to
          compile in that directory and get spurious failures.
          I have changed the higher-level Makefiles to always recurse, and
          each Makefile decides if it is able to compile with the current
          configuration, using the BIN2 trick.

          DLL.

          to throw an exception if the operation lookup fails.
          Thanks to Carlos for suggesting this fix.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/exhaustive_test.pl:
          This script will invoke the Random test with several different
          configurations.  The test is rather slow, so it cannot be
          executed on the daily builds, but it really tests every feature
          of the event service.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/svc.conf:
          Use copy_on_write as the default strategy.

Tue Apr 18 09:42:47 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * docs/Options.html:
        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

          Removed descriptions of the deprecated "-ORBHost" and "-ORBPort"
          options, and updated the pluggable protocol release notes to
          reflect the changes.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Removed inclusion of "ace/INET_Addr.h."  It was only needed to
          support "-ORBHost" and "-ORBPort."  Those options have been
          removed, as detailed below.

          (init):

          Removed support for the deprecated "-ORBHost" and "-ORBPort"
          options.  These options were superseded by "-ORBEndpoint" long
          ago.

          Removed support for the old style "-ORBPreconnect" syntax
          (i.e. "-ORBPreconnect hostname:port").  It too was deprecated
          long ago.

        * tao/ORB_Core.h (TAO_ORB_Core):
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (set_iiop_endpoint):

          Removed this method since it was only needed to support the
          deprecated "-ORBHost" and "-ORBPort" options.

        * tao/Connector_Registry (make_mprofile):
        * tao/Exception.cpp (_info):

        * tao/UIOP_Profile.cpp (parse_string):
        * tao/corbafwd.h (TAO_NULL_POINTER_MINOR_CODE):

          Removed all uses of TAO_NULL_POINTER_MINOR_CODE.  It was
          misused as an exception location code.  An EINVAL error code
          should instead be set in the exception being thrown.

          This also frees up a location minor code.

        * tao/Makefile:

          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Proxy_RefCount_Guard.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Proxy_RefCount_Guard.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_RefCount_Guard.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_RefCount_Guard.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_RefCount_Guard.cpp:
          New implementations of the Guard idiom that deal with safely
          incrementing and decrementing the reference count on a proxy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Delayed_Changes.cpp:
          Cosmetic fixes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Proxy_Admin.cpp:
          The proxy should be deactivated *before* removing it from the
          collection.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Proxy_List.cpp:
          The reconnected() call was leaking resources when the object was
          not in the set.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Copy_On_Write.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Copy_On_Write.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ESF/ESF_Copy_On_Write.cpp:
          The Write_Guard was copying not only the contents of the
          original collection, but also the reference count value.
          There was a subtle race condition, the destructor has to wait
          until all the pending writes have completed before removing the
          object.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Use Guard idioms to safely remove reference count objects and
          destroy some entities when their reference count reaches 0.
          In some cases resources where leaked because the destructor was
          assuming that shutdown() or something similar was invoked.  In
          general this is correct, but in concurrent scenarios a thread
          may invoke shutdown() triggering the destruction of the object,
          while another thread is still making changes.  In such a case
          the destructor is responsible for the final cleanup operations,
          because the shutdown() method is not invoked again.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.cpp:
          Removed bogus inline.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Event.dsw:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Basic.dsw:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Random.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Random.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Random.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/Random.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic/run_test.pl:
          New test for the Event service.
          The test performs random operations on the event service, adding
          consumers, suppliers, then removing them, pushing events, etc.
          The operations are performed by multiple concurrent threads, in
          many cases in the context of an upcall to some consumer.
          This is the worst (or is it best?) torture test for the event
          channel.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          Add an optional argument to the ECG_UDP_EH::open() method,
          allowing the user to reuse the same socket address in multiple
          calls.  Thanks to Tom Ziomek <tomz@cc.comm.mot.com> for
          providing the patch for this feature.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.CosNotification:
          More missing libraries.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_Dispatching_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_Dispatching_Task.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_Dispatching_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPullConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPullSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPushConsumer.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
          Systematically use Guards to increment and decrement reference
          counts, and to destroy objects once their count reaches 0.
          Simplified the memory management of some objects by clearly
          delineating who is responsible for their destruction.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Concurrency/CC_command.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Concurrency/CC_command.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Concurrency/CC_naming_service.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Concurrency/CC_naming_service.cpp:
          Fixed several const-correctness problems.

        * InterfaceS.h:
        * InterfaceS.cpp:
          Removed from TAO, code moved to the IFR_Service
          directory.

        * Makefile:
        * TAO.dsp:
        * TAO_static.dsp:
        * POA_CORBA.h:
          'TAO_Export' removed from declaration of IRObject,
          since it is never instantiated inside TAO, and
          declared there only because it must be in the
          CORBA namespace.

Mon Apr 17 20:12:13 2000  Vishal  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 1.1.1 released.
