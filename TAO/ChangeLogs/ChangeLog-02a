        * tao/Makefile:
          Add IFR_Client_Adapter to the build, even under minimum CORBA.
          Without it the ACE_Dynamic_Service<TAO_IFR_Client_Adapter>
          template is undefined when we compile without inlining.

        * performance-tests/DII_Latency/Makefile:
        * performance-tests/DSI_Latency/Makefile:
        * performance-tests/Deferred_Latency/Makefile:
          Disable these directories when compiling with minimum CORBA.

        * performance-tests/DSI_Latency/client.cpp:
          Fix ACE_RCSID() macro

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf:
          Use the blocking flushing strategy for slightly better
          performance.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp

          Changed an overlooked TAO_Pluggable_Reply_Params to
          TAO_Pluggable_Reply_Params_Base.

Thu May 10 10:56:33 2001  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynamicInterface/TAO_DynamicInterface.dsp:

          Added link to TAO_Portableserver(d).lib. The link is
          necessary, but the project dependency in TAOACE.dsw was
          finding the path and doing the link under the hood.
          Thanks to Steve Hespelt <shespelt@bear.com> for
          pointing this out.

Thu May 10 08:46:21 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
          A debugging message was confusing it said 'connection from
          client', but it was used for both passive and actively
          established connections.  IMHO 'connection to peer' is less
          confusing.

          Several tests were too verbose for the nightly regression tests,
          eliminate a lot of output.

Thu May 10 07:11:16 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/DSI_Latency/Roundtrip.h: Added exception
          specification.

          Move each one of the tests in the Latency directory to its own
          place.  There are many advantages to this organization, for
          example, we can compile the basic tests even with minimum CORBA
          enabled.
          It is also easier to run the tests on the nightly regression
          builds, and somewhat easier to interpret the results.
          The disadvantage is that is is harder to maintain the code, if
          anybody has an idea on how to improve this they are welcome to
          change the code.

        * tests/DSI_Gateway/run_exception_test.pl:

          Changes to DynamicInterface classes to enable the
          storage/retrieval of a user exception when instantiation
          of these classe are used in a gateway. Also changes
          to the test code to use this new capability, and to
          remove the gateway's dependence on any IDL-generated
          files. README file updated, and files added to the
          MSVC project for completeness. The gateway test may
          now be run normally, as before, or with a new script
          that tests the passing of a user exception
          from the server, through the gateway and back to the
          client. This closes [BUGID:500].

          Extracted most of TAO_Pluggable_Reply_Params into a
          base class TAO_Pluggable_Reply_Params_Base, leaving
          out the InputCDR member. This base class is now used
          by TAO_ServerRequest, which does not need the cdr
          stream, eliminating the overhead of its construction.
          The client side request classes use the original
          class, now a subclass, that adds the InpurCDR member.
          This closes [BUGID:900].

Wed May  9 11:56:55 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

Tue May 08 21:26:19 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tests/AMI_Timeouts/client.cpp (main):
          Wait for all the threads to complete before destroying the ORB.

Tue May  8 13:28:36 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp (send_message_i):
          Correct buffer manipulation for messages queued after part of
          their data was sent, we cannot simply create a
          TAO_Asynch_Queued_Message and invoke bytes_transferred() because
          the message block chain is modified as part of the send()
          attempt.
          What we do now is a little different: the message block chain is
          modified as data is transferred, only the portion that has not
          been sent is put in the queue.  So, the fix is also a slight
          optimization.
          Improve the debugging messages for this code path.
          Fix the treatment of a return status of 0 from
          send_message_block_chain_i(), this indicates a partial send, not
          an EOF.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (send_message_block_chain_i):
          If the message was completely sent we should set the
          bytes_transferred argument correctly.

        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp (bytes_transferred):
          Update the message blocks that are completely sent, this is used
          by higher layers to detect what portion of the message block
          chain, if any, has to be queued.

        * tao/Object_Ref_Table.cpp (TAO_Object_Ref_Table):

          Reverted the change "Tue May  8 09:01:13 2001  Balachandran
          Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>".  The call to destroy() was
          correct since not all applications call ORB::shutdown() (or
          ORB::destroy()).  In such cases, memory leaks will occur since
          the object reference table destroy() method is not explicitly
          called.

          (destroy):

          The correct fix for the problem was to call unbind_all() on the
          underlying hash table in the destroy() method.  Doing so makes
          it safe to call the destroy() method more than once.

Tue May  8 10:02:47 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Reverted this change "Tue May  8 07:32:15 2001
          Balachandran Natarajan". The problem on Linux builds seems to be
          a manifestation from the problem that was fixed in this change
          "Tue May  8 09:01:13 2001  Balachandran Natarajan".

Tue May  8 09:01:13 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Ref_Table.cpp (~TAO_Object_Ref_Table): Removed a
          destroy () from the destructor. The destroy () has already been
          invoked during ORB_Core::shutdown (). The second call to destroy
          ()  really caused havoc in Win32 builds.

Tue May  8 08:17:13 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.h: Added a TAO_Export to TAO_ORB_Core_Auto_Ptr
          class.  Thanks to Johnny Willemson for reporting this.

Tue May  8 07:32:15 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Fixed a problem when the client connection
          handler is RW. The ORB_Core takes responsibility for closing the
          connections. It does so by getting the handles in an Unbounded
          Set. When the ORB_Core gets destroyed, the destructor of the
          Unbounded set is called. This creates problems as the allocators
          have already been removed. We now destroy the list by calling
          reset () before the ORB_Core gets destroyed.

        * tests/LongUpcalls/ami_server.cpp:
          Fixed RCSID

        * tests/LongUpcalls/run_test.pl:
          Fixed timeout, it was way too long

        * tests/AMI_Buffering/svc.conf:
        * tests/LongUpcalls/svc.conf:
          Made flushing strategy blocking, until bug 886 gets fixed this
          is the only workaround.

        * tests/BiDirectional_NestedUpcall/test_i.cpp:
        * tests/BiDirectional/test_i.cpp: Made some print statements less
          verbose.

Mon May  7 15:21:43 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Object_Ref_Table.h:
        * tao/Object_Ref_Table.cpp (destroy):

          Added a new destroy() method to explicity release the object
          references held in the object reference table.  This method will
          be called on ORB shutdown.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (shutdown):

          Explicitly destroy the object reference table since it contains
          references to objects, which themselves may contain reference to
          this ORB.  This fixes some problems with cyclic ORB lifetime
          dependency problems.

        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.i:
        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Bug 542 (http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=542)
          has reared its ugly head once again.
          However, I think I finally nailed it: the ORB_Core was reference
          counted by each object reference (via TAO_Stub), but the
          reference count was decremented in the TAO_Stub destructor
          *before* the TAO_Profiles were destroyed.
          This also fixes the crashes in Big_Oneways and Big_Twoways
          tests.

Mon May 07 10:47:11 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp (write_protocol_header):
          Optimize the implementation of this function.  Insted of
          marshaling each field of the GIOP header individually we create
          one big octet array, store all the fields there (they are octets
          for the most part) and then marshal the whole header in a single
          operation.  Saves a little over 0.5% on the client and server
          sides.

Mon May  7 11:37:43 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (fini): Deferred the deletion of the allocators
          till the  reactor registry is deleted. The RTCORBA has a
          configuration called Reactor-Per-Priority, which deletes the
          service handlers only when the registry is deleted. There seems
          to be a subtle problem in the way the handlers are de-registered
          from the reactor for this particular configuration. We will look
          at that problem next. This fix should get around that problem
          for the time being.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Component_Switching/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/Makefile:

          Added checks to make sure that the above examples do not compile

          changes from IIOP to these protocols.

Sun May  6 10:27:08 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.h:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.inl: Changed the error handling
          conditions. When we come across a read failure with EWOULDBLOCK
          we used to ask the reactor to call us back. This caused
          thrashing when the application received a signal. We dont ask
          the reactor to call us back, instead we just return a zero to
          the reactor. Further, changed the error codes to match the
          reactor semantics. This should fix bug id 830.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp: Made sure that we pass the error codes
          from the GIOP layer, as is to the reactor. We dont manipulate
          the return values as we did before. The return values just match
          the reactor semantics ie. returns -1 on error, 1 for a quick
          callback and a zero for everything is fine case.

        * tao/Wait_On_Read.cpp: The wait () call used to loop on
          reply_received flag alone. We now use a temporary variable also
          for the looping similar to the way other Wait strategies
          loop. The other strategies used a reactor and adhered to the
          reactor semantics. The Wait_On_Read did not use a reactor and
          followed a different semantics for success and failure. This
          created confusion at the protocol implementation level.

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Transport.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Transport.cpp: Replicated the changes from
          IIOP.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Component_Switching/distributer.cpp:

          Changed the order of connection to senders and receivers so that
          when switiching distributers the old distributer is disconnected
          from the sender before the new distributer is connected.

Sat May  5 20:31:36 2001  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Component_Switching/Makefile:

          Made changes to avoid compiling and running the test on VxWorks.

Sat May  5 16:24:11 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/TIE/server.cpp: Guarded some more portions using
          the ACE_HAS_USING_KEYWORD macros. This should prevent compile
          errors in the two Lynx builds.

Sat May  5 15:23:56 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Config_Scheduler.h: Added

          #define TAO_MIN_CRITICAL_PRIORITY 0
          #endif /* ! defined (TAO_MIN_CRITICAL_PRIORITY) */

          to fix a compile problem with TAO_USES_RMS_SCHEDULING is
          defined.  Thanks to Alexandre Cervieri

          Added code to clean up unregistered connection handlers at ORB
          shutdown.

        * tao/Wait_On_Read.cpp:

          Close the transport if we get a -1 from the call to
          read_process_message() on the transport.  This indicates an error,
          in which case we need to clean up the connection handler.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_10.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_12.cpp: Changed the call
          steal_data () to exchange_data_blocks (). This should give us a
          "release" free, malloc free and a lock free version of what we
          want to achieve.

Thu May  3 11:55:42 2001  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@cs.wustl.edu>

        These are a set of changes for enabling lock free CDR input
        stream allocators in TAO as default. (see my previous changes on
        Tue Apr 10 17:25:18 2001)

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          Modified the TAO_CodeGen::TAO_CDR_INPUT case to perform octet
          sequence optimization only if its safe. This check was absent
          previously, forcing us to always use locked input cdr allocators.

        * tao/IOPC.cpp:

          Regenerated the diff files. Note that i have added
          OctetSeqC.cpp.diff. This should be used to patch the IDL
          generated stub file instead of OctetSeq.diff.

Wed May  2 16:52:09 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.h: Added new methods that could dish out memory
          always from the global pool. The motivation for a new methods
          are:
          (1) In olden days out CDR's were created only in the invocation
              path and destroyed during the invocation path. If the ORB is
              configured with TSS, it made sense to get the allocators
              from the TSS. That doesn't hold true anymore as illustrated
              by point (2).

          (2) We now cache CDR streams, message blocks in classes within
              the connection handlers. These objects are on a
              per-connection basis as opposed to per-thread basis (though
              the thread may very well create the connections). We want
              the connections to be reused by other threads and so we
              cannot destroy the connections when the threads go
              away.

          The above two reasons motivated adding new methods that dish out
          memory from the global pool alone,  even if the ORB has been
          configured to use TSS.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp: Changes for bug id 871. We were
          trying to use a constructor for an InputCDR stream that made a
          copy from a message block. The process happened in two steps. It
          first allocated memory and then copied the contents. Both of
          them are bad. To make things efficient we use only the data
          block in which the incoming stream has been read to create a CDR
          stream. The same stream is passed onto the higher layers of the
          ORB. The stream *never* gets copied. The stream that is handled
          by the Reply_Dispatcher only uses this very same  data block to
          pass it onto the stubs. So this should give us a neat path with
          no-copies to the stubs. But there is one release that can be
          removed which will be done in the next cycle.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.h:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.inl: Added a new method
          steal_data_block (). This gives ownership away of the existing
          data_block and creates a new data_block for itself. Further the
          message_blocks use the memory from the global memory pool so
          that we dont have problems when the message blocks loose
          ownership to other threads.

Wed May  2 15:14:13 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h (TAO_InputCDR):
        * tao/CDR.i: Added a new constructor for TAO_InputCDR
          class. It is basically a wrapper for the new constructor added
          in ACE_InputCDR class by this ChangeLog entry "Wed May  2
          15:10:28 2001 Balachandran Natarajan ". This would make the
          construtor usable in TAO.

Wed May  2 11:26:10 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/TIE/Makefile:

          Disabled this build for SunCC 4.2. It worked before, even though
          4.2 does not have ACE_HAS_USING_KEYWORD defined (in other words,
          it has no namespace support), because the IDL compiler left out
          the #ifdef guards using the above macro if the interface was
          declared at global scope, and the only interface in the TIE
          example where the tie class was used happened to fall into that
          category. This generation of #ifdef guards was inconsistent,
          however, and now *all* tie classes are left out by the
          preprocessor if ACE_HAS_USING_KEYWORD is not defined.

Wed May 02 05:37:23 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tests/Queued_Message_Test/run_test.pl:
          Create a dummy run_test.pl to avoid problems on recalcitrant
          platforms.

Tue May 1 22:42:44 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_10.cpp (write_reply_header):

Tue May  1 22:14:01 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

          causes a TSS access.

          NOTE: We should never use default CORBA::Environment arguments
          (i.e. TAO_default_environment()) in methods that are used
          internally by TAO for specifically this reason.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp (generate_reply_header):

          Declare a new CORBA::Environment variable and wrap the
          write_reply_header() call within an ACE_TRY block.  That block
          was missing for some reason.  These changes are part of the
          fixes that remove a TSS access from the critical path on the
          server side.

Tue May  1 09:40:08 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/AMI_Buffering/Makefile: Made a check for ami instead of
          corba_messaging.

Mon Apr 30 22:50:27 2001  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ece.uci.edu>

        * tao/CORBALOC_Parser.h:
        * tao/CORBALOC_Parser.cpp:
          Fixed the blocker bug 849. Included some parsing code so as to
          check if the protocol used by the application is a known protocol.

Mon Apr 30 19:17:42 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/cdr_op_ci.cpp:

          If the member is an interface, the CDR extraction
          operator for the union extracts it straight into
          a _var. In the IDL_Test file full.idl, the interface
          member is undefined, and VxWorks balks. The target
          of the member extraction was modified to be
          foo_var.inout(), which it should have been anyway.

        * tests/IDL_Test/fwd.idl:
        * tests/IDL_Test/full.idl:

          If modules are nested, VxWorks gives a typedef error,
          thinking that mod1::mod2::foo_ptr and
          POA_mod1::mod2::foo_ptr are the same. Since the
          nested modules are not essential to the test, and
          rather than disable the test for VxWorks, one layer
          of modules was taken out of the mutually dependent
          IDL files.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root/root_sth.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_root/root_sth.h:

          New files for a new visitor that begins a separate
          pass through the AST for generating the tie
          classes. Code generation for the tie classes has
          been moved from *S.h to *S_T.h. Some compilers,
          notably SunCC 5.2, require that template class
          declarations and source be in the same
          'compilation unit', or corresponding .h and .cpp files.
          This new visitor handles code generation for the
          root scope and for modules. Tie class code generation
          for the other relevant data types (interfaces, attributes,
          and operations) is handled by existing visitors.

Mon Apr 30 16:53:27 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

          Updated the IDL compiler docs to include the handling of
          undefined forward declared interfaces, and the move of
          tie class declaration from the *S.h file to the *S_T.h file.
          This last was necessary to be compatible with SunCC 5.2
          builds where inlining is disabled.

Mon Apr 30 11:23:45 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Cache_Entries.h (relinquish_transport):
        * tao/Cache_Entries.inl (relinquish_transport):

          New method that causes the given TAO_Cache_IntId to relinquish
          ownership of the TAO_Transport associated with it.  This method
          exists to get around some inflexibility in the
          Transport_Cache_Manager interface.  It should be removed once
          the interface is improved.

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp (find_transport):

          Do not duplicate the TAO_Transport object after it is found.
          It is already duplicated during the find process.  Instead call
          the new TAO_Cache_IntId::relinquish_transport() method.  This
          change removes two locks from the critical path.  [Bug 878]

        * tao/IIOP_Endpoint.cpp (hash):

          Improved the speed of this hash operation by basing the hash on
          the IP address of the peer instead of computing a hash that
          involves some string operations (ACE::hash_pjw()).  Since this
          hash method is called on each invocation, i.e. in the critical
          path, a performance improvement should be noticeable.

        * tao/PortableServer/Servant_Base.cpp:

          Removed unused included header "Collocated_Object.h".

        * tao/CDR_Encaps_Codec.h:
        * tao/ClientRequestInfo.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/ServerRequestInfo.h:

          "Doxygenated" these headers.

Sun Apr 29 08:30:01 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile.bor (CPPDIR): Added a missing
          rule. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for pointing this out.

Sat Apr 28 10:40:01 2001  Michael Kircher  <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Acceptor.cpp:

          Fixed the failure behavior in the case the UDP socket
          returns an invalid handle. This had caused memory leaks,
          which are now gone.

Fri Apr 27 22:20:01 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile.bor: Added rules for the new idl file,
          full.idl.

Fri Apr 27 22:15:21 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Etherealization/Etherealization.cpp: Fixed a couple of
          compiler warnings.

Fri Apr 27 14:34:59 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Exception.cpp (_tao_get_omg_exception_description):

          Always return a valid string.  Previously zero was returned in
          the event of an error.  Return "*unknown description*" instead.

          Do not compile the minor code description tables if ACE_NDEBUG
          is defined.  This helps reduce the footprint for
          release/non-debug builds.

Fri Apr 27 14:11:11 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.i (location_forward_i):
        * tao/Invocation.cpp (invoke):

          Set the "restart_flag_" to 1 in the event of a location forward
          or a transport retry.  Previously, this was done in the
          generated stubs.  However, there was no reason to do it there.
          Setting it here saves on footprint.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/remote_proxy_impl_cs.cpp
          (gen_marshal_and_invoke):

          Fixed generated stub code so that attempts to demarshal return
          values or inout/out arguments will not occur if a
          LOCATION_FORWARD reply or a transport retry occurs.  In such
          cases, no inout/out and return values will be returned to the
          client so there is no point in attempting to demarshal them.
          [Bug 887]

          The receive_other() interception point in the generated code is
          now invoked in the event a target initiated LOCATION_FORWARD
          reply occurs or a transport retry occurs.

          No longer set the TAO_GIOP_Invocation::restart_flag_ variable in
          the generated stub.  The same thing can be done in the
          Invocation object itself.

          Check the ReplyStatus after invoking the receive_exception()
          interception point.  It may have transformed the caught
          exception in to a LOCATION_FORWARD, in which case the caught
          exception should not be rethrown.

Fri Apr 27 16:01:34 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/POA/Etherealization: Added new test to check for proper
          deactivation and etherealization of reference counted and non
          reference counted servants.  The following files were also
          modified:

          - tests/TAO_Tests.dsw
          - tests/POA/Makefile
          - tests/POA/Makefile.bor
          - tests/POA/README

Fri Apr 27 11:58:18 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Synch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp (dispatch_reply):
        * tao/Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp: Changed the steal_from () calls
          to steal_data () calls.  This removes the allocations along the
          critical path. The call steal_from () spent 48.5% of the time
          trying to do a reset_contents () (basically only memory
          allocations as per quantify) which should be gone now. We still
          see a problem when we transfer data_blocks. The transfer does a
          release which seems to occupy 35% of the time which would be
          almost impossible to do away with.

Fri Apr 27 11:45:58 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/POA/Single_Threaded_POA/run_test.pl:

          Updated this script to use the newer style perl modules, which
          support running on Chorus.

Fri Apr 27 11:31:38 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp: Added missing Endpoint_Selector_Factory.*.

Fri Apr 27 11:03:40 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DynAny_Test/driver.cpp:

          Clean up the orb in the Driver destructor.  This allows the test
          to run properly on VxWorks.

Fri Apr 27 10:45:35 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Explicit_Event_Loop/client.cpp:
        * tests/Explicit_Event_Loop/server.cpp:
        * tests/Explicit_Event_Loop/run_test.pl:

          Updated this test to use the newer style perl modules, which
          support running on Chorus.  This required a couple minor
          modifications to the client and server code.

Fri Apr 27 10:32:57 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile:

          Updated dependencies.

Fri Apr 27 07:29:28 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Client_Task.h: Included
          "tao/Messaging.h" in this file.

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Client_Task.cpp: Removed the inclusion
          of "tao/Messaging.h" from this file.

Fri Apr 27 04:07:00 2001  Michael Kircher <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Transport.cpp:

          Fixed the send method, as it used not the right handle to send
          its data.

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Acceptor.cpp:

          Fixed code to remove connection handlers.

Thu Apr 26 22:21:26 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/interface.idl:
        * tests/IDL_Test/generic_object.idl:

          Removed declarations that were put in to test handling
          of undefined forward declared interfaces, then commented
          out.

        * tests/IDL_Test/fwd.idl:
        * tests/IDL_Test/full.idl:

          New files, which test the generated code for undefined
          forward declared interfaces. Despite the names, the files
          contain interfaces that are mutually dependent. Each file
          has a fully defined interface that uses an interface which
          is fully defined only in the other file.

        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL_Test.dsp:
        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile:
        * tests/IDL_Test/Makefile.bor:

          Added the new IDL files.

Thu Apr 26 20:18:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_12.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_10.cpp: Used the new method
          ACE_InputCDR::steal_data () to extract data from the
          stream. This should help a bit with the performance and would
          also address part of bug # 875 in bugzilla. More changes for bug
          875 and 871 would be following this one.

Thu Apr 26 15:01:55 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Single_Read/Makefile: Fixed a typo. Thanks to Chad for
          poiting this out.

Thu Apr 26 09:34:56 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MessagingC.cpp:
        * tao/diffs/MessagingC.cpp.diff:

          Added missing

          #if (TAO_HAS_AMI_CALLBACK == 1) || (TAO_HAS_AMI_POLLER == 1)

          guard around the CDR operator implementations for class
          Messaging::ReplyHandler and regenerated the .diff file.

Thu Apr 26 08:14:20 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Client_Task.cpp:
        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/client.cpp: Added a missing include
          "tao/Messaging.h" so that the file would compile when
          interceptors are turned off. This is part of the requirement for
          writing TAO applications, which should include all the namespace
          files implicitly or explicitly.

Thu Apr 26 08:06:30 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Single_Read/Makefile: Made sure that the test builds even
          when Messaging is turned off. As a matter of fact the test does
          not depend on Messaging at all.

Thu Apr 26 07:26:19 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Transport.cpp: Fixed a compile
          error.

Wed Apr 25 16:15:49 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/CORBANAME_Parser.cpp:
        * tao/DLL_ORB.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
          More ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION statements printed even when
          TAO_debug_level is 0.

Wed Apr 25 18:04:35 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp: Removed the superflous
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG statement.

Wed Apr 25 15:55:47 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Makefile:
          Disabled the build if CORBA Messaging is not enabled.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
          Fixed warning about unused variable.

Wed Apr 25 17:39:46 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServerC.h:
        * tao/diffs/PortableServerC.h.diff:

          Replace an overlooked ACE_TRY_ENV with
          TAO_ENV_ARG_DECL_WITH_DEFAULTS, and updated the
          .diff file. Thanks to Bala for pointing this out.

Wed Apr 25 16:09:25 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connection_Handler.h:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.inl:
        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp: Removed the is_registered_
          flag. This flag was used when the ORB was caching the connection
          handlers. This flag was used to indicate whether the connections
          handlers have been registered with the reactor or not. This flag
          is not necessary now as this work is done by a flag in the
          wait_strategy.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp
        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.cpp: Removed references to the is_registered flag
          in the Connection_Handler. Changed them to use the
          Wait_Strategy::is_registered flag instead.

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Transport.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/ami_interface_ch.cpp:

          Removed a check for code generation already done. This
          visitor generates code in a special pass specific to
          AMI, and can never happen more than once. If an
          interface is forward declared, the 'completed' flag
          can be set in its full definition node, which was
          conflicting with the check in this visitor.

        * tao/ORB.h:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:

        Added a new, non-standard, work_pending() where you can specify a
        timeout.  This essentially works as a idle timeout.  See DOC bug
        868 for details on the motivation.  There is currently no test for
        this--I wanted to get this in before the next beta so people could
        try it out if they want.  It compiles, and, since there are no
        dependencies on it, it should be okay.

        Thanks to Steve Totten, Paul Calabrese, Phil Mesnier, Irfan
        Pyarali, and Doug Schmidt for helping work out the details of the
        use case and possible solutions.  [Bug 868]

Wed Apr 25 03:34:15 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_close): No
          longer need to hint for cleanup as we use reference counter to
          determine when to cleanup the backing store now.  This should
          fix the RTCORBA tests crashing as those tests also use the
          connection handler on the client side and the backing stores
          were being cleaned up in the wrong order.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
          Enable message dumping only at debug level 5, same as the output
          data path.
          Dump the messages *before* updating wr_ptr(), otherwise the dump
          makes no sense.
          Removed Bala's hack made on Mon Feb 19 12:11:23 2001, this was
          supposed to support SHMIOP, but with the changes on the sending
          side it actually break things.
          After this change the IDL_Cubit regression test works, but there
          are some scenarios that may not, more detailed documentation in

          Removed unnecessary 'extern' from the declaration of the
          global hooks for defined interfaces, and uninlined the
          implementation of those hooks. Egcs, for one, can't
          handle an inline function that isn't declared in the
          same file. The other compilers probably disable inlining
          in such a case anyway.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_decl.h:

          Changes to IDL compiler, enabling it to handle a forward
          declared interface that is not defined in the same
          file (but must be fully defined somewhere in the build).
          Specific changes include:
          - Inlining disabled for CDR operators for all interfaces.
          - Any operators declared for undefined interfaces.
          - Inlining disabled for all interface _var and _out classes.
          - For undefined interfaces, extern declarations added for
            global functions that access the methods _duplicate,
            _nil, _narrow, and CORBA::release for the defined interface.
            Also added one to replace the upcast() mathod in the
            template object sequence classes in TAO, so an undefined
            interface pointer can be cast to CORBA::Object*.
          - For defined interfaces, added the implementation of the
            global methods (using the interface's flat name).
          - Added static hooks for these methods to the interface _var
            class (used by the template object sequence classes in TAO).
          - Modified generated code for non-template object sequence
            base classes, to use the global hooks for undefined
            interfaces.
          - Modified generated code for unions containing interfaces,
            so that the TAO_OBject_Manager template class will use the
            global hooks if the interface is undefined.
          - Modified generated code for an operation to use the
            global hooks, if it has an undefined interface in its
            signature.

          Regerated all the IFR skeleton files. A different way of
          handling the CORBA namespace in the generation
          of the corresponding stub files gave the proxy classes,
          proxy factory function pointers, and tie classes slightly
          different names.

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/IRObject_i.h:

          A change in the include structure of the generated stub and

          namespace, and makes various other minor mods to make

        * tao/Object.h:
        * tao/Object.i:

          Added the static methods to CORBA::Object_var, similar to
          the static methods added to generated interface _var
          classes. These, however, don't need to call global hooks
          because CORBA::Object is always 'defined'. They need to
          to be here for use in the template object sequence classes
          in TAO, where there is no knowledge of whether the template
          parameter is a defined interface or not when the template
          class is compiled.

        * tao/Sequence_T.cpp:
        * tao/Sequence_T.i:

          Modified TAO_Unbounded_Object_Sequence<T,T_var>,
          TAO_Bounded_Object_Sequence<T,T_var>, and
          TAO_Object_Manager<T,T_var> to call the new static
          T_var methods instead of T::_duplicate, T::_nil, T::_narrow,
          and CORBA::release (T_ptr), since the interface template
          parameter may be undefined when the template class is compiled.
          Also redefined the sequence template upcast() method in the
          same way, since it calls for a cast of the (possibly
          undefined) interface pointer to CORBA::Object*.

        * tao/corbafwd.h:

          Removed an overlooked typedef that was a temporary hack
          while working on CORBA 2.4 compliance for the IFR.

          The schedule_output() and cancel_output() methods are invoked

          again.
          The methods are renamed schedule_output_i() and
          cancel_output_i() and they are made private, because only the
          Reactive_Flushing_Strategy should invoke them.

          the queue mutex.  Since we need to lock the queue just before we
          do any I/O it is a very natural fit, and saves us one mutex
          per-call.

        * tao/Transport_Timer.cpp:
          Add support for timeout notifications from the Reactor.  This is
          used to implement the TIMEOUT buffering constraints when the
          application does not send events continously.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Factor out common code in drain_queue_i() into
          drain_queue_helper().
          Factor out code in send_message_queue(), incidentally
          send_message_queue() did not grab the queue lock, fixed that
          oversight.
          Made TAO_Block_Flushing_Strategy a friend class to access a
          couple of _i() methods.

        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp:
          Sometimes the message block chain contain trailing empty
          elements.  Those elements must be skipped, otherwise the
          current_block_ field never becomes 0, even though there is no
          more data to send.

        * tao/Block_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          In the blocking flush strategy we need to drain the queue as
          soon as schedule_output() is called, otherwise it is possible
          that the queue will never be drained.

        * tests/Queued_Message_Test/Queued_Message_Test.cpp:
          Use the TAO_Async_Queued_Message class for the test, the base
          class is abstract now.

        * tests/Oneway_Buffering/client.cpp:
          Initialize payload with non-zero bytes for easier debugging

        * tests/LongWrites/Makefile:

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Makefile:
          Update dependencies

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/client.cpp:
          Made request payload smaller, it was taking too long to run
          otherwise.

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Client_Task.cpp:
          Made the test less verbose

        * tests/Makefile:
          Add a couple of missing tests Big_Twoways and Big_Request_Muxing

        * performance-tests/Latency/client.conf:
          Made output path blocking, using reactive out with blocking
          input does not quite work.

        * examples/Buffered_AMI/test.idl:
        * tests/Reliable_Oneways/Test.idl:
        * tests/Blocking_Sync_None/Test.idl:

        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Transport.cpp:
          Add missing function (removed during the merge).

        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.cpp:
        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.h:
          The bytes_transferred() method does not need to return anything,
          the return value was ignored anyway, so change it to return
          void.

        * tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp:
          Fixed implementation of bytes_transferred(), the byte_count
          argument was not updated on all exit branches.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
          Fixed inconsistency with main trunk.

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp:
          Set the must_flush and set_timer flags to zero if there is no
          buffering constraint policy.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Cosmetic fixes.  Return 1 from drain_queue_i() even if the flush
          operation returned 0, the return value is supposed to represent
          what happened to the message, not if there was a generic problem
          with the ORB.

        Tue Apr 17 09:59:38 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.h:
        * tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp:
          Add an argument in buffering_constraints_reached(), this new
          argument represents the current deadline for the transport.
          The current deadline is used to determine if the timer needs to
          be reset or if the timer has already expired.
          Unless the flushing strategy is turned on we need to check the
          timers on all exit paths.

          Change TAO_Transport_Sync_Strategy to *always* flush and always
          schedule output on every request.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Use the new interface in the sync strategies to activate the
          output as soon as the timer expires.  Keep track of the current
          deadline for scheduling output.
          Fixed boundary condition in drain_queue_i(), there is a while()
          loop to fill iovecs with the contents of the queue, it is
          possible to exit the loop without anything in the iovec.  In
          this case we don't want to attempt a send() call.
          Remove unused argument from the send_synchronous_message_i()
          method.

        Sat Apr 14 17:04:21 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp (send_synchronous_message_i):
          The message was left in the queue even if a problem was detected
          in the write() operation.

        Sat Apr 14 17:01:05 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
          Complete merge for Win32, CVS' automatic merge was not quite the
          right thing for this file.

        * tao/BiDir_Policy_i.cpp:
          This file was removed in the main trunk but was accidentally
          resurrected during the merge.

          for twoways blocked during writes.

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          Add method to insert message at the head of the queue.

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.h:
        * tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp:
          Use two separate flags to return if:
          (1) the queue should be immediately flushed
          (2) and/or the ORB should start draining the queue

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Use the new interface in TAO_Sync_Strategy to correctly
          implement TAO::BUFFER_MESSAGE_COUNT and the TAO::BUFFER_SIZE
          buffering constraint policies.

        Wed Apr 11 10:21:35 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * With the following changes the semantics of oneways are
          bug-compatible with the main trunk.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Add new method to check if the transport queue has any data
          pending.

        * tao/Flushing_Strategy.h:
          Add new operation to block until the queue becomes completely
          empty.

        * tao/Block_Flushing_Strategy.h:
        * tao/Block_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.h:
        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          Implement flush_transport() in each concrete strategy.

        * tao/Transport.h:
          Remove old code that was commented out anyway.

        Mon Apr 09 00:41:20 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
          The default scope should be SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT, but was
          overriden and became SYNC_NONE.

        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          Fixed conditions to terminate the loop.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Initialize byte_count to zero before calling send(), add more
          ACE_ASSERT() calls to debug the system.

        Sat Apr  7 21:13:48 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Separate the path for synchronous and asynchronous requests more
          cleanly.
          Merge the close_connection() changes from the main trunk, the
          ORB was dead-locking on me.
          Improve output for sent iovectors, now it is only generated if
          TAO_debug_level==2 and the Log_Msg is locked to prevent other
          threads from dumping the same messages.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (drain_queue_i):
          New method used by the synchronous path to send data ASAP.

        * tao/Invocation.h:
        * tao/Invocation.cpp (invoke):
          Clarify the semantics of the <twoway_flag> argument, actually it
          means that the ORB should wait until the data is delivered to
          the wire.
          Oneway invocations with the SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT policy should
          block until the data is delivered to the wire.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
          Only print the full contents of the received data when the debug
          level is *exactly* 2.

        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.cpp:
          Fill up the messages with a repeating pattern, this is useful
          during debugging.

        Thu Apr 05 10:36:57 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
          Remove the declaration of the done() method, the semantics were
          not clear and it was removed a couple of iterations ago.

        * tao/Block_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          Wait until all_data_sent() returns.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Cleanup handle_output() no need to loop, the drain_queue()
          method does that.
          After trying to send a message and blocking the send_message_i()
          method was not updating the new Asynch_Queued_Message with the
          number of bytes sent.
          drain_queue() loop was too complicated for its own sake.

        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.h:
        * tests/Big_Oneways/Test.idl:
        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.cpp:
          Add methods to prime the connections among multiple clients.

        * tests/Big_Oneways/server.cpp:
          Increase timeout for initial session registration.  Important
          for manual executions.

        Wed Apr  4 10:53:27 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Remove dead code.
          Rename some methods to more clearly reflect their intent.
          Simplify the management for the outgoing data queue.  The
          cleanup_queue() method removes any element that is completely
          sent, while the drain_queue() method simply tries to send as
          much data as possible.

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.inl:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          Each derived class can decided if the message has been
          completely sent very efficiently, no need to keep a local
          variable for that.
          We do need variables to keep track of closed connections, failed
          sends and timeouts.

        * tao/Messaging_Policy_i.cpp:
        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
          Improved debugging messages for timeouts

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.inl:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          Specialize the Queue_Message class for Synchronous and
          Asynchronous messages.  Their behavior is completely different:
          synchronous messages (twoways and reliable oneways) are
          allocated from the stack, they should not copy the CDR stream
          and thus have to deal with message block chains.
          Asynchronous messages (oneways and AMIs with SYNC_NONE policy)
          are allocated from the heap, they must copy their data and thus
          can reassemble it in a single buffer.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Changed the transport to use the new interface in the
          Queued_Message class.
          Completely separate the synchronous and asynchronous operation
          path.
          The new implementation recovers some functionality lost in
          previous revisions: multiple messages can be sent in a single
          iovector.

        * tests/Big_Oneways/Test.idl:
        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.h:
        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.cpp:
          Add ping() operation to the Session IDL interface.
          This is used to validate the session during startup, i.e. ensure
          that enough connections are available for all the threads.

        Sat Mar 31 14:56:37 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Fixed memory management and synchronization problems.
          Invoke the connection_closed() method on all the pending
          messages if the connection is closed.

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.inl:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          If the connection is closed there is no sense in trying to
          continue sending the message.
          The done() method returns 1 if the connection was closed or if
          the message was completely sent.

        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          Propagate any errors from Transport::schedule_output() and
          Transport::cancel_output()

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/Big_Request_Muxing.dsw:

          Another regression test, similar to Big_Oneways, but this one
          uses a long request *and* a long reply.

        * tests/LongWrites/Sender.cpp:
          Fixed warning about unused variable

        * tests/LongWrites/Makefile:
          Fixed Makefile

        * tests/Timeout/client.cpp:
          Verify that at least some of the messages timeout and others
          complete the test successfully.

          Do not close the connection if it sends 0 bytes.  This is
          perfectly possible when using non-blocking I/O.

        Wed Mar 28 10:42:12 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * Another merge for the branch fixing bug 132

        Tue Mar 20 09:34:53 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Improved error checking for Queued_Message allocations.

        Sat Mar 17 17:52:27 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Removed the current_message_ field, using the head of the queue
          works just as well, at least as long as we always push events to
          the end of the queue.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          Use the Flushing Strategy to schedule output and cancel output

        Sat Mar 17 15:34:14 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.h:
        * tests/Big_Oneways/Session.cpp:
          Fixed signed/unsigned warnings

        * tests/Big_Oneways/Coordinator.cpp:
          Print error messages in all exception cases

        * tests/Big_Oneways/run_test.pl:

        Fri Mar 16 15:49:26 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:

        * tests/Big_Oneways/client.dsp:

          Changed the test to work more predictably on multi-CPU boxes.
          The sessions are configured at creation time, and they don't
          start sending events until start() is called.
          Instead of automatically destroy them on shutdown we wait until
          they all stop and then explicitly use a destroy() method to take
          them down.

        * tests/Big_Oneways/server.cpp:
          Add new stress test for the non-blocking I/O features in the
          ORB.  This test is more focussed than LongWrites, and its
          shutdown sequence is better designed (LongWrites tends to crash
          after running successfully.)

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
          Had to manually merge Bala's changes from Sat Feb 17 23:08:44
          2001.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
          Cosmetic fixes.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
          Print debugging messages when output is scheduled, and alse when
          it is canceled.
          Do not register the handler more than once on the reactor.

        * tao/Queued_Message.inl:
          The done() condition was reversed.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Add a ton of debugging mesages, including detailed messages of
          outgoing and incoming data, information about each queued
          message, etc.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (send_message_block_chain):
          Always add the number of bytes transferred on each send() call,
          even when it returns an error.

        * tao/Transport.cpp (send_message_i):
          Use easier to read code when deciding what messages are queued.
          Before calling schedule_output() and returning we must queue the
          message, forgot to do that in the previous version.

        * tests/LongWrites/client.cpp:
          I'm tweaking the test trying to make the termination condition
          more reliable.  Unfortunately after one of the clients finishes
          the rest does not receive all the required messages.
          I will probably have to change the protocol, which is probably a
          good idea anyway, so we can control the number of threads too.

        * tests/LongWrites/run_test.pl:
          In the haste to merge the fix_bug132 bug I forgot to incorporate
          the support for the multiple test types.

        * tao/Queued_Message.inl:
          Both done() and mb() were using contents_, but the flow has
          changed to use current_message_.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Simplify code flow in send_current_message()
          Simplify code in dequeue_head()

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp:

        Tue Mar  6 19:44:44 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:
          When printing an invalid GIOP magic number use hex values, not
          the character representation, because the latter can print out
          garbage.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Print the return value of each handle_events() call, on an
          attempt to figure out why it is spinning.

        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Print handle, return value and errno after each call to
          send_current_message()

        * tao/Wait_On_Leader_Follower.cpp:
          Don't enter the event loop if the reply has been received

        * Merged in changes from the fix_bug132 branch.  I need several
          bug fixes from the main trunk.  In my experience the easiest way
          to do this is to create a new branch higher up in the main
          trunk, close the old branch and propagate its changes to the new
          one.
          In this case we created fix_bug132_iter02 (today) merge the
          changes from fix_bug132 into that branch, and close fix_bug132.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Continue implementation of reactive output.
          On this pass I fixed the code to deal with several error
          conditions, invoke schedule_output() if the connection returns
          an EWOULDBLOCK, also cancel the output if there is no data to
          send.
          Fix syncronization on send_queued_message()
          Fix memory allocation for message blocks contained in
          Queued_Message, they cannot be cloned() because that would
          allocate from TSS.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
          Implement schedule_output() and cancel_output() methods.

        * tao/Wait_On_Leader_Follower.cpp:
          Do not re-insert the transport into the reactor on each wait,
          once is enough.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
          Implement a handle_output() callback, delegate on the
          TAO_Transport

        * tao/IIOP_Endpoint.cpp:

          Try to count the number of incoming messages and only exit when
          all have been received.

        * tests/Queued_Message_Test/Queued_Message_Test.dsp:
          Removed a number of unused files from this unit test.

        Sun Feb 25 10:22:59 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Instead of releasing the message blocks as soon as possible we
          delay until the queued message is deallocated.  This will make
          it possible to release all the data in the same thread that
          allocated it, preserving the support for TSS allocators.

          with big responses.

        Wed Feb 14 18:38:11 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          Fixed queue manipulation logic

        * tests/Queued_Message_Test/Queued_Message_Test.cpp:
          The test was miscounting remove operations from the queue.

        * tests/Queued_Message_Test/Queued_Message_Test.dsw:
        * tests/Queued_Message_Test/Queued_Message_Test.dsp:
          Add MSVC project files.

          Add flag to control message block ownership, used to minimize
          memory allocations.

          Use the ownership flags for the Queued_Message.

        * tests/Makefile:

          parameters.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.cpp:
          Use the send() method with iovec arguments.

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.h:
        * tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          More cleanup for the Sync_Strategies, the must_queue() method
          does not require a Stub argument.

        Mon Feb 12 10:15:47 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Add new method to send a message block chain.
          The template method to send data takes an iovec argument.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
          Implement the iovec-based send() template method.

        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          The cleanup code was broken.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
          Use the message block chain method to send short critical
          messages.

        Fri Feb 09 10:50:47 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Queued_Message.h:
        * tao/Queued_Message.inl:
        * tao/Queued_Message.cpp:
          Add new class to represent a queued message in the outgoing
          path.  This class has to keep more than just the message block,
          it also takes care of timeouts and signaling any waiting thread
          when the message is sent.

        * tao/Message_Sent_Callback.h:
        * tao/Message_Sent_Callback.inl:
        * tao/Message_Sent_Callback.cpp:
          Define interface to signal threads waiting for a message to be
          sent out, e.g. twoway requests blocked waiting for a queued
          message.

        * tao/Flushing_Strategy.h:

        * tao/Block_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.h
        * tao/Reactive_Flushing_Strategy.cpp:
          New classes to control how the outgoing data is flushed,
          either by blocking on write() or by using the reactor.

        * tao/Resource_Factory.h:
        * tao/default_resource.h:
        * tao/default_resource.cpp:
          Add new methods to create the flushing strategy.

        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.i:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Add accessor for the flushing strategy.  Notice that the
          strategy is stateless so a single instance (per-ORB) is needed.

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.h:
        * tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp:
          The Sync_Strategies have been simplified.  They are now
          stateless, and they only need to answer a couple of questions
          (1) should a message be buffered, (2) should the ORB flush a
          queue.

        * performance-tests/Latency/st_client.cpp:
          Destroy the ORB on shutdown.

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp:
          Add the new files to the TAO project files.

        * tao/Transport.h:
        * tao/Transport.inl:
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
          Move much of the functionality of sending and outgoing message
          queue up to the base transport class.  Remove a lot of code
          deailing with the previous (blocking) queues.

          Change the transport and connection handlers to use the new
          outgoing message queue, the flushing strategy and the changes to
          the SyncStrategy.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          Added a sanity check for the length of sequences not to exceed
          the length of the stream - cf. bug 58.

        * tests/MT_Timeout/client.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Timeout/Client_Task.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Timeout/Client_Taks.h:

          Made the test more smart and tolerant regarding scheduling jitters.
          The test now checks how many calls have taken too long to return
          and prints warnings, or even errors in the case more than 5 % of
          the calls have taken too long. Thanks to Carlos for his suggestions.

Mon Apr 23 00:45:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/*/Makefile
          All AVStreams tests now depend on libACE_QoS.so (even if they
          do not use QoS), because libTAO_AV.so links against libACE_QoS.so
          if QoS was enabled.
          libACE_QoS.so should only be conditionally linked in.
          (Check if rapi=1)

Sun Apr 22 19:59:06 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Transport.cpp:

        * tests/Oneway_Buffering/README:
          Too much cut & paste in the documentation.

Sun Apr 22 16:44:12 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Pluggable_Messaging_Utils.cpp:
          Use default constructor for the IOP::ServiceContextList instead
          of the constructor taking the maximum size hint.  This solves
          [BUGID:876]

Sun Apr 22 16:27:20 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Server_Request.i (operation):

          This method is now basically a wrapper around the
          ACE_CString::set() method.  This change makes it easier to
          control whether or not the TAO_ServerRequest object should copy
          the operation name string. [Bug 870]

        * tao/TAO_Server_Request.cpp (TAO_ServerRequest):

          This constructor now accepts a "const char *" instead of an
          ACE_CString.  There is no longer any need to use an ACE_CString.

          (_tao_send_reply_exception):

          Initialize the static buffer using aggregate initialization
          instead of memset().  It's cleaner.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_10.cpp (parse_request_header):
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_12.cpp (parse_request_header):
        * tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.cpp (parse_request_header):

          Don't bother creating a temporary ACE_CString.  Just pass the
          operation name string to The TAO_ServerRequest object.
          TAO_ServerRequest now does the "Right Thing"tm in terms of
          managing the operation name string.  This removes one heap
          allocation from the criticial path (i.e. zero allocations in the
          common case (no character set translator) and one allocation in
          the case where a character set translator is used). [Bug 870]

        * tao/LocalObject.cpp:

          Removed inclusion of "ace/Auto_Ptr.h."  There was no need to
          include it.

          (_hash):

          Implemented this method.  Simply base the hash on the address of
          the object.

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tao/*/Makefile:

          Updated dependencies.

          includes.  Thanks to Carlos for reporting this.

        * examples/PluggableUDP/tests/Basic/run_test.pl:

          Extended the time to wait for the test.

          Remove the reference count, this allow us to eliminate the
          creation (and destruction) of 3 locks on the server's critical
          path.  This fixes [BUGID:873]

          Fixed typecode generation for structs and exceptions
          that have an enum defined inside. The enum member names
          were inserted into the typecode and added to the member
          count. Thanks to Tom Lake <Tom.Lake@glossa.co.uk> for

          Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>". Going over the fix from
          scratch as the fix is wrong.

Wed Apr 18 10:56:30 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/BiDirectional_NestedUpcall/run_test.pl: Fixed the
          run_test.pl script. Thanks to Carlos for pointing out that this
          script does not work.

Wed Apr 18 10:28:16 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp: Added an extra check for errno ==
          EAGAIN. After a read, if the errno is set to EAGAIN, a value of
          0 was returned to the reactor. This was because errno values of
          EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK are same. This made the reactor call the
          handle_input () again and again. Every call would return a 0
          with errno set to EAGAIN. Thanks to Jody Hagins
          <jody@atdesk.com> for coming up with a test case that
          demonstrated the problem. Need to check the test case in with
          some modifications.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp: Made some cosmetic fixes.

Wed Apr 18 10:28:53 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_be_visitor_union/union_cs.cpp:

          Added check for self-assignment in code generation for
          assignment operator. The lack of the check caused not
          only inefficiency, but also a crash if the union's
          active member is a pointer type, since the code
          deallocates the old member first. Thanks to
          Uwe Jger <jaeger@varial.de> for pointing out the missing
          check.

Wed Apr 18 09:44:15 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Leader_Follower.h: Added TAO_Export macros. Looks to me that

Tue Apr 17 21:21:06 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Collocation/Coll_Tester.cpp:
        * tests/Collocation/Coll_Tester.h: Added shutdown method to
          destroy the RootPOA and the ORB.  The lack of it was causing the
          test to crash.

        * tests/Collocation/Collocation.dsw: Redefined project
          dependencies.

        * tests/Collocation/Makefile.test:
        * tests/Collocation/Collocation.cpp:
        * tests/Collocation/main.cpp:
        * tests/Collocation/Collocation.dsp: Renamed <main.cpp> to
          <Collocation.cpp> so that both Win32 and UNIX build the same
          executable.

          Thanks to Carlos for pointing them out.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_close):
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_close):
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_close): The
          handle_close methods were not closing these Svc_Handler's down
          properly.  Removed "this->peer ()->close ()" calls and use
          "this->destroy () instead of calling "delete this."

Tue Apr 17 15:43:45 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/TIE/client.dsp: Removed FooS.* from project.

Tue Apr 17 13:03:49 2001  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/Transport.h (TAO_Synch_Refcountable): Reworked this so that
        the lock can be specified in the constructor.  This permits an
        optimization for single-threaded versions of the ORB so they can
        use a null lock implementation if desired and thus achieve better
        performance.  [Bug 861]

        * tao/Transport.cpp: Updated various methods to take advantage of
        the optimization outlined above.  Specifically, the TAO_Transport
        constructor now initializes its TAO_Synch_Refcountable's lock
        using the resource factory's create_cached_connection_lock(), just
        like TAO_Transport's handler_lock_ and the connection cache lock.
        Thanks to Joe Hoffert <joeh@cs.wustl.edu> and Bala
        <bala@cs.wustl.edu> for pointing out this opportunity and testing
        it via Quantify. [Bug 861]

Tue Apr 17 12:19:32 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp:

          Modified code that used != to compare two typecodes
          to use TypeCode::equal(). Also added TypeCode_vars
          to contain the results of CORBA::Any::type(). Thanks
          to Max Voronoy <m.voronoy@telesens.com.ua> for
          reporting the != bug.

        * examples/POA/Default_Servant/*.bor
          Added BCB makefiles for this test

Mon Apr 16 16:45:19 2001  Angelo Corsaro  <corsaro@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/RTCORBA/Client_Protocol/client.cpp:
          This test was printing a misleading error message.
          The problem has now been fixed.

Mon Apr 16 13:34:31 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/README: Generalize this a bit so that
          it fits in better with the ACE+TAO context.

Mon Apr 16 13:13:00 2001  Michael Kircher  <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

        * tao/IORTable/Makefile.bor:

          Fixed definitions of INCDIR_NAME to use backslash, as
          forward slash is interpreted as an option by copy on Win32.

Sun Apr 15 17:16:33 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tests/MT_Timeout/Client_Task.cpp (one_iteration):
          Relaxed the conditions to accept the elapsed time of each
          request.  Now we accept up to 30 milliseconds over the expected
          time as valid.

Sun Apr 15 15:31:00 2001 Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Modify_QoS/receiver.cpp:

          Fixed Fuzz error.

Sun Apr 15 14:03:00 2001 Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Asynch_Three_Stage/input:

          Added a new input file as the older one was too short to test
          all the different use cases in the run_test.pl. This was breaking
          the test on all platforms.

Sun Apr 15 12:13:00 2001 Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp:

          Removed unused method definitions which were breaking builds.

Sat Apr 14 23:57:01 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp:
          Reverted changes, they would not compile on any platform.

          the flows can be changed during run-time.

Sat Apr 14 19:31:56 2001  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp:

          Added modify_qos support to enable modifying the qos of the individual flows during run time.

Fri Apr 13 16:41:56 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Thread_Pool.cpp:
          More missing template instantiations, this time for builds with
          inline=0

Fri Apr 13 16:09:00 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Thread_Pool.cpp:
          Add enough template instantiations as to get gcc-2.95.2 happy
          with inlining.  More templates will be required later, but this
          will allow people to make progress.

Fri Apr 13 12:33:21 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated the release notes.

Fri Apr 13 11:14:46 2001  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Three_Stage/sender.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Simple_Three_Stage/run_test.pl:

          Added a timed orb->run () to prevent the sender from shutting
          down before the distributer connected to it. This should
          fix the breaking of the test on many platforms.


Fri Apr 13 10:50:46 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:

          Generation of set method for explicit default case had
          been overlooked for the member types interface, enum,
          and array. The typecode creation example uses an
          interface as the default member, and so uncovered this
          oversight. Also made cosmetic changes to source code
          and to generated code for the entire file.

Fri Apr 13 10:49:36 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/IORManipulation/IORTest.cpp: Fixed a small problem that
          was showing up in the builds as test failures. The test used the
          name of a machine "acme.cs.wustl.edu" for creating IOR's. Looks
          like the machine has been removed from the network. The creation
          of IOR's failed and hence the test.

Fri Apr 13 2:15:04 2001 Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Component_Switching/sender.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Component_Switching/distributer.cpp:

          Fixed compile errors on solaris.

Thu Apr 12 23:46:04 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Thread_Pool: Added classes to handle the creation of thread
          pools in TAO:

          - TAO_Thread_Pool_Threads: Class representing a thread running
            in a thread lane.

          - TAO_Thread_Lane: Class representing the thread lane inside a
            thread pool.

          - TAO_Thread_Pool: Class representing the thread pool inside a
            thread pool manager.

          - TAO_Thread_Pool_Manager: Class for managing thread pools.

        * tests/RTCORBA/Thread_Pool: New test for creating and using
          thread-pools in a MT server.

        * tao/RT_ORB.h: The RT_ORB now has a TAO_Thread_Pool_Manager class
          to create and manage thread pools.  All thread pool related
          methods are forwarded to TAO_Thread_Pool_Manager.

        * tao/ORB_Core: Because the RT_ORB now holds a pointer to its
          creating ORB, the RT members of ORB_Core had to be rearranged such
          that <rt_orb_> is before <orb_>.

        * tao/RT_ORB_Loader.cpp (create_object): RT_ORB constructor
          now requires that the orb reference be passed in.

        * File updates for new thread pool code and test:

          - tao/Makefile
          - tao/Makefile.bor

        * tests/Oneway_Buffering/server.dsp:
          Add project files for MSVC

        * tests/Oneway_Buffering/Test.idl:
          Made shutdown() operations reliable, a oneway shutdown operation
          is inadequate for this application, because they can be
          buffered.

        * tests/Oneway_Buffering/client.cpp:
          Fixed stupid typos.

Thu Apr 12 17:04:56 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.h (CORBA_ORB): Added a comment around destroy () for a
          possible case that is not supported in TAO.

Thu Apr 12 16:55:36 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Transport.cpp (close_connection): Fixed a problem where the
          reactor could be left with dangling references to the event
          handler.  This showed up from tests in
          $TAO_ROOT/tests/Reliable_Oneways. The source of the problem was
          that the client ORB while detecting a bad server closes the
          connection -- and hence the service handler for that connection
          by using handle_close (). As the reactor outlives the handler,
          the reactor happens to have the reference. When the ORB
          shutsdown, the reactor while trying to access the handler seg
          faults. Thanks to Chris Cleeland and Carlos O'Ryan for
          participating in the discussion for the right fix.

          Added Quantify hooks

        * performance-tests/Latency/st_server.conf:
        * performance-tests/Latency/st_client.conf:
          Moved "-ORBConnectionCacheLock null" from the default
          Resource_Factory to the Advanced_Resource_Factory.
          This was creating a mutex for a single-threaded app.
          There should never be both in a configuration file
          since the Advanced Resource Factory subsumes all the
          options of the default Resource Factory

          New test for oneway buffering.  Verify that buffers are not
          flushed before the constraints are reached, and that they are
          indeed flushed shortly after that.

        * tests/Reliable_Oneways/client.cpp:
          Use Messaging.h instead of MessagingC.h, a convention for
          CORBA-related namespaces is starting to appear: for each
          namespace an include file with the same name.

Thu Apr 12 12:07:05 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/ClientRequestInfo.cpp (request_id):
        * tao/PortableServer/ServerRequestInfo.cpp (request_id):

          reinterpret_cast to an "unsigned long" instead of CORBA::ULong
          since we need to first cast to an integer large enough to hold
          an address to avoid compile-time warnings on some 64-bit
          platforms.

Wed Apr 11 08:44:35 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp (dump_msg):

          Added missing comma in array of message type names.  Previously
          "MessageError" and "Fragment" were merged.

          Corrected format specifier for the request/reply ID in the dump
          message.  The request/reply ID is an unsigned long, so use the
          "%u" format specifier, not the "%d" int format specifier.

Wed Apr 11 07:40:10 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

Tue Apr 10 22:27:49 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/PortableServer/Servant_Base.cpp (synchronous_upcall_dispatch):

          Added a check before sending an exception reply, the same as
          the check made before sending the regular reply. The Reliable
          Oneways test showed that an exception thrown in the
          implementation was bypassing the SYNC_WITH_SERVER and other
          oneway logic that was in place for regular replies.

Tue Apr 10 11:08:03 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp (open):
          Workaround what appears to be a bug in the Linux TCP/IP stack.
          Here is the scenario: a server starts on a kernel selected port,
          a client makes oneway requests to this server, eventually the
          server shutdown or crashes, but the client continues to make
          requests.
          Now, suppose the port selected for the server was 12345, the
          local address for the client sockets are also randomly selected,
          but if you keep trying to make requests eventually the client
          will select 12345 as its *local* port.
          Here is were things get weird: the kernel will connect() that
          port successfully!  There is no server *listening* on that port,
          it just happens that the local address and the destination
          address are the same.
          That's clearly wrong, to reproduce the problem run the
          Reliable_Oneways test with a *lot* of iterations and
          -ORBDebugLevel 1, for example:
              $ server &
              $ client -n -i 50000 -ORBDebugLevel 1
          the change I'm commiting now will detect the weird problem and
          print out a message.

Tue Apr 10 10:45:26 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tao/PortableInterceptor.i (send_request, receive_reply,
          receive_other, receive_exception,
          receive_request_service_contexts, receive_request, send_reply,
          send_other, send_exception):

          Moved these interception points to the
          `PortableInterceptor.cpp'.  They were too big to be inlined, so
          there was no point in leaving them in this inline source file.

          (receive_exception, send_exception):

          Fixed problem where the remaining interceptors in the flow stack
          were not invoked if an exception was thrown from either of these
          interception points.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (get_listen_point):

          Use CORBA::String_var to improve exception safety, and simplify
          the code.

          Improved performance of this method by comparing the numerical
          forms of the IP addresses for equality rather than the
          stringified IP addresses or hostnames.  This saves the cost of a
          strcmp().

          Another performance improvement: don't bother creating a
          temporary IIOP::ListenPoint and then copying it to the
          IIOP::ListenPointList.  Just use the one that was already
          created in the IIOP::ListenPointList.

          Fixed busted code that casted away the const-ness of the
          pointer to the INET_Addr array in the IIOP_Acceptor so that it
          could be used as a temporary (modifiable!) variable.  Since a
          temporary INET_Addr was needed, just create one rather than
          butchering what is supposed to be an immutable set of
          INET_Addrs.

          (send):

          Use the peer's send_n() method instead of ACE::send_n().  This
          is makes it clearer to pluggable protocol implementors that
          ACE::send_n() should not always be used to when implementing
          this method.  For example, SSLIOP doesn't use ACE::send_n()
          since the data being sent must be encrypted.

        * tao/Invocation.h:
        * tao/Invocation.cpp (generate_request_id):

          New method for generating request IDs.  It generates a request
          ID based on the address of the TAO_GIOP_Invocation object.  The
          address is guaranteed to be unique within the process.  This
          makes it possible to generate a request ID without acquiring a
          lock, which in turn allows to remove a lock from the critical
          path.  Neat, huh? :-)  Things are slightly more complicated on
          platforms with 64-bit addresses.  On those platforms, we do some
          bit manipulation and extract a 32-bit value from that address.
          If all else fails, we fall back on the traditional request ID
          generator that increments a CORBA::ULong atomically (i.e. by
          acquiring a lock).  [Bug 826]

          (start):

          Obtain a request ID from the new generate_request_id() method.

        * tao/operation_details.h:

          Cosmetic update.

        * tao/operation_details.i (modify_request_id):

          Do not adjust even-ness or odd-ness of the request ID by first
          multiplying by two.  It is not safe to do that since the request
          ID may have been based on the address of the TAO_GIOP_Invocation
          object (due to the above changes).  In fact, it wasn't really
          safe to multiply by two before the request ID optimization since
          doing so may actually cause another outstanding request ID to be
          re-used.  Simply incrementing by one when appropriate is safer.

        * tao/Asynch_Invocation.h:
        * tao/Asynch_Invocation.cpp (generate_request_id):

          Generate a request ID based on the address of the
          TAO_Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher object.  This is basically the same
          optimization used in TAO_GIOP_Invocation.  However, in the case
          of AMI we need to used the TAO_Asynch_Reply_Dispatcher object
          since it exists for the duration of the request, whereas the
          Invocation object doesn't.

        * tao/Sequence.i (length):

          Optimized unbounded sequence growth.  The internal buffer (hence
          the maximum) now generally grows to twice the amount of the
          previous maximum unless the desired length is larger than that
          (doubled) value.  The number of allocations and copies for large
          numbers of small sequence length increases has been reduced
          significantly by this optimization.  For example, 8 sequence
          length increases of 1 previously caused 8 allocations to occur
          and 28 copies.  The new scheme reduces those numbers to 4
          allocations and 7 copies.  This change should make insertion
          constant on the average (similar to an STL vector).  [Bug 757]

        * tao/PortableServer/ServerRequestInfo.cpp (request_id):

          Generate a request ID based on the address of the
          TAO_ServerRequest object.  The request ID generated by this
          method need not be the same as the GIOP request ID sent with the
          request.  It just needs to be unique within a given process.
          This is the same trick used in the TAO_GIOP_Invocation object
          described above.  [Bug 826]

        * orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo/IFR_Test/Admin_Client.cpp:

          Changed some _tc_nulls to _tc_voids, as in the above item.

        * tao/TypeCodeFactory/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:
        * tao/TypeCodeFactory/TypeCodeFactory_i.h:

          Added several validation checks for parameters passed into
          the typecode creation methods. The spec lists criteria for
          valid names, ids, member and content types, discriminator
          types, and default label types. It also requires that
          member names and label values be unique. There is a specific
          combination of exception and minor code to be thrown for
          the failure to meet each of these criteria. All that is in
          place now.

          The endpoint string is no longer passed to Profile
          constructors.  Previously, this string was passed to the
          Profile's constructor at which point TAO_Profile::parse_string()
          was called from within that constructor.  However,
          parse_string() can throw an exception.  Since emulated
          exceptions cannot reproduce the semantics of throwing an
          exception within a constructor, it is a very bad idea to invoke
          such a method within a constructor.  TAO's pluggable protocol
          framework now invokes the parse_string() method directly.  This
          change has the added benefit of allowing the removal of one
          constructor.  There are way too many to begin with.

        * tao/ORBInitInfo.cpp (register_initial_reference):

          This method is only valid during pre_init(), i.e. only before
          TAO_ORB_Core::init() has been called.  The ORB Core starts out
          in the "shutdown" state, so checking if it is in that state
          would indicate that the ORB hasn't been initalized yet, at least
          partially, meaning that initial reference registration can
          proceed.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (list_initial_references):

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Connector.h:
        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Connector.cpp:

          In the first implementation I used a really slow lookup
          of used client connection handlers based on strings, now
          I use the hash () method of the ACE_INET_Addr directly.

          Thanks to Carlos for giving me that hint - I knew there
          was a faster way than comparing strings ;-)

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Transport.h:
        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Transport.cpp:

          Made use of the possiblity to set the initial size of the
          input CDR buffer. In combination with the single read strategy,
          which tries to read as much as the buffer can take, it is now
          possible to read a complete UDP packet on a single read without
          any hacks ;-) Thanks to Bala for allowing me to extend
          the constructors of GIOP_Message_Base et al.

          only a single client server oneway invocations.

          oneway performance.

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Handler.cpp:

          Added a new parameter to the constructor. This parameter can
          be used to set the underlying input CDR stream buffer size.
          As the transport instantiates these classes, the input CDR
          buffer size can be controlled this way. The parameter
          has a default value of ACE_CDR::DEFAULT_BUFSIZE.
          GIOP_Message_Base forwards this parameter to GIOP_Message_Handler,
          which is reponsible for the input CDR strream, this triggered
          the change in GIOP_Message_Handler.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp:

          Improve the basic (default) filter builder so that it
          works with logical AND and bitmask filters.  Note that
          the nesting of filters in the basic filter builder is
          still limited, but this allows more of the "new" filters
          to be used with this builder.

          I tested this by running the Complex and Bitmask tests
          from orbsvcs/tests/Event/Basic using the -ECFiltering basic
          option.

          To make a long story short: the invocation class called
          close_connection() that acquires the transport mutex, then
          called handle_close on its underlying event handler, that turned
          around and tried to call connection_handler_closing(), but that
          tries to acquire the mutex again.

          In the case in which the POA had set the NON RETAIN policy the
          collocation optimization was not taking place, the problem was
          caused by the fact that we were testing for a non null servant.
          This bug has been now fixed, and collocation will work as
          expected even if the POA has the NON RETAIN policy set.

          If the debug level is set to zero, and the ImplRepo is
          run as an NT service when the registry keys specific to

          of outside of it.

        * tao/Sequence_T.cpp:

          Made a fix to the assignment operator in unbounded array
          sequences similar to the one made to generic unbounded
          sequences in

        * Sequence_T.i:

          Made fixes to the get_buffer method in generic unbounded
          sequences and unbounded array sequences similar to the
          change above. Thanks to Virgilijus Globis <virgis@megagis.lt>
          for pointing this out.

Thu Apr  5 18:35:23 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/*/README: Changed the README files to

        * tao/PolicyC.h: Added a missing Environment.h. This should fix
          problems in  TRU64_XX builds and SunCC builds.

Thu Apr  5 13:50:00 2001  Michael Kircher <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * tao/Wait_On_Leader_Follower.cpp:

          Carlos and I worked on a fix for [Bug 842]. This involves
          electing a new leader if a follower got elected but
          concurrently also received a timeout. In such cases
          a dead-lock could occur, but this fix prevents it
          from happening, as the leaving follower elects a new
          leader, as itself cannot fulfill that role.

          Such situations are detected by the condition that
          a timeout occured, remove_follower fails and reply_received
          equals 0. This fix applies exactly in such situations.

Thu Apr  5 13:09:33 2001  Mayur Deshpande <mayur@ics.uci.edu>

        * docs/tutorials/Quoter/Simple/Impl-Repo/index.html:

          an extra ImplRepoService to $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service
          path. Thanks to John Ashmun <John.ASHMUN@esca.com> for reporting
          this.

          Some code was not protected by TAO_HAS_AMI_CALLBACK or
          TAO_HAS_AMI_POLLABLE, however, it could not compile in
          configurations missing both options.
          Luckily only the VxWorks build was failing due to this problem.

Thu Apr  5 12:22:33 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Transport.h (TAO_Transport):
        * tao/Transport.cpp:
        * tao/Transport.inl:
          Changed the name of the methods send_request_header () and
          start_locate ()  as generate_request_header () and
          generate_locate_request (). Removed the method start_request
          (). This was not doing anything and was a dummy call. The
          methods generate_request_header () and generate_locate_request
          () are not virtual calls like their originals. They have now
          been moved to the TAO_Transport class. Added a virtual method
          messaging_object () that would return the underlyging messaging
          object to the TAO_Transport class.

          Removed the argument TAO_ORB_Core from the
          generate_locate_request () as the argument served no
          purpose. The reason it was still there seems to be more
          historical. The messaging_object that could be using it has a
          copy of the pointer to the TAO_ORB_Core.

          The above changes also address some of the comments left for me
          in the Transport classes.

          Refactored endpoint selector factory code into
          these new files as part of the RTCORBA subsetting
          project.

        * tao/Invocation_Endpoint_Selectors.{cpp,h,i}:
        * tao/RT_Invocation_Endpoint_Selectors.{cpp,h}:
          Moved almost all RT specific code from
          Invocation_Endpoint_Selectors.*

        * tao/ORB_Core.{cpp,h,i}:
          Moved endpoint selectors from ORB_Core to the
          factory objects.  Removed most RT endpoint selector
          code except for the initialization of the endpoint
          selector factory object.

        * tao/Invocation.{cpp,h,i}:
          Miscellaneous changes to work with the above

        * tao/ORB.h:

        * examples/TypeCode_Creation/Makefile:

          Excluded the create_*_tc functions from minimum CORBA
          builds, and modified the example makefile accordingly.
          Thanks to Carlos for finding the spec's reference to
          these functions re minimum CORBA in a rather
          unexpected location.

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/IFR_TypeCodes.cpp:

          Reverted change in previous entry. The typedef and typecode
          for ContextIdentifier weren't missing after all.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Options.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Options.h:

          Added a -l option to the ImplRepo_Service that
          specifies that the service is "locked" and the
          startup/service info cannot be changed. [Bug 666]

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/tao_imr_i.cpp:

          Changed the return codes returned by tao_imr to be
          more specific based on the exception.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/locked/run_test.pl: (added)

          Test the locked option of the ImplRepo_Service.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/NameService/run_test.pl:

          Found an error in this script in that the return
          values of tao_imr wasn't being checked correctly.

        * utils/NamingViewer/NamingViewer.dsp:

          Since it isn't really possible to compile this
          example with UNICODE defined, I hid it from the
          auto builds by changing the configuration names.

        * tao/BiDir_Adapter.h:
        * tao/TypeCodeFactory_Adapter.h: Included Exception.h in place of
          corbafwd.h. Builds with exceptions=1 like Core builds on Redhat
          were complaining about incomplete type for
          CORBA::SystemException.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.i: Removed the #include of BiDir_Adapter.h from
          ORB_Core.h and moved it to ORB_Core.cpp. Forward declared that
          class in the .h file. Moved the method that is dependant on the
          include in .h file, from .i file to .cpp file -- basically
          uninlined that method. The method is not on the critical path
          and so shouldn't matter.

          Another iteration in the process of moving the interceptors to
          the .cpp file.
          This time we remove the ACE_NESTED_CLASS() macros, because now
          the interceptors are always generated on a separate namespace.
          Eliminating the macros removed the need for a sub_state, and I
          was able to remove 1000 lines of code from the IDL compiler.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_prepoc.cpp:
          Don't predefine IDL because this is a legal IDL identifier.
          Instead we predefine __TAO_IDL and set it to the current ACE
          version.  Thanks to Stelios Sfakianakis <ssfak@ics.forth.gr> for
          pointing out this problem.

        * tao/corba.h:
          Remove "tao/ClientRequestInfo.h" from the #included files,
          this file is no longer required in the generated code headers.

        * tao/ClientRequestInfo.h:
          Made a few helper methods public instead of protected or
          private.  We were generating 'friend' declarations for every
          class using them, so they were public for all practical
          purposes.
          I don't think any fears of 'accidental' missuse are well
          founded:  the application uses the base class
          (PortableInterceptors::ClientRequestInfo), so gaining access to
          those fields would require a downcast to a TAO proprietary
          interface, anybody doing that can go an step further too, and
          access the private fields anyway.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          Add helper method to generate #include directive, removed a lot
          of duplicate code using that.
          Move the #includes related to interceptors from the header files
          to the .cpp files.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_ss.cpp:

          Complete the change that moves interceptor helper classes
          (per-operation ClientRequestInfo and ServerRequestInfo) to the
          .cpp file.

        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/Transport.cpp:

          Added in send_i to check for the ACE_MAX_DGRAM_SIZE. If
          messages are larger than that, they are simply swallowed,
          nothing is sent. If we find a proper expection to throw,
          we can change that code to throw an exception.

          Also, left some comments for debugging, as they are currently
          needed to fix a bug.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation/interceptors_ss.h:
          Moved all the interceptor helper classes to the .cpp file.  This
          will speed up compilation just a tiny little bit, but more
          importantly, it will allow us to regenerate PolicyC.cpp without
          any cycles in the #include hierarchy.

        * tao/PortableServer/MessagingS.h:
        * tao/diffs/MessagingS.h.diff:
          Fixed another '#pragma pop', but this one was only a problem on
          Borland with messaging disabled!  If Jeff hadn't spot this
          visually we would have never caugh the problem.

Mon Apr  2 20:08:07 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp:

          Added a check to each create_*_tc method. If the
          creation of the service object instance fails, a null
          typecode pointer will be returned, avoiding the crash

        * tao/TypeCodeFactory/TypeCodeFactory_i.cpp:

          In the utility function that computes a default index for

          In summary, fixing two bugs (1) the incorrect generation of
          T_var for anonymous types, and (2) updating MessagingC.* with
          the latest version of the IDL compiler, exposed another bug!
          (3) Using anonymous T_vars in the AMI code.

          The fix was to *not* use a T_var at all, in fact, there was no
          reason to heap allocate this object, it could be created on the
          stack without any problems.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/ami_exception_holder_operation_cs.cpp:
          The generated code was missing an ACE_CHECK statement.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/smart_proxy_cs.cpp:
          Fixed indentation problem in generated code

          Removed unused and undefined but exported CDR operators for
          Messaging::ExceptionHolder::_tao_seq_Octet, this is obviously a
          problem in the IDL compiler!  However, I should have noticed
          that it was removed in previous versions of this file.

        These changes were first given out as a custom patch to TAO
        1.1.14 to Oresis.  They've been tested there, and seem to minimize
        ORB leaks.

        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.h:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connection_Handler.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connection_Handler.h:
        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Connection_Handler.h:

        Changed pending_upcalls_ to be a signed quantity rather than
        unsigned.  There still seems to be a lingering condition whereby
        this value can get decremented "below" zero.  It's much easier to
        detect this situation when it's signed than unsigned.

        * tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/UIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * examples/PluggableUDP/DIOP/DIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:

        (open) Added code to set the transport's id.

        (handle_close) Changed conditional on pending_upcalls_ from "equal
        to zero" to "less than or equal to zero" in order to accomodate
        the lingering condition outlined above.

        (handle_input_i) This now returns -1 when pending_upcalls_ falls
        below or equal to zero.  This takes care of the situation outlined
        in the header file entry above.

          a roundtrip timeout policy.  The test currently deadlocks, while
          it should terminate in a relatively short amount of time.

          TypeCodeFactoryinterface has been made local. The stub files

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Base.pidl:

          Piece of Interface.pidl containing IFR abstract base interfaces
          and some non-interface datatypes used by all interfaces.

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Basic.pidl:

          Piece of Interface.pidl containing all interfaces and related
          datatypes, except those related to fixed types valuetypes and
          CORBA components.

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Extended.pidl:

          Piece of Interface.pidl containing interfaces and related
          datatypes pertaining to fixed types and valuetypes.

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_Components.pidl:

        * tao/IFR_Client/IFR_ExtendedC.i:

          Stub files generated from the above .pidl files. The motivation
          for this split of .pidl files and generated files is twofold.
          First, the stub files are now much smaller. Their former huge
          size was causing extra long compile and link times, as well as
          extreme memory requirements. Second, this scheme will simplify
          further modularization in the future.

          Removed from IFR_Client directory.

        * tao/IFR_Client/Interface.pidl:

          Kept around to show the entire IFR interface in one
          piece (except for TypeCodeFactory) with annotations
          showing the differences between the CORBA 2.x version
          and the CORBA Components version.

          Instead of using std::cout & friends we use good ol' cout, this
          avoids problems with all those platforms where ACE is configured
          to use the OLD iotstreams.
          Also remove the #include <iostream> line, because it gives MSVC
          fits (for good reasons).

          bug 189.
          Also cleaned up the IDL interface.

Wed Mar 28 16:39:13 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * tao/Messaging.h:
          We continue to add explicity headers for each CORBA namespace,
          until recently the "tao/corba.h" file automagically #included
          everything in CORBA, resulting in long compilation times,
          polluted namespaces and excessive coupling.
          Long ago we moved PortableServer to its own header file, and
          more recently RT_CORBA, this is another step.
          Notice that this is only relevant for platforms that define
          TAO_HAS_INTERCEPTORS=0, otherwise some other magic kicks in and
          re-introduces the magic header files.

          class now stores TAO_Service_Context instead of
          IOP::ServiceContextList.  Made changes to access the

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
          Removed warning when multicast is not enabled.

        * orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/RtEC_Based/Makefile:
          Don't build these examples on VxWorks; they aren't linking
          due to library conflicts.

        * orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/Simple/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEvent/Basic/Makefile:
          Remove unnecessary libraries from link line.  This was causing
          failures under VxWorks.

        * orbsvcs/examples/Notify/Filter/Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/examples/Notify/Subscribe/Subscribe.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/NT_Naming_Service.cpp:
          Borland uses the standard scope rules for variables declared

Wed Mar 28 09:31:54 2001  Frank Hunleth <fhunleth@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_i.cpp:
          Added #if ACE_HAS_PURIFY == 1 checks to initialize some
          structures before they are used.  This just removes the
          100,000+ warnings with Purify that the cubit clients and
          servers give.  This should be ok since any performance
          measurements have ACE_HAS_PURIFY == 0 anyway.

          Added portable interceptor code to verify that the client
          propagated priority is passed in the service context list
          back from the server.

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/Service_Context_Manipulation/interceptors.cpp:
          Added Ossama's changes to replicate Bug #806.  Also added many
          checks to verify the functionality of the service context
          manipulation methods for requests and replies, and added checks
          to verify that proper service context list contents are received
          from both the client and the server.  The test no longer relies
          on visual inspection of the results to show proper execution.

          using the TAO_Service_Context class.

Tue Mar 27 19:37:58 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Add macros to customize the default extensions for the IDL
          compiler:  IDL_CLIENT_SRC_EXT, IDL_CLIENT_HDR_EXT and similar
          macros for the other files.
          Likewise setting tao_dont_use_idl_make_rule=1 disables the
          default IDL compiler rules altogether, letting application
          developers define their own.

          Thanks to Jody Hagins <jody@atdesk.com> for all these
          improvements.

        * tests/Client_Leaks/Client_Task.h:
        * tests/Client_Leaks/Client_Task.cpp:
          Use the _non_existent trick to avoid TRANSIENT exceptions during
          startup.
          Count the number of calls that actually work, so the test fails
          if not enough child processes are created.

        * tests/Client_Leaks/Process_Factory.cpp:
          Cosmetic fixes

        * tao/Wait_On_Leader_Follower.cpp: Added an ACE_TEXT () wrapper
          for a debug statement. Thanks to Pratt Nick for poiting this
          out.

        * tao/Leader_Follower.{h,cpp,i}: Reverted the changes for Bug
          #721. Looks like the fix is causing the ORB to crash.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp: Changed

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp (destroy): Must check for a
          non-zero protocol object before destroying it.  We must also
          destroy the protocol objects in the reverse flowspec set.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams:

          - Rename Use_Case to Component_Switching.

          - Rename Simple to Simple_Two_Stage.

          - Revamped the following tests:

            - Simple_Two_Stage
            - Simple_Three_Stage
            - Asynch_Three_Stage
            - Component_Switching

        * Leader_Follower.{i,h,cpp}
        * Wait_On_Leader_Follower.cpp

          Implemented the Leader_Follower component of the ORB to use a
          stack instead of a heap, using the same strategy as in
          ACE_Token. This fixes Bug 721.

        * tao/Sequence_T.h:
        * tao/Sequence_T.cpp:

          Changed the assignment operator from T_var for
          class TAO_Object_Manager to take a const T_var &.
          The non-const parameter we had previously has
          incorrect semantics and may cause the wrong
          assignment operator (from T *) to be chosen by the
          compiler in some cases, leading to problems because
          the assignment from T * does not duplicate the
          pointer. Thanks to Matt Cheers <Matt.Cheers@Australia.Boeing.com>
          and Derek Dominish <Derek.Dominish@Australia.Boeing.com> for
          pointing out the problem.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/NT_Naming_Service.cpp: Added a patch
          to make it possible to pass multiple arguments to the
          NT_Naming_Service.  Thanks to Martin Johnson
          <mjhn@bigpond.net.au> for reporting this.

        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/corbafwd.h:
          Do not include "tao/ORB_Core.h", "tao/Stub.h" nor "tao/debug.h"
          from corba.h, this eliminates coupling between the library and
          the application, and improves compilation time by, according to
          my local tests, a good 10-20%.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_defn.cpp:

          Changed generated code for the
          static const CORBA::Long _oc_*[] array to put each member
          on a new line, eliminating the extremely long line lengths
          that were generated previously. This will also enable the
          generated comments that describe the various typecode
          components (name, repo id, member count, etc.) to be
          easily visible and readable in the text editor of your
          choice.

        * tests/IDL_Test/union.idl:

          Changed case labels for the union with a wchar discriminator
          to values which map to some displayable char value. This
          was causing a problem on QNX. Thanks to
          Mayur Deshpande <mayur@balar.ece.uci.edu> for reporting this.
