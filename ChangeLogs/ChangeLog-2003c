Wed Jan 14 18:45:46 2004  Balachandran  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE version 5.4 released.

Wed Jan 14 17:17:41 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile:

          Fixed the path to some of autoconf files. Hopefully this should
          be the last bug.

Wed Jan 14 16:28:28 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/make_release:

          Fixed a bug with the way we were collecting the list of files
          for making the ACE distribution.

Wed Jan 14 16:13:33 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile:

          Added RELEASE_FILES to the AUTOCONF_RELEASE_FILES.

Wed Jan 14 14:26:54 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/make_release:

          Made changes to the way beta kits are created. We added some
          solution files and WinCE files for ACE but not for TAO+CIAO
          (with a reason). But when the final kits were created, the
          ACE+TAO bundles and ACE+TAO+CIAO bundles had all the ACE
          specific stuff which confused the user. Moreover, the autoconf
          support was also bootstrapped which confused users to no end
          since autoconf works only with ACE. The bootstrapping should have
          been done to the ACE distribution and not to other
          distributions.

        * Makefile:

          Added an extra target for AUTOCONF_RELEASE_FILES. This will have
          all the release files in ACE + the files that needs to go in
          with autoconf.

          I have to test this stuff and will do so shortly.

Wed Jan 14 09:47:56 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * */*_Static.ds[p,w]:

          All the Win32 static projects and workspaces have been
          removed. Please use MPC to generate them.

Wed Jan 14 07:32:32 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for spotting a typo in the file.

Tue Jan 13 22:42:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile (RELEASE_FILES):

          Added `aclocal.m4' and `Makefile.in' to the list of files to be
          included in releases/kits.  This should be the last of them.

Tue Jan 13 21:39:30 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

          Removed aux and configure from the CONTROLLED_FILES section and
          moved it to the RELEASE_FILES section.

Tue Jan 13 16:33:12 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

          Added `aux' directory to the list of controlled files.  It is a
          directory generated at autotool bootstrap-time via the
          bin/bootstrap script, and must be available in order for ACE's
          autoconf support to work.

          Added `configure' to the list of controlled files.  Users can't
          run the `configure' script if it isn't shipped with the
          distribution.

        * bin/bootstrap:

          Invoke `autoreconf' without the "--symlink" option.  Auxiliary
          files should be copied into the distribution, not symbolic
          pointing to them.

        * bin/make_release:

          Prepend "/usr/local/bin" to the GNU tool path.  That directory
          on our release host now contains some specific versions of GNU
          autotools.

Tue Jan 13 16:42:37 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Correct the autoconf section to direct the user
          to create a subdirectory under ACE_wrappers. Thanks to Ossama for
          pointing this out.
          Also changed the traditional make section to advise user to
          create config.h and platform_macros.GNU files and include the
          platform file rather than link or copy the platform file.

Tue Jan 13 16:19:29 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Client.mpc:

          Fixed a dependancy issue.

Tue Jan 13 11:28:21 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

          Added `configure.ac' file to the list of controlled files.

        * configure.ac:

          Corrected problem where std::auto_ptr<>::reset() method was not
          detected properly in the !ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB
          case.

        * bin/make_release:

          Bootstrap autotool support prior to creating the kits via the
          new bootstrap_autotools() subroutine described below.

          Appended Emacs "Local Variables" block containing Perl mode to
          end of this file to force Perl mode instead Fundamental mode to
          be used by default when editing with Emacs.

          (create_kit):

          Moved autotool bootstrapping call to new bootstrap_autotools()
          subroutine.

          (bootstrap_autotools):

          New subroutine that bootstraps autotool support into the ACE
          distribution.

Tue Jan 13 18:06:23 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Only assign LIB_INSTALL to INSTALL if INSTALL has not yet been
          defined.  This will allow users to continue turning off
          installation of libraries by setting INSTALL= prior to including
          rules.local.GNU.  Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>
          for pointing this out.  Normally, the INS* variables can be used
          for this purpose, since they work for each target type.

Mon Jan 12 23:26:28 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added new commandline flag, static_link.  It defaults to 0, but
          can be set =1 to force static linking, e.g., uses "-static" when
          linking with GNU ld.  It's turned off by default since using it
          causes the footprint to go up by almost 1 MB, due to linking all
          the system and compiler .a files.  This way the user can decide
          if that what they really want.  Thanks to Bala for helping to
          formulate this policy, which matches what users expect, while
          adding the capability to do real static linking if you want to.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Moved the assignment of the STATIC_LINK_FLAG from rules.bin to
          rules.local so that it will get picked up even if rules.bin is
          not included (MPC and some Makefiles with multiple targets don't
          include rules.bin).  Only add the STATIC_LINK_FLAG to LDFLAGS
          if static_libs_only=1.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:
          Removed default assignment of STATIC_LINK_FLAG to empty, since
          it's now controlled with the new static_link flag above.  It
          still won't work on Solaris, but at least users wanting to use
          it will get an error instead of us silently not adding "-static".

Mon Jan 12 17:52:17 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Add a section for using GNU autoconf.

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/Futures.cpp: Don't delete all work
          requests; only the Exit requests - the others are allocated on
          the stack. Thanks to Andy Harvey <agh@cisco.com> for this fix.

Mon Jan 12 14:24:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Makefile.am: Remove $(libdir) from libTest_Output.la listed
          in dependencies - having it there caused it to not match the
          plain libTest_Output.la target in the Makefile, and thus not
          get built before many of the tests. Added libTest_Output.la to
          the DLL_Test and Service_Config_Test dependencies.

Mon Jan 12 15:54:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS/server/jaws.dsp:
          Fixed incorrect macro name.

Mon Jan 12 08:06:07 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Print out a warning if a verbatim clause is processed (depending
          on the project type) and the marker is not found in the
          corresponding project template.

Mon Jan 12 01:38:44 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * apps/soreduce/Library.cpp:

          Fixed a compile erros with VC 6 which cannot scope variables
          within for loops.

Mon Jan 12 01:35:44 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Fixed the path ane the name of a couple of dsp files in the CORE
          builds. This should fix two problems with static builds.

Sat Jan 10 22:39:59 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          The following patch modifies the file so that it can handle
          multiple path elements in the  argument given to
          create_ace_build.pl. Thanks to  John Poplett
          <John_Poplett@3com.com> for providing the patches.

Sat Jan 10 19:35:20 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Added missing dsp files for compilation to the static lib
          builds. The failure of te static builds is due to something
          else, which wil be fixed shortly in the autobuilds.

Sat Jan 10 17:36:45 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/Performance_Test_Options.cpp:

          Fixed warnings with Forte 8.

Sat Jan 10 17:11:03 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added generation for custom build step dependency on the
          IDL or CIDL compiler executable. This enables the build to
          detect errors output by the (C)IDL compiler, and also will
          trigger the custom build step if the (C)IDL compiler has
          been updated.

Sat Jan 10 16:14:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (closesocket): On HP-UX, use
          shutdown() before, and in addition to, close() to close a socket.
          The previous "fix" left the socket opened after shutdown().

        * tests/Bug_1576_Regression_Test.cpp: Use ACE_DLL_SUFFIX to form the
          name of the bogus dll name instead of literal ".so". Prevents a
          run-time warning from platforms that use a different suffix, such
          as HP-UX.

        * tests/Makefile.am: Removed -module from the libTestOutput line
          so it actually links the library for use by other tests. Added
          TSS_Static_Test_SOURCES to have it build as well.

Sat Jan 10 11:18:24 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-lite.h:
        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp: Added /**/ to #include to keep MSVC from
          complaining it can't find a file.

        * ace/Array_Base.cpp: The _MSC_VER check need not be done for CE
          compiler - it doesn't need the extra #include and doesn't have <new>.

Fri Jan  9 16:55:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Timers/Alarm.cpp:
        * examples/APG/ThreadManagement/Coop_Cancel.cpp:
        * examples/APG/ThreadManagement/Signals.cpp:
        * examples/APG/ThreadManagement/Signals2.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Sockets/Server.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Reactor/Timers.cpp: Added ACE_NOTREACHED to
          unreachable statements to kill compile warnings.

Fri Jan  9 16:27:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Streams/Answerer.cpp: Removed unnecessary template
          instantiations.

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/Futures.cpp:
        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/ThreadPool.cpp: Fixed memory leak. Thanks
          to Andy Harvey <agh@cisco.com> for reporting these.

Fri Jan  9 15:24:30 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Support for STLPort in ACE Makefile system. Thanks to
          John Poplett <John_Poplett@3com.com> for the patches.

Fri Jan  9 20:13:21 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
          Set the default (blank) value of STATIC_LINK_FLAG in
          rules.bin.GNU and only set it in platform_g++_common.GNU if it
          hasn't been set.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:
          Set STATIC_LINK_FLAG blank to prevent platform_g++_common.GNU
          from setting it to "-static", since this flag doesn't work on Sun.

Fri Jan  9 11:15:16 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a .PHONY target to stop GNU Make from trying to build
          targets that happen to coincide with cpp files.

Fri Jan  9 14:46:54 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Test_Output_Export.h:
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Fri Jan  9 13:12:07 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:
          Corrected the check for Use_MPC.

Fri Jan  9 12:23:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          Set dummy_label to 0. This dummy_label is used by the TAO OBV
          tests which don't compile because of some bugs. The idea was
          good, but when dummy_label is not in this file it is set by
          default to 1. When the OBV tests work again, just remove the
          requires from the corresponding MPC files.

Fri Jan  9 12:14:05 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:
          Build FTORB_Utils before PortableGroup

Fri Jan  9 10:15:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:
          When using MPC with Static builds we don't have dependencies
          between the libraries in the generated dsw's. The build order
          is then handled in this file, but when using MPC we use generate
          different filenames than previously. Added the option -MPC, when
          this is passed on the commandline we use the MPC filenames.

Fri Jan  9 08:07:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS/server/jaws.dsp:
          This project doesn't use a separate dll for the jaws stuff, so set
          ACE_HAS_SVC_DLL to 0.

Thu Jan  8 18:28:35 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/APG/Streams/CommandStream.h:

          Fixed a warning with g+++ builds that were caused by wrong
          initialization order of members.

Thu Jan  8 18:15:21 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Timers/Alarm.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Timers/Task.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Timers/Upcall.cpp: Add missing template instantiations.

Thu Jan  8 15:15:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Streams/Answerer.cpp (RecordingStream::open): Change
          the signature to match the inherited ACE_Stream::open() method to
          allow easy configuration without forcing a EndTask module.

        * examples/APG/Streams/CommandStream.{h cpp}: Move the ACE_SOCK_Stream*
          argument from open() to the constructor, and make default ctor
          private to force passage of the ACE_SOCK_Stream*. Change open() to
          properly inherit from ACE_Stream, avoiding the "hides inherited
          open()" diagnostics, and making this class easier to use in
          different use cases.

        * examples/APG/Streams/RecordingDevice_Text.cpp: Changed usage of
          CommandStream class to match new API, above.

        * examples/APG/Streams/Command.h:
        * examples/APG/Streams/CommandTask.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Streams/CommandTasks.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Streams/RecordingDevice_Text.cpp: Prepended RESULT_
          to the enumerators SUCCESS, PASS, FAIL; prepended CMD_ to the
          enumerators UNKNOWN, ANSWER_CALL, RETRIEVE_CALLER_ID, PLAY_MESSAGE,
          RECORD_MESSAGE. These were done to avoid clashes with commonly
          defined macros. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Thu Jan  8 20:15:09 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Reactor/Misc/test_demuxing.cpp:
          Made this example compiling with BCB.

Thu Jan  8 14:05:42 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Misc/Makefile:

          Fixed a bild error in our daily builds. Thanks to Don for
          helping with this. The change just involved removing
          shared_libs=0  from the Makefile.

Thu Jan  8 18:35:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Just set the four xx_DIRS we overrule always to . independent of the
          configuration that the we always output to the same directory

Thu Jan  8 12:20:23 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:

          Changed the default command line from '--lem-file-suffix E.idl'
          (since this is now the default suffix) to one that includes
          the four include paths required by the inclusion of
          Components.idl, which is needed by every .cidl file.

Thu Jan  8 12:03:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Timers/TimerDispatcher.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Timers/PTimerDispatcher.cpp: Added missing template
          instantiations.

Thu Jan  8 17:05:56 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS/server/HTTP_Server.{h,cpp}:
        * apps/JAWS/server/server.mpc:
          Made this app compiling with CBX and MPC. Set the correct defines
          and use the correct export macros.

Thu Jan  8 17:02:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Corrected setting of STATIC_DIR

Thu Jan  8 11:23:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Naming/Name_Binding.h:
        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Grapher.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Monitor.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Monitor2.cpp: Add missing
          "ace/OS_NS_*" includes.

        * examples/APG/Naming/Graphable_Element.h: Added 'const' to the when()
          and operator<() methods, as well as to operator<()'s parameters,
          to match less<> and make CBuilderX happy. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          for reporting this.

        * examples/APG/Naming/Makefile: Moved the "RM tempinc" up before the
          sub-make to avoid inadvertant smashing of tempinc.

        * examples/APG/Proactor/HA_Proactive_Status.cpp (validate_connection):
          Removed the parameter names in the ACE_WIN32 case to avoid "unused
          parameter" warnings.

Thu Jan  8 11:05:25 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_msg.inl:

          Used a const cast instead of a static cast.

Thu Jan  8 16:38:56 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Export.h:
          Set the JAWS_HAS_DLL define correctly when not set. This fixes
          the linker errors in the CBX MPC build.

Thu Jan  8 16:16:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Date_Time.i:
          Changed the order of the methods to fix Tru64 warnings.

Thu Jan  8 11:07:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp: Added #include "ace/ACE.h" for ACE::debug()
          and "ace/OS_NS_string.h" for ACE_OS::strlen().

Thu Jan  8 15:45:50 GMT 2004  Paul Morrison  <epm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_shm.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_msg.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp:
        * ace/Mem_Map.i:

        * ace/SSL/ssl.mpc:
        * ace/TMCast/TMCast.mpc:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:

          Removed the include_dir setting.  This is determined automatically
          in the Borland template.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed support for the include_dir keyword.  It's usage is
          superseded by the use of <%relwd%> in the Borland template.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Use xxx ?= instead of ifndef xxx, for setting default values
          since it is more concise and makes the files much smaller.

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
          Always add the *_UNCHECKED to the regular targets if no
          components are missing, since Makefiles can have both checked
          and unchecked targets.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
          Moved the check for which ld version is used out of and above
          the shared library section so that we could use the GNU_LD flag
          to add "-static" to a new variable, STATIC_LINK_FLAG when using
          the GNU version of ld.  Then add STATIC_LINK_FLAG to LDFLAGS if
          static_libs_only=1.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
          Added CLEANUP_VLIB and use it to set CLEANUP_INSTALL since it
          includes the VAR extention if one was set.  Also, make VLIBS
          dependent on IDL_SRC.

Wed Jan  7 17:34:26 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

          for "ace/OS_NS_*.h".

        * examples/APG/Reactor/Client.h:
        * examples/APG/Reactor/ClientService.h" Add #include
          "ace/Synch_Traits.h", "ace/Null_Condition.h", and "ace/Null_Mutex.h"
          for Visual Age C++ to see when compiling templates.

        * ACEXML/Makefile:
        * examples/APG/Svc_Config/Makefile:
        * examples/APG/Timers/Makefile: Move the rm tempinc up to before
          the sub-make runs to avoid whacking it while a subsequent sub-make
          is running.

        * examples/APG/Svc_Config/Makefile.dynamic: Add LIBS += $(ACELIB)

        * tests/Makefile: Add .NOTPARALLEL for Visual Age C++ to avoid
          squashing tempinc randomly, resulting in missing templates.

        * tests/Makefile.tests: Moved the DIRS_PARALLEL setting down to after
          wrapper_macros.GNU is included and only set it for non-Visual Age C++
          builds. The tempinc directory getting mashed in parallel builds
          makes mysterious build errors happen on AIX, Visual Age C++.

Wed Jan  7 16:33:14 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-tandem-nsk-mips-v2.h:

          Added the config files provided by Gary Maxey <gay.maxey@hp.com>
          for Tandem NSK.

Wed Jan  7 15:55:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.inl (getipnodebyaddr, getipnodebyname, ): Make
          ACE_WIN32 go through the IPv4-only case. Since Windows IPv6
          implementation (at this time) doesn't offer
          getipnodebyname() we make the code to pass through IPV4 portion
          even if ACE_HAS_IPV6 is enabled.

        * ace/OS_NS_arpa_inet.inl (inet_ntop, inet_pton): Make these run
          through the IPv4-only section on Win32 as well. These may be doable
          on Windows using the getnameinfo() function, but it's not clear.
          Needs some research and checking (and improvement of the docs for)
          what the args for ACE_OS::inet_ntop() and inet_pton() are.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:

          The following  checkin "Mon Jan  5 11:02:55 2004  Douglas
          C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>" actually broke
          ACE_Auto_Event. The idea behind the said checkin was to do a
          check whether a proper event occured during event_wait (),
          insted of a spurious wakeup call. This was achieved by checking
          the value of <is_signaled_>. This works great for manual
          events. For auto events, we don't set the variable value if we
          have waiting threads. This makes the threads calling
          Auto_Event.wait () to wait for ever.

          We now have another special boolean variable added to
          ACE_event_t class which keeps track whether an auto event was
          signalled during the signal () call. Thanks to Dr. Schmidt for
          giving this idea. We need to revisit this later after x.4 and
          use inheritance and polymorphism to encapsulate these behvioral
          differences. Doing now could break backward compatibility.

Wed Jan  7 13:03:06 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added an informational message when a project will be skipped when
          a required feature is disabled or an avoided feature is enabled.

Wed Jan  7 18:37:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
          Added special rule to install the os_include directory and its
          subdirectories. Thanks to Chris Kohlhoff for coming up with the
          solution and to Cyrille Chépélov <cyrille@softek.fr> for reporting
          this. This fixes [BUGID 1669].

          Removed the c++ files and added them with cpp again. The BCB makefile
          environment can't handle files with a + in the name. Because we are
          using MPC this test is now also build with Borland.

        * apps/gperf/tests/Makefile:
        * apps/gperf/tests/Makefile.am:
        * apps/gperf/tests/tests.mpc:
          Updated these files to reflect the change above.

          Added an option that causes MPC to apply the name modifier
          (specified by the -name_modifier option) to project names in
          addition to workspace and project file names.

Wed Jan  7 14:04:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Corrected the check whether we need to generate LIBFILES or not.

Wed Jan  7 13:10:01 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Generate the -j option again, thanks for Chris Kohlhoff for pointing
          out the need for it. If there are no staticflags or dynamicflags, just
          generate nothing instead of an empty line. Don't generate the
          INCLUDES anymore because we generate an explicit install target.
          Fixed the install target to handle existing directories and generate
          it at the end of the file.

Wed Jan  7 13:03:49 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Unbounded_Set_Ex.h:

          When usign gnuace generate LDLIBS += $(MATHLIB) at the place of

          Fixed a bug where $() variables used within Source_Files would
          cause an incorrect VPATH to be created in the generated Makefile.
          Also, removed an unused code block.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Reimplemented the create_array() method to fix a bug with escaped
          double and single quotes and to improve performance.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

Tue Jan  6 17:50:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/TLI.cpp (get_option, set_option): For the XPG5 case, use
          a auto_ptr<char> to hold the allocated buff pointer, even though
          it's a void*, to compile correctly. Need to cast this to make
          it work.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU: Change -ltli_r to -lxti
          to use XTI instead of TLI. Also see:
          Mon Dec 29 17:09:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          Removed the versioned_so=0 default - with versioned_so=0, the rule
          for making VLIB gets overridden by the one for VSHLIB: shr.o. Not
          sure how to remedy this, but by making a versioned_so, it's at
          least building it normally.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU: Made with_ld=aix not
          try to set any versioned_so linker options. The default doesn't work,
          and as long as we're linking to archives that contain shr.o, this
          is probably fine. If we ever get rtl mode working, this probably
          needs to be revisited.

          works only on g++ 2.96 and later.

        * examples/APG/Makefile: Re-enabled the Logging directory - with the
          fixes above, this should work everywhere now.

          Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS::strlen().

        * tests/Naming_Test.cpp: Add #include "ace/ACE.h" so Visual Age C++
          can see ACE::basename().

Mon Jan  5 16:34:18 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        Incorporated these fixes from Riverace's ACE 5.3:
        Thu Dec 18 11:07:22 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace_wchar.inl: When converting narrow<->wide on Windows, use
          the current ANSI code page for narrow chars, not CP_OEMCP. This
          allows 8-bit narrow characters to be converted correctly.

        Wed Dec 10 14:22:16 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp: Added a test for wide/narrow character string
          conversions.

Mon Jan  5 14:09:34 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log):
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (to_string): Tandem NSK uses a struct for
          pthread_t.   Need changes to existing preprocessor #ifs in
          Log_Msg.cpp and OS_NS_Thread.cpp to handle this so they now
          read

          #  elif defined (ACE_MVS) || defined (ACE_TANDEM_T1248_PTHREADS)

          Thanks to Gary Maxey for this fix, which fixes bugid 1704.

        * ace/Handle_Set.cpp: The order of bits in the elements of the
          fd_set structure for the Tandem NSK platform is left-to-right rather
          than right-to-left like most other platforms except pSoS.  Therefore
          added

          #  if defined (ACE_PSOS) || defined (ACE_TANDEM_NSK_BIT_ORDER)

          to handle this situation.  Thanks to Gary Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com>
          for reporting this and providing the fix.  This fixes bugid 1703.

Mon Jan  5 12:43:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Name_Proxy.cpp:
        * ace/Time_Request_Reply.cpp:

          #included "ace/os_include/arpa/os_inet.h" to fix [BUG
          1701]. Thanks to Garey Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com> for reporting
          the problem.

Mon Jan  5 12:30:56 2004  Don Hinton <dhinton@ieee.org>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Fixed a bug report that caused the generated cpp files to be
          added to the archive. Thanks to Werner Buchart <w.buchert@medat.de>
          for reporting the problem.

          Removed the .\ that preceded file names to allow users to put
          absolute paths in MPC files (which isn't recommended for
          portability reasons).

Mon Jan  5 11:02:55 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl: Fixed ACE_OS::event_timedwait() and
          ACE_OS::event_wait() so that they use a while loop around the
          ACE_OS::cond_[timed]wait() calls to avoid problems with spurious
          wakeups, etc.  Thanks to John Bossom <John.Bossom@Cognos.COM>
          for motivating this fix.

Sun Jan  4 09:56:04 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/APG/Makefile:

          Removed the Logging example from the builds. The macro
          definitions seem to pain a few compilers.

Sun Jan  4 11:59:46 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          There is no need to pass the libpaths with the -j commandline option
          to the linker, the -L flags is only needed. The -j flag specifies
          where the object files are located, the -L flag the location of the
          lib files.

Sun Jan  4 10:30:06 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/Makefile:

Sun Jan  4 10:18:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/jaws3.mpc:
          Set correct dynamicflags. Instead of using ../ as includes, use ..
          Borland has problems with ../ and in other places we also use ..

Sun Jan  4 08:59:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/Futures.cpp:
        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/ThreadPool.cpp:
          Changed return type of thread_id functions from int to ACE_thread_t

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigInfo.cpp:
          Cygwin doesn't have unix signals, so added #ifdef for the main to
          output an debug message that this example is not supported on this
          platform when no unix signals are available.

        * examples/APG/Proactor/HA_Proactive_Status.{h,cpp}:
          With Cygwin we don't have aio, so added here also a main that
          outputs not supported when this is not available.

Sun Jan  4 08:28:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/Reactor/Timer_Cancel.cpp:

        * examples/APG/Containers/containers.mpc:
          Prefixed the project name Map Manager with the '*' operator to
          avoid project name conflicts. Added Id tag

Sat Jan  3 23:45:38 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/APG/Makefile:

          Some tests/examples do need threads and synchronization. Instead
          of doing tricks and confusing the reader, let us be good on them
          and prevent compilation in single threaded builds.

Sat Jan  3 23:12:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Makefile:

        * examples/APG/ThreadSafety/Barrier.cpp: Get a random sleep time
          using ACE_OS::rand() instead of the thread ID. Thread ID is not
          an integral type on some platforms.

Sat Jan  3 14:08:13 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

Sat Jan  3 11:02:32 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Makefile:

          Removed ASG for the timebeing from the daily builds. I want to
          seperate the chaff from wheat and the noise form this is making
          things hard. Will let Steve know about this.

Sat Jan  3 16:14:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Removed the usage of IDL_DIR. There where problems when generating
          Borland makefiles for projects where the idl file is in a different
          directory than the project file. In that case the IDL_DIR should
          not be . but the directory where the idl files are. Because this is
          a hard thing to do, just removed IDL_DIR and take the path of the
          IDL file that is in the MPC file. This way Borland works just like the
          other environments and this way we can also handle IDL files in
          other directories.

Sat Jan  3 13:11:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Added needed includes to compile the APG examples using the Borland
        compiler.

        * examples/APG/Reactor/HAStatus.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Reactor/HAStatus-AC.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/os_include/os_netdb.h" to get MAXHOSTNAMELEN.

        * examples/APG/Naming/Graphable_Element.h: Corrected include for
          list<> to be <list>, not "list".

        * examples/APG/Naming/Graphable_Element.cpp: Removed this file. It
          only had template instantiations in it, for list<> and friends.
          We're not even going to try this with explicit instantiation.

        * examples/APG/Shared_Memory/Record.h: Changed #include "ace/OS.h"
          to "ace/OS_NS_string.h".

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigAction.cpp: Account for platforms that
          require the signal handler to be extern "C".

        * examples/APG/Makefile: Only build the Naming directory if using
          implicit template instantiation. See above for rationale.

Fri Jan  2 13:00:20 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/APG/Sockets/sockets.mpc:

          Prefixed the project name with the '*' operator to avoid project

          Changed instances of dllflags to dynamicflags and added the '*'
          operator to some of the project names to remove duplicates.

Fri Jan 02 08:08:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Also overrule PASCALDIR and UNICODEDIR

Thu Jan 01 20:25:22 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/TSS_Static_Test.dsp:

          A new project file for TSS_Static_Test.

        * tests/tests.dsw:

          Added the new dsp file into the project.

Thu Jan  1 17:56:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (closesocket): On HP-UX, use
          shutdown() rather than close() to close a socket. shutdown()
          will abort an in-progress operation in another thread, while
          close() won't. This fixes the hang in the
          MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test and will make the Proactor
          stuff more easy to work with as well.

        * ace/Time_Value.h: Don't include <time.h> (or <sys/time.h>) directly;
          use ace/os_include/sys/os_time.h to get what's needed. This
          prevents HP-UX from pulling in <time.h> before <sys/time.h> and
          picking up the wrong declaration for select(). Fixes gcc builds.

        * ace/Name_Space.h: Replace forward declarations of ACE_Unbounded_Set
          with #include "ace/Unbounded_Set.h". Needed to generate template
          specializations.

        * examples/APG/Logging/Callback-2.h:

          Added #includes for "ace/OS_NS_*.h" as needed to convert from
          5.3 OS.h usage to refactored OS_NS_*.h headers. Added missing
          header includes that worked by accident in ACE 5.3.

        * examples/APG/Timers/Upcall.h: Added registration () method that
          is now required for a timer queue upcall functor class. This is
          also new at ACE 5.4.

Thu Jan  1 16:23:17 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/make_release: Add VC6 to files that generate_makefiles() makes.

        * examples/Makefile:
        * examples/APG: Added all examples from "The ACE Programmer's Guide".

        * include/makeinclude/outputdir.bor:

Thu Jan  1 17:59:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
          Removed not needed doxygen close group tag

Thu Jan  1 17:23:44 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added CLEANUP_BIN to the list of objects cleaned up during a
          clean, since they aren't always added to SRC.  They get cleaned
          when you do a realclean since it removes the .obj directory, but
          this allows you to use clean correctly too.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Make sure that all appropriate variables are added to the
          cleanup targets, e.g., we used to test for LIB, then LIB2, then
          LIB_UNCHECKED in that order, but quit testing once we found
          one.  Now, we test them all and add them.  This fixes a bug with
          realclean discovered because MPC defines LIB in terms of
          LIB_UNCHECKED, then sets LIB= if sufficient components weren't
          built, but only after we already set CLEANUP_LIB=$LIB.  Which
          meant we ended up not cleaning anything.  Thanks to Bala for
          noticing the problem and motivating the fix.

Thu Jan  1 16:00:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/asn1.cpp:
          Removed not needed ;. This is the last fix for bugzilla [BUGID 1677]

        * Happy New Year!  Let's hope that 2004 is a safe and prosperous
          year for everyone.

        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.h:
        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.inl:
        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.cpp:

          Added #include "os_include/sys/os_time.h" and
          data member itimerval itimer_ wrapped with ACE_USES_GPROF.

          This data member will hold the thread profiling timer.
          Added Accessor function to itimer_ data member.
          (ACE_Base_Thread_Adapter) Constructor calls getitimer.
          (ace_thread_adapter) Calls setitimer.
          Both are wrapped with ACE_USES_GPROF

        * ace/README:
          Added Useful information about ACE_USES_GPROF macro.
          That macro enable profiling with gprof in a multithreaded
          application.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Optimized the implementation of the -exclude option to correctly
          avoid searching for files located in excluded directories.

Wed Dec 31 07:13:25 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/TMCast/MTQueue.hpp:

          Added #include for ace/os_include/sys/os_types.h to get the
          definition of size_t and changed references to std::size_t to
          size_t.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:

          Added a #pragma waring to disable warning #4800 which is a
          conversion of integer to boolean warning.

Wed Dec 31 06:46:36 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3.mwc:

          Removed this file.  It is not necessary for two reasons.  1) The
          jaws3 project will be part of the "apps" workspace.  2) If a
          workspace with just jaws3 is desired, one could run mwc.pl in the
          apps/JAWS3 directory to obtain the same results as the removed
          mwc file.

Wed Dec 31 12:30:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Tue Dec 30 18:14:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_TLI.inl (t_alloc): For XPG5, the t_alloc() return type
          changed from char* to void*, so using ACE_OSCALL_RETURN doesn't
          work. Use ACE_OSCALL to control the type and return more closely.

Tue Dec 30 15:21:16 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set_interface):

          Check for multicast link local in addition to unicast link local
          before calling a if_nametoindex (). Thanks to Andre Kostur
          <Andre@incognito.com > for providing the patch.

Tue Dec 30 13:02:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added the os_include, os_include/arpa, os_include/net,
          os_include/netinet and os_include/sys directories to the
          Header_Files section.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added code to get allow templates to get the current working
          directory and the directory relative to the current working
          directory with the relative definitions.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:

          Updated the Borland template to put the executables and libraries
          in locations consistent with all other MPC generated projects.

        * include/makeinclude/build_dll.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_example.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_exe.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_lib.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/install.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/outputdir.bor:

          Modified these to work with the new Borland template.  The
          defaults have not been changed and the changes that were made
          should be backward compatible with the existing Borland
          makefiles.

Tue Dec 30 15:16:02 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * *.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/*.mpt:
          Added $ID tag to quash fuzz errors.

Tue Dec 30 08:38:59 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Removed Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.cpp from the Template_Files.
          Apparently there was never a Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.cpp.

Mon Dec 29 17:09:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/TLI.cpp: Add #include "ace/OS_TLI.h" to see the ACE_OS::t_*
          methods and LOCALNAME/REMOTENAME. In get_option() and set_option(),
          decide on use of auto_ptr vs. ACE_Auto_Array_Ptr based on the XPG
          level currently being used. XPG5 changed the buf member from
          char* to void*.

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Removed ACE_HAS_TIUSER_H and ACE_HAS_TLI;
          added ACE_HAS_XTI. Go with the more advanced capabilities.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Set the default value
          for 'inline' based on 'debug' - if debug is on, inline off, and
          vice-versa.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Corrected the "inline ?="
          line to set the default to 1 (instead of blank). This enables
          inlining unless platform_macros.GNU sets it explicitly.

Mon Dec 29 14:48:30 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Do not run reference counted servant test in the minimum corba
          builds.

Mon Dec 29 12:48:22 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Reduced iterations for a few tests.

Mon Dec 29 18:28:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Also remove the final '/' from STRIP_FROM_PATH, i.e.,
          STRIP_FROM_PATH=$(ACE_ROOT)/, so that the file list will look
          like this, ace/<file>, instead of /ace/<file>.

Mon Dec 29 11:20:50 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added Bug_1670_Regression to the daily builds.

Mon Dec 29 10:57:23 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added Bug_1568_Regression to the daily builds.

Mon Dec 29 08:48:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        Committing changes originally made by Trevor Fields
        <fields_t@ociweb.com> on TAO 1.3a.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dsnotifylogadmin.mpb:

          Changed the inheritance to correspond with what the
          DsNotifyLogAdmin library uses.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/openssl.mpb:

          Added $(SSL_ROOT)/out32 to the libpaths to pick up static
          OpenSSL libraries on Windows.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portablegroup.mpb:

          Added inheritance of minimum_corba.

Sun Dec 28 22:36:22 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added Bug_1693_Test to the daily builds.

Sun Dec 28 15:46:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * etc/*.doxygen:
          Removed CGI_NAME, CGI_URL, DOC_URL, DOC_ABSPATH, BIN_ABSPATH and
          EXT_DOC_PATHS from the doxygen config files. These options are no
          longer available because doxygen now uses PHP for search pages
          instead of CGI. The search page is disabled at this moment.

Sun Dec 28 15:09:34 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Changed CASE_SENSE_NAMES=NO in order to fix problems on systems
          without case sensitive file systems; doxygen adds enough of the
          path to make each filename unique.  Enabled SHORT_NAMES to make
          sure names don't grow too long.

          Set FULL_PATH_NAMES=YES and STRIP_FROM_PATH=$(ACE_ROOT) to avoid
          duplicate filenames on the file list page.  If this works out, we
          may change some of the others also.

Sun Dec 28 11:38:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue.h:
          Use doxygen style of comments for deprecated enum members so that
          they appear on the doxygen deprecated page.

Sun Dec 28 10:44:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp:
          On Tru64 getchar() is a macro which expands to fgetc. fgetc exists
          in the global and in the ACE_OS namespace, so on Tru64 use
          ::getchar() which then expands to ::fgetc(). This looks to work on
          the Tru64 box I am testing on.

Sat Dec 27 12:55:45 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.h:
          Added @deprecated to the deprecated methods in this file so that
          they appear on the doxygen deprecated page.

Sat Dec 27 10:32:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          Re-added setting of GCCLIB_DIR for SIMNT which I removed by accident.
          Thanks to Thomas Lockhart <Thomas.Lockhart@jpl.nasa.gov> for
          pointing this out.

Sat Dec 27 10:22:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Also check for Id tag in .GNU files.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_integrity_ghs.GNU:
          Added missing Id tag

Fri Dec 26 17:29:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/ace.m4: Uncommented the AM_CONDITIONAL for BUILD_SSL so
          explicit sets of --with-ssl work.

Fri Dec 26 16:53:18 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/ace.m4: Don't restrict --enable-rtti to Solaris. AIX Visual Age
          C++ needs to be able to turn this on also. Also changed the default
          to yes, believing I saw a need for RTTI in TAO recently.

        * m4/compiler.m4: For AIX Visual Age C++, if rtti is desired, add
          -qrtti to CXXFLAGS.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_mman.h" to see
          ACE_OS::shm_unlink() and ACE_OS::shm_open(), needed when
          ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM is defined.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:

          Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS::gettimeofday(), and "ace/Guard_T.h"
          so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_Guard classes.

        * tests/test_config.h:
        * tests/Signal_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" so

          so Visual Age C++ sees ACE_OS::strcmp() and "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h"
          so Visual Age C++ sees ACE_OS::sprintf().

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Upgradable_RW_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_time.h"
          so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS::gettimeofday() and

          Visual Age C++ sees ACE_OS::strlen().

        * tests/Multicast_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/Min_Max.h" so
          Visual Age C++ can see ACE_MIN and ACE_MAX. Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_sys_time.h" so Visual Age C++ can see
          ACE_OS::gettimeofday() and "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" so it can see

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Timer_Cancellation_Test.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/Reactor.h" so Visual Age C++ sees ACE_Reactor and
          "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h" so Visual Age C++ sees ACE_OS::sleep().

        * tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Test.cpp:

          so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS::strcpy(), strcat(), strlen().

        * tests/Reader_Writer_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/Guard_T.h" and
          "ace/RW_Thread_Mutex.h" so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_Guard and
          ACE_RW_Thread_Mutex classes.

        * tests/Recursive_Condition_Test.cpp: Added #include

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoexe.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taolib_with_idl.mpb:

          We are forcing -Sc to the users. Though this is generally good,
          but it breaks some of the tests in TAO that uses the TIE
          classes.  Just removing -Sc so that we have the minimal number
          of options out here.

Fri Dec 26 18:22:07 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
          Test CLEANUP_BIN, etc., instead of BIN to determine whether or
          not to include rules.bin.GNU, etc.  These file define the
          CLEANUP_INSTALL variables needed to properly do a realclean.
          This is needed because Makefiles might use BIN2 or BIN_UNCHECKED
          instead of BIN, but still need to be cleaned up.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added '*' to end of lib name so that *all* versions of a lib are
          cleaned up, not just the current one.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          No need to test to see if a variable is defined in order to
          define it, just use ?= which only sets a variable if not yet
          defined.

Wed Dec 24 12:35:41 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h:
          Removed ACE_HAS_TLI and ACE_HAS_TLI_PROTOTYPES. Added ACE_HAS_XTI.

Wed Dec 24 09:54:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          Add discussion of conventions to be used to identify shipped
          versions of VxWorks. Allow implicit templates using the
          templates variable. Default continues to be "explicit".
          Clean up some references to obsolete and unsupported versions
          of VxWorks compilers. Use explicit paths to compilers and
          utilities, and remove manipulation of PATH.
          Set the default version of VxWorks to 5.5.1, as shipped with
          Tornado 2.2 on PPC604.
          Removed -traditional from compiler flags, it causes problems
          with VxWorks 5.5.

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          Move VxWorks-specific features to config-vxworks5.x.h.

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Isolate Tornado-2.1 features to a check for ACE_VXWORKS == 0x542.
          This is consistent with the conventions suggested by J. Willemsen
          though VxWorks 5.4.2 also shipped with Tornado 2.0.2. See further
          discussion in platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU.
          Disable ACE_LACKS_AUTO_PTR except for ACE_VXWORKS == 0x542 since
          it is available on Tornado 2.2.x for PPC604 at least. Comments
          indicate that this was a problem on a Hitachi processor for
          Tornado 2.1.

          Thanks to Thomas Lockhart <Thomas.Lockhart@jpl.nasa.gov> for
          providing these patches.

Tue Dec 23 17:55:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Tue Dec 23 16:52:56 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Reordered printing of make rules so that the standard targets
          (all, install, debug, etc.) are emitted into the makefile BEFORE
          the targets for each project.  This insures that 'all' remains
          the first target in the makefile, and is thus the default target
          when make is invoked without a target.

          This should resolve the problem where builds failed due to what
          looked like the IDL compiler not being completely built.

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Impl.h:
          Added export macro, so that the destructor is exported. This fixes

Mon Dec 22 17:46:12 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Don't bother getting a ACE_HAS_TLI_PROTOTYPES
          setting if ACE_HAS_XTI. It's not needed. Fix the check for
          ACE_HAS_CONFLICTING_XTI_MACROS to only include xti.h, not tliuser.h,
          since that's where the errors are. The XTI and TLI parts are now
          separate; if the platform has XTI, none of the TLI checks are done.
          Made the check for sigaction()'s second argument set (or not)
          new config setting, ACE_HAS_SIGACTION_CONSTP2. See below.

        * m4/config_h.m4: Removed entries for ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES and
          ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES. Renamed ACE_HAS_BROKEN_XTI_MACROS
          to ACE_HAS_CONFLICTING_XTI_MACROS. Added entries for
          ACE_HAS_SIGACTION_CONSTP2. See rationale in ace/README entry, below.

        * ace/README: Clarified the meanings of ACE_HAS_TLI, ACE_HAS_XTI,
          and ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI. Changed entry for ACE_HAS_BROKEN_XTI_MACROS to
          ACE_HAS_CONFLICTING_XTI_MACROS and explained it more (both names were
          used previously). Removed entries for ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES
          and ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES. These ended up a catch-all for
          platforms that had odd, or non-conforming (these days anyway) APIs
          for some SysV, signal, or stdio functions. Any reference to
          ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOYPES is now gone. If it causes any problems
          (very doubtful since the only configs that used it were
          SunOS 4) it can be added back in a more explanatory fashion.
          Uses of ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES are replaced by
          more specific settings that autoconf is detecting now anyway.
          These are:
             ACE_HAS_SIGACTION_CONSTP2: sigaction() 2nd parameter is
             const sigaction*, as opposed to non-const.

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Removed #define ACE_HAS_BROKEN_XTI_MACROS.
          This is not sued any longer (see README above).

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
        * ace/config-integritySCA.h:
        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h: Removed entry for
          ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES. Applies only for glibc earlier than
          2.2. If this breaks something, send details to me.

        * ace/config-rtems.h: Removed ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES and
          ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES; added ACE_HAS_SIGACTION_CONSTP2.

        * ace/config-sco-5.0.0.h:
        * ace/config-sco-5.0.0-mit-pthread.h:
        * ace/config-tandem.h: Removed entry for ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES
          (was commented out anyway).

        * ace/config-sunos4-sun3.x.h:
        * ace/config-sunos4-sun4.1.4.h:
        * ace/config-sunos4-sun4.x.h: Removed entry for
          ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES. If this breaks a build, please email
          shuston@riverace.com with compile errors and PRF.

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl: Removed #include "ace/OS.h"; replaced with
          #include "ace/OS_NS_fcntl.h" and "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h".
          (dlsym): Removed the #if defined (ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES) - this
          is not needed.

        * ace/OS_NS_signal.inl (sigaction): const_cast the new sigaction arg
          if ACE_HAS_SIGACTION_CONSTP2 is not defined. This takes the place
          of either ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES or
          ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES.

        * ace/OS_TLI.h: Rearranged the places and situations that TLI or XTI
          headers are included. These were confused over the years as platforms
          were ported to, and the TLI API evolved to XTI. The way this now
          works mirrors the way modern platforms work. XTI is the newer and
          current API. If XTI is available, ACE_HAS_XTI should be set. If
          XTI is not available, but the older TLI is, ACE_HAS_TLI should be
          set. ACE_HAS_XTI takes precedence if they're both set. If only TLI
          is available, the correct header (tiuser.h) is included if
          ACE_HAS_TIUSER_H is set. tiuser.h is a compatibility carryover for
          platforms with XTI. If the platform has TLI, not XTI, and no
          tiuser.h, this file doesn't include any system headers - this may
          be wrong, but I don't have any platforms available to try.
          Also, ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI applies to platforms with TLI (not XTI) and
          additional, pre-XTI functionality such as t_getname(). This is
          true for older SunOS, but I don't think any modern platforms
          should set this. XTI includes all the things that distinguish
          ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI from TLI, so if ACE_HAS_XTI is set, ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI
          is ignored. To summarize, the order of precedence is, XTI, then
          TLI, optionally modified by ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI.

        * ace/OS_TLI.inl (t_getname): Add code for calling t_getprotaddr()
          if ACE_HAS_XTI. It would be good to add ACE_OS::t_getprotaddr()
          since most platforms support XTI these days. But this will do
          for now.

        * ace/TLI.cpp (get_local_addr): Forward this through to
          ACE_OS::t_getname(), which can now handle both ACE_HAS_XTI and
          ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI.
          (set_option, get_option): Added the XTI code for these.

        * ace/TLI_Connector.cpp (complete):
        * ace/TLI_Stream.cpp (get_remote_addr): Regardless of which flavor of
          XTI/TLI is set, call ACE_OS::t_getname() to get the address info.
          It now can do both XTI and TLI.

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h: Removed the #defines for LOCALNAME and
          REMOTENAME. These are now in ace/OS_TLI.h where they come from.

        * ace/config-lite.h: Add a check after including config.h for
          ACE_HAS_XTI. XTI is what TLI evolved to, and wherever ACE
          wants to provide a TLI function or not, it checks for ACE_HAS_TLI.
          Since ACE_HAS_XTI can be set without ACE_HAS_TLI, we set ACE_HAS_TLI
          to get the basic functionality-providing checks taken care of.

        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.h:
        * tests/Message_Queue_Notifications_Test.cpp:
        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.h:
        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Svc_Handler_Test.cpp:
          Fixed fuzz errors by removing unneeded #include of Synch.h.

Mon Dec 22 10:31:41 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added information about disallowing duplicate projects within a
          single workspace regardless of the project type.  It is no longer
          specific to the VC6 type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the workspace output to allow a user to make a specific
          target within the workspace.  If the user specified target
          requires other projects, then those projects are built also.  For
          example, a user could execute "make CosNaming" using the Makefile
          generated from the TAOACE.mwc file and the CosNaming library
          would be built including everything else that was required to
          build that library.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the output section of the code to only compare the
          existing output file to the newly created output file only if
          required by the individual project or workspace type.  Currently
          only VC6, EM3 (through inheritance), VC7 and VC71 (through
          inheritance) use this.

Sun Dec 21 08:40:46 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Synch_Lib/Benchmark_Base.cpp:

          Fixed an annoying warning about redefinition.

Sun Dec 21 13:55:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Test_Output.dsp:
          Cleared the output directory for the static configurations, all
          test project expect the lib to be in the same directory.

Sun Dec 21 10:16:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * *.bor:
          Added missing Id tag to all Borland makefiles which didn't have it
          yet.

Sun Dec 21 10:02:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Timeprobe.h:
          Added missing includes when ACE_COMPILE_TIMEPROBES is set to 1.
          Thanks to Konstantinos Margaritis <markos@debian.gr> for reporting
          this.

Sun Dec 21 09:45:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Kokyu/Makefile.bor:
        * Kokyu/Makefile.Kokyu.bor:
          Added Id tag to fix fuzz errors

Sat Dec 20 17:51:49 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserContext.inl:
          Removed not needed ; to fix a Tru64 warning

Sat Dec 20 14:21:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACEXML/*.bor:
          Added missing Id tag to fix fuzz errors

Sat Dec 20 13:22:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Changed filters to the types of files a little so that a Makefile.bor is
          handled as a Borland makefile.

Fri Dec 19 22:56:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/RMCast/RMCast.h:
        * ace/RMCast/RMCast_IO_UDP.cpp:
        * ace/RMCast/RMCast_UDP_Proxy.cpp:

          Enums are evil, more so with broken compilers that cannot scope
          enums within a class. LynxOS defines a bunch of #defines with
          MT_* which starts colliding with the MT_* declaration in the
          above files. Renamed the enums to be RMCAST_MT_*. Thanks to
          Thomas Lockhart <Thomas.Lockhart@jpl.nasa.gov> for providing
          patches to fix this.

Fri Dec 19 22:34:42 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.i:

          Fix for [BUGID 1688]. Please see

          http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1688

          for more details. Thanks to Gary Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com> for
          the patch.

Fri Dec 19 11:57:20 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Sigset_Ops_Test.cpp: Add an optional can_miss parameter to
          the siglistset() function; defaults to 0 (current behavior). Pass
          it as 1 when the full (sigfillset) set is being tested because
          there's no guarantee that all signals from 1-ACE_NSIG are legit
          and set in the sigset. This is true on Red Hat Linux w/ NPTL
          (Redhat 9 and Enterprise Linux 3, for example). Thanks to
          Roger Beathard (rbeathar@cisco.com) for reporting this issue.

        * tests/Makefile.tests: Added TSS_Static_Test.

Fri Dec 19 08:43:44 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp: Reformatted some of the code to conform to
          ACE guidelines.  In particular, stuff like this:

          if ((this->lock_ = ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T<ACE_LOCK> ()(pool_name)) == 0)
            return;

          should be written like this:

          this->lock_ = ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T<ACE_LOCK> ()(pool_name);
          if (this->lock_ == 0)
            return;

          since the latter is less error prone and more readable!

Fri Dec 19 13:31:59 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.i (isChar):
          Made the argument non const, just as the method declaration
          in the header file. This fixes a compile error on Tru64.

Fri Dec 19 13:29:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/C++NPv2/C++NPv2.mpc:
          Use the new wfmo base project.

Fri Dec 19 13:27:54 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp:
          Removed not needed ; after extern C to fix a Tru64 warning

Fri Dec 19 07:19:37 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a workspace/project name modifier (-name_modifier) which can
          be used to modify workspace and project names using a pattern
          replacement.  The parameter passed to -name_modifier will have any
          instances of the asterisk character replaced with the actual
          workspace or project name.

          Also, deprecated the -static_only option and modified -static to
          generate only static projects (since dynamic and static couldn't
          co-exist with the vc6 and vc7 types).

          And, finally, replaced $generator with $creator which is more
          consistent with object names.

Fri Dec 19 11:45:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-osf1-3.2.h:
        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h:
          Replaced ACE_HAS_64BIT_LONGS with ACE_SIZEOF_LONG 8 to fix compile
          errors on Tru64.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/wfmo.mpb:
          Added new config file. Projects that need wfmo, should be based on
          this.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          When wfmo is not set, we set it to 0. So by default all platforms that
          use the GNU makefiles lack wfmo support.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
          MinGW has wfmo, so set wfmo to 1.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/WFMO_Reactor.mpc:
          Based now on the wfmo instead of a GNU specific hack. This simplifies
          this MPC file but also with MinGW we will now build these examples.

Fri Dec 19 10:46:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Codeset_Registry.cpp:
          Removed not needed ; after ACE_RCSID to fix Tru64 warning.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS_TLI.h:
        * ace/UUID.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * ace/OS_NS_arpa_inet.h:
          Removed not needed ; after namespace close } to fix Tru64 warning.

        * ace/config-cxx-common.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION. I hope all
          version of the Compaq CC compiler will support this, V6.5 needs this

        * ace/config-tru64.h:
          Tru64 5.1 doesn't have stdint.h so added ACE_LACKS_STDINT_H. I don't
          know of previous versions, so made this dependent on the version of
          Tru64.

        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h:
          Moved check for ACE_MT_SAFE for ACE_LACKS_CLEARERR a little bit down,
          so that ACE_MT_SAFE is always defined to fix compile error on Tru64.

        * tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:
          Make sure we don't have local variables with the same name but
          different type to fix Tru64 warning.

Fri Dec 19 03:29:33 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/System_V_IPC/SV_Semaphores/Semaphores_1.cpp:
        * examples/System_V_IPC/SV_Semaphores/Semaphores_2.cpp:
        * tests/SV_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp:
          More explicit template instantiations of
          ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T.

Fri Dec 19 01:27:00 UTC 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Abandoned.cpp (handle_timeout):

          Must remove handler from the Reactor before the handler dies.
          Otherwise, a call back from the Reactor will result in a seg
          fault.

Fri Dec 19 01:26:00 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/RW_Process_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Mutex.cpp:
          Added #include ace/Malloc_T.h.

Fri Dec 19 00:46:23 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Null_Mutex.h:
          Added template specialization of ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T.

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/RW_Process_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Mutex.cpp:
          Added explicit template instantiations for
          ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter.

Thu Dec 18 22:43:09 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Malloc_T.{h,cpp}:
          Added a new functor template class, ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T, used
          by ACE_Malloc_T as a factory for the ACE_LOCK template parameter,
          and allows the use of locking strategy classes that don't have a
          satisfactory ctor taking a single required ACE_TCHAR* parameter,
          which is the default.  Thanks to John Glynn <jglynn@bjc.org> for
          motivating this.

        * ace/Process_Semaphore.{h,cpp}:
        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.{h,cpp}:
          Added template specializations of ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T for
          ACE_Process_Semaphore and ACE_Thread_Semaphore since they don't
          have a satisfactory ctor taking an ACT_TCHAR*.  Thanks to John
          Glynn <jglynn@bjc.org> for motivating this.

Thu Dec 18 11:55:29 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Null_Barrier.h:
        * ace/Null_Condition.h:
        * ace/Null_Mutex.h:
        * ace/Null_Semaphore.h:

          All methods in both of these files are inline and therefor do not
          need ACE_Export.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Updated the Inline_Files and Header_Files sections.

        * examples/TMCast/Member/member.cpp:

          Added #include of OS_NS_string.h to get ACE_OS::strlen and added a
          return value for main.

Thu Dec 18 09:53:31 2003  Balachandran  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE version 5.3.6 released.

Thu Dec 18 08:45:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/make_release:

          Generate vc71 for the ace alone. We used to generate vc7 project
          files. But now we generate vc71. Theoretically we shouldn't need
          to generate this. But this is not the time to argue with Steve H
          ;)! Will do after the beta goes out!

Wed Dec 17 12:54:18 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/Group.cpp:
        * ace/TMCast/LinkListener.hpp:

          More fixes for VC 71. Thanks to Chad Elliott for helping
          me checking the results.

Wed Dec 17 09:52:18 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/LinkListener.hpp:

          Fixed errors in VC71 builds.

Wed Dec 17 15:21:36 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * performance_tests/Misc/Makefile:
          Remove static_libs_only=0 and add static_libs=1 and
          shared_libs=0 to insure that only static libs are built.  We
          need to set these values individually instead of setting
          static_libs_only, since users may override it in
          platform_macros.GNU.  Thanks to John Zorko <jmzorko@mac.com> for
          tracking this down and supplying the patch.  This fixed the
          MacOSX compile errors on the scoreboard.

Wed Dec 17 11:25:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TMCast/Group.cpp:
          Fixed compile errors in the SunOS Forte8 build caused by the
          lack of the scope of the exceptions.

Wed Dec 17 11:16:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TMCast/TMCast.mpc:
          TMCast uses native exceptions, so added requires += exceptions
          to this mpc file. This fixes compile errors in no exception
          builds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/tmcast.mpb:
          Because TMCast uses native exceptions, this is also required for
          everything that uses TMCast.

Tue Dec 16 11:48:11 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h:
        * ace/config-aix5.1.h:

          Updated the AIX config files to reflect the existence of
          netinet/tcp.h on AIX 5.1.

Tue Dec 16 09:31:18 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.{h,cpp}:
        * ace/Process_Semaphore.{h,cpp}: Reverted the change
          Sun Dec 14 15:26:46 2003 Douglas C. Schmidt
          <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu> since this has too many side-effects
          that'll break user code.  The "Right Thing"[TM] here is simply
          to update the ACE_Malloc<> documentation to explain not to use
          the ACE_Process_Semaphore or ACE_Thread_Semaphore, but instead
          to use the ACE_Process_Mutex or ACE_Thread_Mutex.  Thanks to
          Don Hinton and Bala for motivating this change.

Tue Dec 16 08:29:05 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed the install targets when installing to the current
          directory.

Tue Dec 16 07:13:53 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/TMCast/TMCast.mpc:
        * ace/ace.mwc:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/tmcast.mpb:

          Added a project and base project for TMCast.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server-simple.cpp:
        * examples/TMCast/Member/member.cpp:

          Added #include's to get things to build on Linux.

        * examples/TMCast/Member/Member.mpc:

          Added an mpc to override the default project to add the tmcast
          base project.

Mon Dec 15 18:51:15 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Added setting of CLEANUP_INSTALL, this has the result that an exe
          that is installed into a different directory is also removed when
          doing a clean. Thanks to Don and Chad for validating this.

Mon Dec 15 11:09:45 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp (ACE_MT_SYNCH>):
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp (ACE_POSIX_CB_Proactor): Added a
          cast to (unsigned int) so things will work properly for the
          ACE_Thread_Semaphore.  Thanks to Bala and Don Hinton for
          reporting these problems.

Mon Dec 15 10:11:31 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.h:
        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp:

          Moved the template class Svc_Handler into a header file so that
          Visual Age C++ could implicitly instantiate the template.

        * tests/Message_Queue_Notifications_Test.cpp:

          Added various #include's to get the tests to build on AIX with
          Visual Age C++ 5.0.

Mon Dec 15 10:06:17 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp (gets): Reverted this change:
          Thu Dec 11 18:13:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          It broke the Borland build and wasn't a very good fix for the
          AIX situation either. Since Riverace is dropping AIX 4.3 support
          at ACE 5.4, I'm not going to push this issue. It appears to be a
          compiler issue with Visual Age C++ version 5.

Mon Dec 15 07:29:27 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Removed a redundant rule to create the $(TEMPINCDIR) directory.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Added -p to the mkdir command in the rules to make the
          $(CLEANUP_DIRS).

Mon Dec 15 11:35:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:
          When ACE_HAS_TRACE is defined include ace/OS_NS_strings.h to get
          ACE_OS::strcasecmp. This fixes a compile error when ACE_NTRACE has
          been defined to 0

Sun Dec 14 15:26:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.{h,cpp}: Added support for an ACE_Thread_Semaphore
          that takes a first param that's an ACE_TCHAR * so that things
          will work properly if ACE_Thread_Semaphore is used with
          ACE_Malloc<>.  Thanks to John Glynn <jglynn@bjc.org> for
          motivating this.

        * ace/Process_Semaphore.{h,cpp}: Added support for an ACE_Process_Semaphore
          that takes a first param that's an ACE_TCHAR * so that things
          will work properly if ACE_Process_Semaphore is used with
          ACE_Malloc<>.  Thanks to John Glynn <jglynn@bjc.org> for
          motivating this.

Sat Dec 13 23:29:05 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Many of the tests were being run in the single threaded
          configuration, though they shouldn't have been.

Fri Dec 12 19:31:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Some tests were run twice. They have been removed.

Fri Dec 12 08:53:50 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyWriter.pm:

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/ObjectGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:
        * bin/depgen.pl:

          More optimizations to decrease dependency generation times.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where when replacing paths (using the -A option), it
          wouldn't replace as much of the path as it could depending on the
          replacement values.  Now they are sorted by length so that the
          longest values are checked first.

Fri Dec 12 08:37:45 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          When creating a build on Windows and we run into a problem with
          linking to a target that has a path that is "too long", we resort
          to the short file name and everyone's happy.

Thu Dec 11 18:25:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Future.cpp: Added #include "ace/Guard_T.h" and
          "ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h" if ACE_HAS_THREADS is defined.
          There are ACE_Guards that use it and AIX Visual Age C++ needs
          to see these headers to work right.

        * ace/Future_Set.h: Added #include "ace/Null_Mutex.h" since this
          file references it in an ACE_Hash_Map_Manager declaration. Even if
          it may have been available during compile, Visual Age C++ needs to
          see the header during link time as well, and it only remembers to
          look at headers that were explicitly included.

Thu Dec 11 18:13:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.inl: Changed use of naked ::memset() calls to
          ACE_OS::memset(). Fixes compile errors on AIX 4.3.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp (gets): Added "ACE_STD_NAMESPACE::" prefix to
          getchar() call; fixes compile error on AIX 4.3.

Wed Dec 10 18:20:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue.h:
          Mark deprecated enums with @deprecated so that they appear on the
          doxygen deprecated page

        * ace/Thread.h:
          Moved comment above method instead of between augments.

Wed Dec 10 13:16:03 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/UUID.cpp (to_string):

          Fixed incorrect delete() operator call.  Use vector delete[]()
          instead of scalar delete() since array was allocated with
          new[]().

Wed Dec 10 15:09:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/TMCast/Member/member.cpp:
          Added missing includes

Wed Dec 10 13:39:53 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          In case of ACE_Log_Msg::SYSLOG is set, log messages to the backend
          and in case of closing down redirect logging to stderr

Wed Dec 10 07:18:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Fixed a bug introduced by my change on Tue Dec  9 13:00:30 2003.

Wed Dec 10 13:17:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server-poll.cpp:
          Added #include of ace/OS_NS_poll.h to get poll() stuff.

Wed Dec 10 07:09:10 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dseventlogadmin.mpb:

          The dseventlogadmin base project should also inherit from event.

Wed Dec 10 12:56:47 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server-fancy.cpp:
          Added #include of OS_NS_sys_select.h to get ACE_OS::select

Wed Dec 10 12:50:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-client.h:
          Fixed casing of include

Wed Dec 10 10:20:48 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/NT_Service.cpp (wait_for_service_state):
          Initialize last_state and last_check_point with 0 to fix MinGW
          compiler warnings.

Wed Dec 10  9:31:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Task_Ex_T.h:
          Removed the ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_EXPORT directive.
          It is meaningless to define it with ACE_MESSAGE_TYPE. Thanks to
          Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi-co@barak-online.net> for reporting this.

Wed Dec 10  9:18:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/TTCP/ACE-C++/TTCP_ACE_C++.mpc:
          Removed this file from the repo. This performance-tests contains
          so many non-portable code that it is impossible to build it on
          all the platforms we have.

Wed Dec 10  8:39:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Tests.bor:
          Added TSS_Static_Test

Tue Dec  9 17:49:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACEXML/apps/svcconf/Svcconf_Handler.cpp:
          Added #include of ace/OS_NS_strings.h to get ACE_OS::strcasecmp

Tue Dec  9 16:33:43 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:
          Removed ACELIB from LIBS since both LIBS and ACELIB is added to
          VLDLIBS in wrapper_macros.GNU.  Otherwise -lACE appears twice in
          the link command.

Tue Dec  9 15:51:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          When ACE_Log_Msg::LOGGER or ACE_Log_Msg::SYSLOG is passed as
          flags, make sure the correct bit is set in flags_. This fixes
          the problem reported by A. Kleibeuker
          <kleibeuk@natlab.research.philips.com> that CORBA::ORB_init()
          fails after ACE_Log_Msg::SYSLOG is passed to the
          ACE_Log_Msg->open() call.

Tue Dec  9 09:28:49 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:

          Removed some unnecessary module usage.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUDependencyWriter.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/NMakeDependencyWriter.pm:

          Avoid copying the array of object files for a speed increase.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Fixed a bug where #if's inside of c comments would be counted.
          Fixed a bug where the Preprocessor would not return an array
          reference if the last file to be processed did not exist.

Tue Dec  9 09:23:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Worked around a bug in the VxWorks OS loader that caused complex
          objects to be constructed multiple times.  Instead of having a
          static ACE_TSS_Keys object within the ACE_TSS_Emulation class, we
          have a static pointer that is allocated upon the first call of
          ACE_TSS_Emulation::next_key().

          Added #includes necessary for building on VxWorks.

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h:

          Changed NSIG to ACE_NSIG.

        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h:

          Added #include <hostLib.h> for gethostname().

        * tests/TSS_Static_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Added a test to ensure that TSS used during static construction
          functions properly.  This test only performs a test if TSS
          emulation is used.

Tue Dec  9 15:09:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        Thanks to Bruce Jones <bruce.jones@cubic.com> for the
        following patches for IRIX.

        * ace/config-irix6.5.x-sgic++.h:
          Removed ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION and
          added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION.

        * ace/config-irix6.x-common.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_PERFECT_MULTICAST_FILTERING.

        * ace/config-irix6.x-sgic++-nothreads.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_STDINT_H.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_irix6.x_sgic++.GNU:
          Set templates = implicit in not yet defined and only add
          -no_prelink to CCFLAGS if templates != implicit.

Mon Dec  8 19:44:04 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.nested.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Make sure that all variables are defined prior to first use to
          get rid of warnings.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Moved the initial assignment of SOVERSION and SONAME from
          wrapper_macros.GNU to rules.lib.GNU so that users can set them
          in a Makefile or in another file, e.g., rules.tao.GNU.
          Since it must be set prior to it's use in rules.lib.GNU--it's
          used in a target name that isn't a pattern, so it's evaluated
          when the file is read--it can't be set later.  If versioned_so=1
          and the user has not set a value, either in the Makefile or by
          including a file like rules.tao.GNU that defines it, the default
          ACE version number will be used.  Note that rules.tao.GNU now
          behaves like rules.lib.GNU and only sets SOVERSION and SONAME
          if versioned_so=1 and they have not yet been set.  Thanks to
          Milan Cvetkovic <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> for motivating this
          change.

Mon Dec  8 07:38:52 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp (fini): Check whether there's a reactor
          configured before trying to access it!  Thanks to Yoav Borer
          <yoav.borer@data-pod.com> for reporting this.

Mon Dec  8 16:14:01 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added a noncvs file check. I found yesterday some ncb and opt files
          in the TAO part of the repo, and they shouldn't be in the repo. This
          are msvc6 generated files. So added a noncvs file check which checks
          whether these files exists, and if they exist, give an error. If
          people know of more extensions that shouldn't get into the repo,
          feel free to add them.

Mon Dec  8 16:06:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Added the ability to better determine whether apps/drwho must be build.
        By setting rwho=0 into the default.features file that MPC uses no
        makefiles are generated. For GNU make, just put rwho=0 into your
        own platform_macros.GNU file or in the specific platform file.

        * apps/drwho/drwho.mpc:
          Added requires rwho and removed the usage of nobuild.

        * apps/drwho/nobuild.mpb:
          Removed this file from the repo, it is not needed anymore

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          When rwho is not set, set it to 1. This way, we can set in the specific
          .GNU files rwho=0 when that environment doesn't support rwho.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_chorus.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_chorus4.x_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_chorus_ghs.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_diab.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_ghs.GNU:
          Added rwho=0 because these environments don't have rwho.

Mon Dec  8 09:14:39 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Remove trailing slashes and duplicate slashes from relative paths.

Sun Dec  7 20:23:34 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          Fixed a problem with this checkin "Fri Nov 21 07:24:07 UTC 2003
          Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>". The config_list
          declaration should be within the loop, else the list will be
          permanent. This lead to our ACE tests being run thrice, TAO ORB
          tests twice and other tests once. That change was bogus. All
          that was required was to remove ":" in the optlist.  Finding
          this out only took 3 hours after getting mislead to search
          through all the perl scripts for autobuild :(!

Sat Dec  6 19:36:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Added #include "ace/Time_Value.h"
          in the ACE_HAS_WINCE section because the WinCE version of struct
          stat uses ACE_Time_Value for time fields.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h: Added ACE_LACKS_FCNTL_H. eVC doesn't supply this,
          at least thru version 4.1.

        * ace/iosfwd.h: Disable most of this file if ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_TOTALLY
          is set.

        * ace/QtReactor.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h: Added /**/ to #include statements to
          keep eVC from complaining about files not being there.

Sat Dec  6 19:27:26 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/aix_hack_for_main.cpp: New file that is here to be
          compiled first, along with Main.cpp, before any real test.
          This simply gets Main.o ready for all the other tests.
          This gets things back to where each test need only compile
          one source file, and the AIX C++ hack to delete the tempinc
          directory works again.

        * tests/Makefile.tests: Add aix_hack_for_main to the front of the
          BIN set of tests. It must be first in order for this hack to work.

Sat Dec  6 09:28:17 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          A bunch of tests depend on dynamic libraries being
          available. They have been prevented from running in the static
          builds. I am sending a separate mail to the authors to fix
          this.

Sat Dec  6 12:55:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/APC.dsp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/APCTest.dsp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/WFMO_Reactor.dsw:
          The APC.dsp file was a normal test file, but it should be a
          binary file, to prevent all kinds of problems by adding and
          removing a file with the same name, just removed APC.dsp and
          added APCTest.dsp as binary. Also updated the corresponding dsw
          file. This should fix an error in the msvc6 debug build when
          cygwin cvs is used.

Fri Dec  5 21:48:43 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CORBA_macros.h:
          Fixed a typo in the documentation. Thanks to Thomas Lockhart for
          pointing it out.

Fri Dec  5 10:20:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/TTCP/ACE-C++/wrapper-new-ttcp.cpp:
          Removed not used local variable

Fri Dec  5 07:28:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Vector_Test.cpp:
          Added explicit template instantiation for the ACE_Vector_Iterator

Thu Dec  4 17:13:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Removed extraneous set of [] for AS_IF test
          ace_has_tli_funcs = yes. Allows complete testing for all TLI/XTI-
          related features. Fixes some HP-UX problems.
          Wrapped ACE_HAS_BROKEN_T_ERROR check in
          ACE_CONVERT_WARNINGS_TO_ERRORS to work right on HP-UX.

        * m4/compiler.m4: Added a conditional set around CFLAGS on HP-UX,
          trying to silence a sh diagnostic at configure time. Didn't work...
          Added +p to WERROR for HP aC++. Allows "future error" warnings
          to be noted as errors. Now can properly detect non-const 5th
          arg to select().

        * m4/tls.m4: Moved AM_CONDITIONAL(BUILD_SSL) outside of the test
          $ac_cv_openssl_libs. This makes sure BUILD_SSL gets set properly
          whether or not with-ssl is set.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (rwlock_init): Added
          !defined (ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT) to the cases where the .cpp
          version of rwlock_init() is defined (as opposed to the version in
          OS_NS_Thread.inl). This matches an earlier change to OS_NS_Thread.h:

Thu Dec  4 13:56:50 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.cpp:

          Added #includes needed to compile if ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T is
          defined.

Thu Dec  4 13:46:36 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Added optimizations that cut the dependency generation time by
          over 40%.

Thu Dec  4 18:34:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bug_1576_Regression_Test.cpp:
          This tests whether loading a non-existent .so will really fail.
          Don't log dll.error() because this is the error that we could
          not load the .so and this will then result in an error on the
          scoreboard. Just log an error in case we are able to load the
          non-existent .so

Thu Dec  4 16:51:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          VxWorks 5.5 (0x550) has clearerr, so changed the defines that
          set ACE_LACKS_CLEARERR to == 0x542 instead of >= 0x542. Thanks
          to Thomas Lockhart <Thomas.Lockhart@jpl.nasa.gov> for reporting
          this.

Thu Dec  4 16:31:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Vector_Test.cpp:
          When using BCB6 or earlier the second template argument of the
          ACE_Vector template must be passed explicit. Just expecting
          that the default one is used doesn't work with Borland.

Thu Dec  4 14:30:44 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi  <kcarazi@finjan.com>

        * ace/Task_Ex_T.i (reply, put_next):
        These 2 functions related to ACE_Stream Framework,
        doesn't work with new ACE_Task_Ex (yet)

Wed Dec  3 23:37:59 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi  <kobi-co@barak-online.net>

        * ace/Task_Ex_T.h:
        Add remark about the idea of merging ACE_Task and ACE_Task_Ex.
        Add remark about sibling always returning 0

        * ace/Task_Ex_T.cpp (ACE_Task_Ex::sibling):
        ACE_Task_Ex::sibling cannot call mod_->sibling(this) because it
        is not typed as ACE_Task<>. Return 0 always when calling sibling.
        TODO: That can be fixed if ACE_Task and ACE_Task_Ex can be merged so
        ACE_Task_Ex can have the Module ability - aka the Stream model.
        See ACE_Task_Ex.h for more info on that.

Wed Dec  3 12:14:51 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        Pulled in these changes from the 5.3 stream:

        Tue Dec  2 14:43:28 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Vector_T.{h cpp i}: Added operator== and operator!= methods
          that take the correct vector length into account. The inherited
          ACE_Array methods run the whole array max length.

        Thu Sep 04 12:20:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Vector_T.{h, i, cpp}: Added new ACE_Vector_Iterator<T> class
          to correctly detect end of the vector content. Use this new class as
          ACE_Vector<>::Iterator. ACE_Vector previously used ACE_Array_Iterator
          as the iterator, but it doesn't notice the end of the legit vector
          area.

        * tests/Vector_Test.cpp: Added a test of the ACE_Vector::Iterator
          range to be sure it gets all legit vector elements, and no more.
          Thanks to Yann Steff <Yann.Steff@jci.com> for this test addition
          and for diagnosing the failure cause.

Wed Dec  3 09:48:55 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in the generated GNU Makefile where idl files that had
          scoped idlflag assignments would be processed every time
          regardless of whether the generated files were up-to-date or not.

Wed Dec  3 11:06:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
          Changed definition thr_setprio to fix link errors in MSVC6 release
          build.

Wed Dec  3 11:39:45 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi  <kcarazi@finjan.com>

        * tests/Task_Ex_Test.cpp:
          Added explicit instantiations to ACE_Task_Ex and ACE_Message_Queue_Ex

Tue Dec  2 16:33:14 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h: Add #include "ace/Object_Manager_Base.h" to get
          the ACE_OS_Object_Manager definition referenced by the ACE_OS_GUARD
          macros.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl: (ACE_OS_Thread_Mutex_Guard,
          ACE_OS_Recursive_Thread_Mutex_Guard): Changed use of
          ACE_Object_Manager::starting_up to ACE_OS_Object_Manager to match
          the class preallocated locks are obtained in the ACE_OS_GUARD
          macros, above. Fixes compile errors on Linux and others.

Tue Dec  2 14:43:17 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.{h inl} (ACE_OS_Thread_Mutex_Guard,
          ACE_OS_Recursive_Thread_Mutex_Guard): Changed the constructors to
          check ACE_Object_Manager::starting_up () before grabbing the
          monitor lock. If done before ACE_Object_Manager has been
          initialized, the lock reference is invalid and often results
          in a crash in the guard object.
          The motivating case for this fix is a static ACE_Date_Time
          object which resulted in an ACE_OS_GUARD crashing in
          ACE_OS::localtime_r(). Thanks to Craig L. Ching
          <cching@mqsoftware.com> for this report.

        * tests/Date_Time_Test.cpp: Test a static ACE_Date_Time object.

Tue Dec  2 16:19:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.h:
          Moved Printer definition outside the ACE_HAS_THREADS check to
          fix compile problems in single threaded builds.

Tue Dec  2 12:15:18 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/C++NPv2/Server_Shutdown.cpp:
          Added include of ace/OS_NS_string.h to get ACE_OS::strcmp

Tue Dec  2 12:07:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Cache_Manager_T.cpp:
          Removed all std::, this causes problems in our MSVC6 builds

Mon Dec  1 22:04:37 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi  <kobi-co@barak-online.net>

        * tests/Task_Ex_Test.cpp:
        Move User_Defined_Msg class to Task_Ex_Test.h.

        * tests/Task_Ex_Test.dsp:
        Add Task_Ex_Test.h to dsp.

        * tests/Task_Ex_Test.h:
        Added to fix problems with AIX IBM and Template instantiations.

Mon Dec  1 13:03:50 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed a bug in the subtraction operator on strings.  Values in
          doubled quoted strings weren't being subtracted properly.

Mon Dec 01 16:01:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm (add_file_written):
          There was a warning given when something was written with exactly the
          same name, added an extra warning when things are just different by
          casing. This is no problem on a Unix box, but on a Windows box it
          will result in the fact that the second file overwrites the first.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Do the duplicate check case insensitive by making everything lower
          case. Thanks to Chris Cleeland <cleeland@ociweb.com> for helping
          me fixing this. The reason is that VC6 handles project names
          case insensitive.

Sun Nov 30 10:40:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          When duplicates our not allowed and duplicates are found, then output
          an error instead of a warning

Sun Nov 30 10:22:29 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi  <kobi-co@barak-online.net>

        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/Task_Ex_Test.icc:
        * tests/Task_Ex_Test.dsp:
        * tests/Makefile.am:
        Added Task_Ex_Test to Makefile.am and tests.dsw
        Added Task_Ex_Test.icc, Task_Ex_Test.dsp

Sat Nov 29 15:25:36 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-lite.h: (new file)
        * ace/config-all.h:
          Added new file, config-lite.h, and moved most of the code,
          except for the includes, from config-all.h to the new file,
          and included it in config-all.h.  Since some of the files
          included by config-all.h in turn include config-all.h, we
          ended up with a circular include problem on some platforms.  The
          new file eliminates the problem by separating the includes from
          the definitions.

        * ace/ACE_export.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stdarg.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stddef.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stdio.h:
          Include config-lite.h instead of config-all.h to avoid
          circular include problem.  Most, if not all, of the files in
          ace/os_include need only config-lite.h, but these are the only
          files that currently have the circular include problem.  Future
          subsetting can address the rest after the release.

Fri Nov 28 17:08:34 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/README: Added this file with some basic information on
          Kokyu and pointing to the Kokyu html documents under Kokyu/docs.

Fri Nov 28 17:17:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Caching_Strategies_T.i: Added #include "ace/OS_Memory.h" so
          ACE_NEW can be found properly when inlined methods are used without
          the .cpp file, such as when instantiating templates in AIX Visual
          Age C++.

        * ace/Cache_Map_Manager_T.cpp: Added #include "ace/Log_Msg.h" to
          find ACE_ERROR, et al.

        * ace/Env_Value_T.h: Added #include "ace/Global_Macros.h" to
          get ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC and "ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h" to get
          strtol, strtoul.

        * ace/Reverse_Lock_T.inl: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_errno.h" so
          errno can be found properly when inlined methods are used without
          the .cpp file, such as when instantiating templates in AIX Visual
          Age C++.

        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.{h, cpp}: Added #include "ace/Null_Mutex.h"
          to find ACE_Null_Mutex. Moved the Printer and Scheduler class
          definitions from Bound_Ptr_Test.cpp to a new file, Bound_Ptr_Test.h
          so AIX Visual Age C++ can find it when instantiating templates.

        * tests/Buffer_Stream_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Cached_Accept_Conn_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Cached_Allocator_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Cached_Conn_Test.cpp:

        * tests/MT_Reactor_Upcall_Test.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to get string functions.

        * tests/Cache_Map_Manager_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h"
          to get atoi() and srand(), and "ace/OS_Memory.h" for ACE_NEW.

        * tests/Capabilities_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_fcntl.h" to
          get open() and "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h" to get write().

        * tests/Conn_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_select.h" to get
          select() and the proper mutex header, Thread_Mutex.h, Null_Mutex.h,
          or Process_Mutex.h.

        * tests/Conn_Test.h: Added #include "ace/Null_Condition.h" so the
          template parent has it available when instantiating templates.

        * tests/Env_Value_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Get_Opt_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Handle_Set_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Hash_Map_Bucket_Iterator_Test.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h" to get itoa().

        * tests/Future_Set_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h"
          and "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h" to get missing symbols on AIX.

        * tests/Future_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_time.h" to get
          gettimeofday() and "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to get strlen().

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" to get
          sprintf().

Fri Nov 28 11:21:05 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        The following are fixes for problems exposed by running
        `autoreconf' with the "--warnings=all" command line option.

        * configure.ac:

          Precompute the absolute path of the ACE "tests" build
          directory.

        * Makefile.am (CONFIGURE_DEPENDENCIES):

          Updated configure script dependency list to reflect latest set
          of M4 filenames.

        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * ace/QoS/Makefile.am:
        * ace/RMCast/Makefile.am:
        * ace/SSL/Makefile.am:
        * apps/gperf/src/Makefile.am:
        * tests/SSL/Makefile.am:

          "INCLUDES" -> "AM_CPPFLAGS".  The former is obsolete.

        * tests/Makefile.am (libdir):

          Do not set this variable to the absolute path of the current
          working directory via the "$(shell pwd)" GNU Make extension.
          Instead pre-compute it inside the `configure' script, and then
          substitute the actual value inside the generated Makefile.
          "$(shell pwd)" is not portable to non-GNU Make implementations.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Ran `autoupdate' on this file to update obsolete Autoconf
          macros.  In particular, "AC_HELP_STRING" is now
          "AS_HELP_STRING".

Fri Nov 28 15:37:36 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
          Added Task_Ex_Test

Fri Nov 28 15:34:53 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
          Added missing # before include.

Fri Nov 28 15:11:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_core_exe.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_core_library.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_dll.bor:

        * include/makeinclude/outputdir.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/recurse.bor
          Added missing id tag

Fri Nov 28 14:59:03 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Updated Cygwin documentation, use GCC 3.2.3 and select DOS
          as default text file type.

Fri Nov 28 08:56:50 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp (import_config): Rearranged
          the code a bit to avoid declaring the "end" variable multiple
          times in the loop.  Thanks to Moran Levi for suggesting this.

Fri Nov 28 14:31:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Fixed error in my previous change.

Fri Nov 28 14:03:53 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Moved ACE_OS::mutex_init() above ACE_OS::event_init() to fix
          internal compiler error with Cygwin.

Fri Nov 28 13:43:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Also check for Id string in the .bor files.

Thu Nov 27 10:40:32 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp (import_config): The
          problem: when importing a configuration from file - the import
          process assumes maximum line length of 4096 bytes (which means
          actually about 1360 bytes because each byte is represented as
          three bytes in the output file).  The solution is to use a
          dynamic buffer to load a line from the file. If the load did not
          reach the end of the line - resize the buffer and continue until
          the end of the line is reached.  Thanks to Moran Levi
          <moran@monosphere.com> for the fixes.

Thu Nov 27 16:51:31 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/ARGV_Test.cpp:

          Fixed compile errors on Win32.

Thu Nov 27 10:51:00 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
          Added new variable, LIB_INSTALL that contains the libraries that
          should be installed and added it as a dependency of BIN so that
          the libs will get installed prior to building the BIN that depends
          on it.

Wed Nov 26 18:36:04 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/ARGV_Test.cpp:

          Fixed compile errors, mostly related to missing includes.

Wed Nov 26 17:09:32 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed a compile error with VC6.

Wed Nov 26 12:10:22 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_signal.h: Put the typedef for ACE_SIGNAL_C_FUNC inside
          of an extern "C" block to quiet warnings on Solaris.  Thanks to
          Kevin Heifner <heifner_k@ociweb.com> for this suggestion!

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: Made the sig_handler() function static
          so that it won't "leak" out of ACE!

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp (test_format_specs):
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): ACE_Log_Msg::log has a number of problems
          when ACE is built with ACE_USES_WCHAR
          1) %m needs to convert strerror to wide string
          2) %I should not use memset to set spaces in wide string
          3) recent modifications to remove dependencies on ACE_TRACE
             prevent %I from indenting
          Thanks to Duane Binder for these fixes. Fixes [BUGID 1660]

Wed Nov 26 12:15:22 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Blocked a number of tests from running in if messaging is disabled.

Wed Nov 26 17:41:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Changed TAO FT flags and libs

Wed Nov 26 10:11:20 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/ARGV_Test.cpp: Added new functions to test the fixes by
          Duane Binder below.

        * ace/Argv_Type_Converter.cpp (cleanup): Ensure we don't try to
          delete memory that wasn't allocated dynamically.  Thanks to
          Duane Binder <duane.binder@veritas.com> for reporting this and
          providing a fix.  This fixes bugid 1658.

        * ace/Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log.cpp (open):
          ACE_Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log::open() has a problem with passing the
          program name to ACE_TEXT_RegSetValueEx.  It is passing
          msg_file_length.  msg_file_length is defined as
          ACE_OS::strlen(msg_file).  Unfortunately, this is 1/2 the
          required buffer length since this argument is defined in bytes,
          not in characters. End result - the event log message file entry
          is truncated resulting in the log message file not found.
          Thanks to Duane Binder <duane.binder@veritas.com> for reporting
          this and providing a fix.  This fixes bugid 1659.

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: Changed sig_handler() to be extern "C".
          Thanks to Chris Cleeland for suggesting this fix.

        * ace/Process.{h,cpp}: Fixed the ACE_Process_Options::command_line_argv()
          method so that it doesn't modify the command_line_buf_ parameter
          directly since this messes things up when process_name() is
          used.  Thanks to Dror Tirosh <ace@dror.mailshell.com> for reporting
          this.

Wed Nov 26 16:09:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresytems.com>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Signal_Task.h:

          Added #include "jaws3/Export.h" and add JAWS_Export to

          Added sctp and xt_reactor to the list of features.

Tue Nov 25 12:34:15 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DLL.h: Made the constructors explicit.

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fix for one of the problems that showed up in TAO. For some
          reason  we were passing in a "0" to the constructor
          ACE_Service_Type that was expecting a const ACE_DLL &. None of
          the compilers complained about this, since they created
          temporary. This created all sorts of problems once this "Sun Nov
          23 11:00:02 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt
          <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>" went through since it added a new
          constructor.

          We have now fixed it by creating a temporary and forcing the
          compiler to use the right constructor of ACE_Service_Type. This
          shouldn't be harmful, since we were expecting just this.

Tue Nov 25 14:13:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
          Include rules.bin.GNU after rules.lib.GNU so that dependencies
          can be correctly set.  Use definition of DIRS to decide whether
          to include rules.nested.GNU or rules.nonested.GNU.
          rules.nested.GNU is needed to recurse directories if DIRS is
          defined.

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
          Include rules.nonested.GNU instead of rules.nested.GNU to enable

Mon Nov 24 18:30:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added a $(TAO_IDL_DEP) target that emits an error if the
          $(TAO_IDL_DEP) doesn't exist.  Thanks to Carlos for
          motivating this and suggesting the use of /bin/false to force
          make to see the error.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Only cleanup shared libraries when shared_libs is defined and

          b
          just for existence, since they always exist by this time.

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Removed the multiple assignments to BUILD from
          wrapper_macros.GNU and all_in_one.GNU and replaced them with a
          single assignment to VBUILD in rules.local.GNU.  VBUILD always
          includes the following targets: IDL_SRC, VLIBS, VBIN, then
          filters out any of these already in BUILD and includes them too.
          IDL_SRC and the V* targets get defined in the appropriate
          rules.*.GNU file or Makefile or are defined in rules.local.GNU
          prior to use.  If VBIN has not yet been defined when
          rules.local.GNU is loaded, but BIN has been (because BIN or
          BIN_UNCHECKED was defined in the Makefile but rules.bin.GNU
          wasn't included), VBIN is defined in terms of BIN, and is set to
          depend on VLIBS.  VLIBS is defined in rules.lib.GNU and
          discussed below.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
          Assign VLIB and/or VSHLIB and VSHLIBA to VLIBS if either
          static_libs and/or shared_libs is defined, respectively.  Added
          a rule that they depend on IDL_SRC if it's defined, which will
          insure that they are built first.  Issue warning if this file
          was included but no *LIB or *LIB_UNCHECKED variables were defined.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
          Modified the BIN target to command to use the specific objects
          from the dependency list instead of $^ which takes all the
          dependencies, even those added elsewhere--make is evil in this
          respect.  Since objects could be listed multiple times, sort is
          used to remove duplicates. Added dependency rules making VBIN
          dependent on VLIBS and IDL_SRC.  Issue warning if this file is
          included and BIN or BIN_UNCHECKED wasn't defined.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          In addition to the BUILD changes noted above, added
          makefile.local target the prints out the name of the Makefile in
          use.  This really helpful in big directories with lots of
          Makefiles.  Set the SUFFIXES to nothing so that implicit rule
          matching based on suffixes is turn off--we only want our
          explicit rules to fire.  Removed the IDL_SRC dependency rule
          added below since it was redundant and already handled in
          rules.tao.GNU.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Removed VBIN assignment since it belongs in rules.bin.GNU and/or
          rules.local.GNU and is no longer needed here since the BUILD
          variable assignments were removed as noted above.  Added
          comments on how to use the various variables.

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Makefile:
          Added -lGateway to LDLIBS and removed the VBIN target dependency
          lists.

        * apps/Gateway/Peer/Makefile:
          Added -lPeer to LDLIBS and removed the VBIN target dependency

          on win2k/XP when OS support up to 1024 slots,  but MS-sdk
          defines TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE as 64. Now, Win2k/XP Users can

Thu Nov 20 18:11:32 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Object.{h,cpp}: Added a new constructor for

Fri Nov 21 13:26:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * *Makefile*:

        * include/makeinclude/macros.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.common.GNU:
          Added cleanup_idl_stubs.  It was already there as a .local
          target, now it can be called directly.  This allows you to
          cleanup the idl stub code for a particular project without
          having to run realclean which will cleanup all everything in the
          directory.

Fri Nov 21 07:24:07 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Moved the declaration of $config_list to before the if(!getopt
          line, since it's used there if the if is satisfied.  Removed the
          ":" after a in the getopt argument list, since -a does not take
          a mandatory argument (which is what ":" means).  This has
          prevented any tests from running in the ACE only autobuilds.
          since September.

Fri Nov 21 02:57:35 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        This is a major reorganization of the make system, and was
        motivated by intermittent build errors in the autobuilds as well
        as the pending move to MPC.  Sorry if it's a little long, it's in
        a quasi Irfan-Bala style...

        Specific changes are noted below, but here's a basic overview:

        clean: Cleans up only the objects actually created by the
          current project.  If multiple makefiles exist in the same
          directory, they no longer need to be completely rebuilt because
          another makefile issued a clean.  This will help in large
          directories like $(ACE_ROOT)tests or
          $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.  These objects are cleaned up even
          if a particular feature is not enabled, e.g., rmcast, ssl,
          Other, etc., and is not dependent on bin/ace_components or the
          files it maintains.  So, for normal development, prefer clean
          over realclean.

        realclean: Cleans up everything, including the removal of the
          .obj or .shobj directories, and any IDL files, e.g., *C.h, etc.
          Like clean:, it also cleans up objects whether or not the
          feature is currently enabled, thus obviating reverseclean:
          entirely.  Also removed the multiple $(RM) lines.  Each clean
          target now only invokes $(RM) a single time, and they aren't
          invoked at all in Makefiles that don't actually build anything.
          This reduced the time to run realclean on TAO by about 10%.

        BUILD:  It now includes $(IDL_SRC) as the first dependency, so
          that idl_stubs is always invoked first if needed.  It also
          includes, in order, $(VLIB), $(VSHLIB), and $(VSHLIBA),
          depending on the values of static_libs and shared_libs.
          Finally, it includes $(VBIN) so that it's the last thing built.
          This ordering will always work even in parallel builds, -jn
          with n > 1, since dependencies are processed in order.  Had
          these target just satisfied other rules, but were not explicitly
          ordered, make would have tried to build them at the same time.
          This should fix most of the parallel build autobuild errors.

        depend: Now depends on idl_studs, so you no longer have to run
          both in order.  depend will invoke idl_stubs if needed.  It also
          uses $(VDIR) instead of a hard coded .obj/ value, and removes
          the config-*h files even if it's run in the $(ACE_ROOT)/ace
          directory, but leaves config-all.h and a new variable file,
          $(ACE_PLATFORM_CONFIG), which can be set in the appropriate
          platform_*.GNU file to correspond to the matching config-*.h
          file.  For instance, it is set to config-linux.h in
          platform_macros.GNU so that changes to config-linux.h will
          insure recompilation on Linux.  It defaults to config.h if not
          set in platform_*.GNU.  $(PSRC) is now set to $(addsuffix .cpp,
          $(CLEANUP_BIN)), where $(CLEANUP_BIN) is either $(BIN) or
          $(BIN_UNCHECKED) or $(BIN2), $(BIN_UNCHECKED) is heavily used in
          TAO and MPC, and $(BIN2) is heavily used in ACE, so both are
          maintained. This insures that it will be added to the
          dependencies even if the developer forgets to add it to the
          Makefile.  In fact, it's here so it doesn't have to be added to
          the Makefile.

        install/deinstall:  These are somewhat problematic, since they
          *must* be installed to actually run anything, but now they
          install exactly what you build, $(LIB) or $(SHLIB), and
          deinstall the same even if the feature isn't enabled, as in
          clean above.  Also, the versioning code was modified a bit to
          make it easier to understand and make deinstall work correctly.

        $(IDL_SRC): This target was added here, because adding it to
          $(TAO)/rules_tao.GNU wouldn't work correctly due to backward
          compatibility issues.  Anyway, it depends on $(IDL_FILES) and
          will force idl_stubs to be run if any of the idl files change.
          Unfortunately, we can't yet generate dependencies for idl files,
          but perhaps that won't be hard to add in the future.

        component_check.GNU:  Including this file is similar to calling a
          function with named parameters, it's been altered to let you
          include it as many times as you want.  It will probably evolve
          over time, but currently, you add of list of all components that
          you want to tests to an input variable, REQUIRED_COMPONENTS,
          include the file, then test to see if the return variable,
          MISSING_COMPONENTS, contains any of the components specified in
          REQUIRED_COMPONENTS, if it does, these components are missing,
          i.e., not specified in either platform_macros.GNU, the
          commandline, or contained in any of the ace_components files.
          For example, if you want to test for ssl and Other, you'd do
          something like this:

            REQUIRED_COMPONENTS = ssl Other
            include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/component_check.GNU
            ifneq ($(MISSING_COMPONENTS),)
              all:
                     @echo Missing $(MISSING_COMPONENTS)
            endif

          This should greatly simplify Makefiles in general and MPC
          templates in particular.

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/component_check.GNU:
          Moved the code that set the BIN, LIB, and SHLIB variable from
          component_check.GNU to all_in_one.GNU, and removed the include
          guards from component_check.GNU so it could be included multiple
          times like a function call.  Also, set the BUILD to the correct
          values depending on which variables are set (BUILD is also set
          correctly in wrapper_macros.GNU, but this implementation should
          be more correct if all_in_one.GNU is used instead of including
          the other files individually).

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
        * bin/g++dep:
          Added ACE_PLATFORM_CONFIG = config-linux.h, so that
          config-linux.h will always be included in dependencies on
          Linux.  Added default value of config.h to wrapper_macros.GNU,
          and pass it to g++dep where it is used to replace the matching
          file dependency with $(ACE_PLATFORM_CONFIG) so we can pick up
          the correct dependency automatically on each platform.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_kcc.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:
          Moved the assignment of the CLEANUP_* variables to the top of
          wrapper_macros.GNU, and changed the test in the two platform_*
          files from BIN to CLEANUP_BIN, so they can be correctly tested
          even if BIN_UNCHECKED of BIN2 was defined in the Makefile
          instead of BIN.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
          Assign CLEANUP_BIN to PSRC so that it gets passed to depend and
          dependencies are generated even if the component isn't enabled
          or not explicitly included in VOBJS which is derived from SRC.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
          Modified the versioning variables and created CLEANUP_INSTALL so
          that libraries can be installed and uninstalled correctly even
          if components are currently enabled.  Cosmetic fixes to the
          ifdef code to make it more readable, added comments.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          More cosmetic changes to make it more readable.  Added
          CLEANUP_OBJDIRS to make it easier to keep track of what
          directories need to be removed during clean and realclean.
          Condensed the clean and install/deinstall target code to use
          fewer rm calls and only call them if there's something to do.
          Also, only cleanup the library or bin that was created,
          including a specific version number if available.  These use the
          special CLEANUP_* variables so they aren't dependent on whether
          or not a feature or component is enabled.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added $(IDL_SRC) to all the BUILD variables (there are lots of
          them), so that they are always generated first if defined.
          Commented out the assignment of $(VSHDIR) to $(VDIR) is building
          shared_libs_only and not on VXWORKS.  This doesn't seem right,
          especially if we are building bins and libs in the same directory.

Thu Nov 20 17:30:18 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h: HP-UX supplies the socklen_t type
          unless some feature set less than _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is
          specifically requested. However, it only actually uses the
          socklen_t type in supplied socket functions if
          _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is specifically requested. So, for example,
          the compile options ACE usually uses (includes -mt) cause
          _HPUX_SOURCE to be set, which sets _INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
          (causing socklen_t to be defined) but _not_ _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
          (causing socket functions to use int, not socklen_t).

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h (ACE_rwlock_t): Uncomment the two lines that
          set "typedef pthread_rwlock_t ACE_rwlock_t" for
          ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (rw_trywrlock_upgrade): Add "defined
          (ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT)" to the platforms that return
          ENOTSUP for this. Avoids tripping over the code that emulates it
          without having the emulated lock type set up.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.h: Change #include "ace/os_include/sys/os_types.h"
          to "ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h" to get the proper struct stat
          definition for the platform. Fixes compile error on HP-UX.

Thu Nov 20 09:35:01 2003  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/fault_tolerance.mpb:
          New--to support fault tolerance mpc files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcsexe.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoexe.mpb:
          Add IDL includes to match CPP includes.

Thu Nov 20 07:51:59 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_uio.cpp: "Short-circuit the readv_emulation() and
          writev_emulation() for the case where there's just a single
          element in the iovec.  Thanks to Edan Ayal <edanayal@yahoo.com>
          for contributing this.

Wed Nov 19 11:55:43 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Mem_Map.i (map): Reverted the change from

          Mon Nov 17 17:09:37 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

          since this isn't the right fix.  Thanks to Kitty for noting this.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUDependencyWriter.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Modifications that decrease the time to generate dependencies by
          7 percent.

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Added the -n option to the usage and updated the version number.

Wed Nov 19 09:53:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-7.h:

          MSVC 7 supports templates class specialization.

Tue Nov 18 22:31:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/naming.mpb:

          Naming service now depends on messaging.

Tue Nov 18 22:12:53 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
        * ace/Log_Msg.h:

          Fixed warnings in the daily builds. Further, made some cosmetic
          changes.

Tue Nov 18 21:25:23 2003  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * html/index.html:
          Configured the index.html to display CIAO doxygen information.

Tue Nov 18 15:58:00 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (AC_PROC_CC, AC_PROG_CPP, AC_PROG_CC_C_O):

          No need to check for a C compiler and preprocessor.  ACE is only
          compiled with a C++ compiler.

          (AC_LIBTOOL_TAGS):

          Added call to this Libtool autoconf macro to only enable C++
          library support.  C and FORTRAN support are unnecessary.  Note
          that this forces a requirement on Libtool 1.5 or better.

          (ACE_CHECK_TLS):

          Only run the OpenSSL detection tests if SSL support is enabled
          by the user.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Enable TLS/SSL support by default.

        * m4/aio.m4:
        * m4/features.m4:

          Renamed `features.m4' file to `aio.m4' to better reflect the
          contents of this file, namely asynchronous IO checks.

        * m4/config_h.m4 (AH_BOTTOM):

          Prevent Emacs from inadvertently applying the "Local Variables"
          block to be placed in the generated "config.h" header to this
          Autoconf/M4 file by splitting the words "Local" and "Variables"
          into two separate concatenated M4 quoted blocks.

        * m4/tls.m4:

          New Autoconf OpenSSL detection tests.

        * ace/Makefile.am (clean-local):

          Updated list of additional files/directories unknown to the
          standard "clean" target to be cleaned.

        * ace/SSL/Makefile.am:

          (AM_CPPFLAGS):

          Add preprocessor flags necessary to build applications with
          OpenSSL support.  Detected at "configure-time".

          (libACE_SSL_la_LIBADD):

          Link the OpenSSL libraries detected at "configure-time."

        * tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS):

          Build the SSL test subdirectory.

          (noinst_SCRIPTS):

          Removed non-existent files from this list.  Fixes some build
          problems.

          (libTest_Output_la_LDFLAGS):

          Removed "-module" libtool flag from libTest_Output.* linker
          flags.  This library is meant to be linked at build time, not
          loaded dynamically.

          (*_SOURCES, LDADD):

          No need to add `Main.cpp' to all test source lists.  Simply
          adding `Main.o' to $(LDADD) is much cleaner and provides the
          same effect.

          (Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test_SOURCES):

          Fixed source file list.  This test is now built correctly.

          (EXTRA_DIST):

          Added `Main.cpp' to the list of files to be explicitly
          distributed with the ACE distribution when building a
          distribution with the Autoconf support.

          (all-local):

          "$(top_srcdir/tests" -> "$(srcdir)".  The latter is cleaner and
          provides the same effect/result.

          (clean-local):

          Updated list of additional files/directories unknown to the
          standard "clean" target to be cleaned.

          (distclean-local):

          Removed `bin' directory from the list of directories to be
          erased.  It hasn't been generated for quite some time.

        * tests/SSL/Makefile.am:

          New Automake Makefile template for the ACE_SSL library test.

Tue Nov 18 16:37:21 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/DEV_SAP/reader/reader.cpp (main): Changed
          recv_n() to recv() so that the underlying Windows Read()
          function is called properly (recv_n() doesn't call this).
          Thanks to Mike Gingell <mike.gingell@drdc-rddc.gc.ca> for
          reporting this.

Tue Nov 18 16:03:10 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for the following patches:

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_mman.inl:
          Added #include OS_NS_sys_stat.h if __Lynx__ is defined.

        * ace/RMCast/RMCast.h:
          Added #include /**/ <bsd/mbuf.h> before #undef'ing MT_DATA if
          __Lynx__ is defined, since it's MT_DATA is defined in this file.

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.cpp:
          Changed NULL to 0 to fix compile problem on LynxOS.

Tue Nov 18 15:01:49 2003  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Time / time and date stamps can now be placed on log entries by
          defining the environment property ACE_LOG_TIMESTAMP to be one of
          'TIME' / 'DATE'. This fixes bug #1635.

Tue Nov 18 08:11:52 2003  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

Tue Nov 18 05:12:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
          Added ability to include an arbitrary Makefile passed as
          ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE, and added BUILD rule dependency of idl_stubs
          if IDL_SRC is defined.  Added TAO_ROOT is not already defined.

Mon Nov 17 20:34:27 2003  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

Mon Nov 17 20:00:14 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Default_Constants.h:

          Added a new #define ACE_IPV6_LOCALHOST. The
          ACE_DEFAULT_SERVER_HOST would point to ACE_IPV6_LOCALHOST if
          IPV6 is enabled and ACE_LOCALHOSt of IPV4 is used.

          Thanks to Bryan Bruesker for providing the patches.

Mon Nov 17 18:55:49 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Asynch_Connector.cpp:

          Use ACE_reinterpret_cast instead of a C style casts.

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:

          Fixed a problem with the ACE_INET_Addr::set () method, where the
          type and  size of this object were not being set. This could
          cause a problem when  the type of sa is different than the type
          of this ACE_INET_Addr. Even  though the inet_addr_ member will
          be set correctly, the type and size  will be, making the state
          of the ACE_INET_Addr inconsistent.

        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.h:
        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.i:

          Added a get_addresses method () that takes a sockaddr_in6* as
          argument, so  that if the  ACE_Multihomed_INET_Addr is storing
          only IPv6 addresses, they can all be put into an array of
          sockaddr_in6 by this method. Further, changed the variable name
          within the class to be secondaries_, ie. with an underscore.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp:

          Added a memset to make_multicast_ifaddr6 to ensure that the
          ipv6_mreq is zero'ed out before using it.


          Thanks to Bryan Bruesker for providing the patches.

        * include/makeinclude/component_check.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added new variable, ACE_MAKE_OPTIONS, to wrapper_macros.GNU that
          collects all the flags passed to make, e.g., ssl, sctp, rmcast,
          etc....  Use this variable in component_check.GNU so that we
          only have to add new flags one place.

Tue Nov 18 00:04:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
          Fixed variable tests and changed the order variables are added
          to BUILD, i.e., put the libraries first, then the bins.  This
          insures the libs are built first if a Makefile builds both libs
          and executables.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Makefile:
          Removed the special BIN target with a dependency on SHLIB, since
          this is now handled automagically by the above rule.

Mon Nov 17 17:09:37 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Mem_Map.i (map): Disable the use of MAP_FIXED on Linux
          since it seems to cause problems.  Thanks to Lothar Werzinger
          <lothar@xcerla.com> for this fix.

Mon Nov 17 21:50:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Renamed the CLEAN_* variables to CLEANUP_*, and moved them from
          rules.local.GNU to wrapper_macros.GNU.

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/component_check.GNU:
          Added new files that simplify the makefile systems.
          all_in_one.GNU replaces and conditionally includes all the other
          standard makeinclude files.  It also includes the new
          component_check.GNU file that handles all the conditional
          compilation rules.  All you need to do is add a list of required
          components needed for the particular project, e.g., rmcast,
          shared_libs, Other, etc..., to REQUIRED_COMPONENTS and then
          include all_in_one.GNU. These files will simplify MPC a great
          deal.

        * netsvcs/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Logger/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile.Dump_Restore:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile.main:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/collection/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/deadlock/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/invariant/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/mutex/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/rw_lock/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/lib/Makefile:
        * netsvcs/servers/Makefile:
          Modified these Makefiles to use the new all_in_one.GNU file
          above and updated dependencies.  This is mainly a test and
          example for future MPC implementations.

Mon Nov 17 16:37:49 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU: Moved the AIX shr.o-building stuff
          out of the main path of the VSHLIB rule. Avoids bulding the shr.o
          file with the SOVERSION suffix. Now the shr.o file is made without
          decoration, inserted into the .a file, then deleted. The .a file
          is correctly decorated and installed.

Sun Nov 16 23:49:02 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.h:

          Fixed a typo in the interface documentation.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:

          In shared_open () used INADDR_ANY when calling bind_port ()
          instead of 0.

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.cpp:

          Modifies the call to bind_port in open () so that if the address
          passed in is the any address, the protocol is passed to
          bind_port so that when IPv6 is enabled, it will bind to the IPv6
          any address instead of the IPv4 one

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:

          Modified bind_port () so that if the protocol specified is
          PF_INET6 and the IP address is not INADDR_ANY, then the address
          will be set to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address before doing the
          bind.

          Thanks to Brian Buesker <bbuesker@qualcomm.com> for the
          patches.

Sun Nov 16 23:08:16 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/footprint_stats.sh:

          Removed Smart_Proxies from the daily build since it made no
          sense to have that. Added new libraries like the Valuetype that
          we would like to track to the daily stats pages.

Sun Nov 16 18:33:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Reactor.cpp:
          Added #include Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h.

Fri Nov 14 15:17:30 2003  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (get_host_addr): Fixed these two methods so
          that they work properly on vxworks.  They used to work in 1.2a,
          but those changes got lost during an IPv6 refactoring after the
          release of DOC 1.2.1.  This should close [RT 3183].

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.cpp: Added a test for the augmented
          version of get_host_addr.

Fri Nov 14 15:55:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_select.h:
          Rolled back change from Thu Nov 13 23:22:21 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com> which was incorrect.  The
          ACE_HAS_SELECT_H refers to <sys/select.h>.

Fri Nov 14 10:50:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_wait.inl:
          Moved the wait method below the waitpid method. After searching for
          hours for the internal compiler error MinGW has the solution was
          to easy to think of. Because wait calls waitpid it must be below
          waitpid in the inline file. This fixes the internal compiler
          error in the MinGW build and restores the order of wait and waitpid
          to the state before the ACE_OS split up.

Fri Nov 14 00:42:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp:
        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.cpp:
          Test for !ACE_LACKS_RTTI to #ifdef away dynamic_cast test.  Add
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG around dll if ACE_LACKS_RTTI is defined to quash
          unused arg warning.

Thu Nov 13 23:22:21 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_select.h:
          Added missing #include of select.h when ACE_HAS_SELECT_H is
          defined.

        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp:
        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.cpp:
          #ifdef away the dynamic_cast test if ACE_LACKS_RTTI is defined.

Thu Nov 13 16:22:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Make the check for sys/select.h set
          ACE_LACKS_SYS_SELECT_H is _not_ found. Added a check of select.h
          that sets ACE_HAS_SELECT_H. Changed further code tests that used
          ACE_HAS_SELECT_H to include <sys/select.h> to use
          ACE_LACKS_SYS_SELECT_H instead.

        * m4/config_h.m4: Added AH_TEMPLATE for ACE_LACKS_SYS_SELECT_H.

Thu Nov 13 19:56:53 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ASNMP/tests/Octet_Test.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_string.h.

        Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for the following fixes need to
        compile ACE on LynxOS.

        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_Thread.h if ACE_HAS_TSS_EMULATION is defined.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_stdio.h and OS_NS_sys_stat.h if
          ACE_LAKCS_MKTEMP is defined.

        * ace/OS_NS_strings.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_ctype.h if ACE_LACKS_STRCASECMP is defined.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_WCHAR_H, ACE_LACKS_REGEX_H, and
          ACE_LACKS_TCP_NODELAY.

Thu Nov 13 12:54:35 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          When defining OBJS, always use $(notdir $(FILES)).

Thu Nov 13 18:39:15 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AC_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp:
        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp:
        * examples/C++NPv2/TPC_Logging_Server.cpp:
          Added #include os_netdb.h to get MAXHOSTNAMELEN.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-client.h:
          Fixed typo, missing "ace" in #include path.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_select.h.

        * examples/OS/Process/process.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_stdio.h.

        * examples/QOS/Diffserv/diffserv_test.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_string.h.

Thu Nov 13 12:13:28 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Changed the behavior of the -n option to only exclude inline files
          that are not included by the cpp file being processed.

Thu Nov 13 17:37:04 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/DEV_Addr.{cpp,i}:
          Moved #include os_socket.h from .cpp to .i since it is needed
          there, removed #include SString.h from .i and added
          OS_NS_string.h and Global_Macros.h, then moved the #include's in
          .cpp to below the #include of .i so that the inlined and
          non-inlined builds would behave the same.

        * ace/SString.i:
          Added #include ACE.h if not already included, e.g., when
          ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE isn't defined.

Thu Nov 13 17:39:19 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
          Remove #define ACE_SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE, since this value
          is hardcoded for 32-bit platforms.  Dan Eischen
          <deischen@freebsd.org> reported that this caused the
          Basic_Types_Test to fail on 64-bit FreeBSD platforms.
          The correct value for this constant is defined later
          on in Basic_Types.h by including <float.h>.

Thu Nov 13 11:27:23 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Added an option (-n) to produce dependencies with no inline files.

Thu Nov 13 17:14:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_ERRNO_H and ACE_LACKS_TIME_H.

        * ace/config-all.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stddef.h:
          Fixed typo's in rarely accessed #ifdef'd sections.

Thu Nov 13 16:18:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Added #include Guard_T.h and Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h when
          ACE_HAS_IPV6 is defined.

Thu Nov 13 16:10:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/File_Parser.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_stdlib.h to fix compile errors on HP.

        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-acceptor.h:
        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.h:
          Added #include Signal.h to fix compile errors on HP.

Thu Nov 13 16:11:07 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_TLI.h:
          Fixed a typo by changing the test to determine whether or not to
          include os_tcp.h and #undef TCP_NODELY and TCP_MAXSEG to avoid a
          conflict with sys/xti.h from ACE_HAS_BROKEN_XTI_MACROS to
          ACE_HAS_CONFLICTING_XTI_MACROS.  This should fix compile
          problems in HP.

        * ace/os_include/netinet/os_tcp.h:
          Removed the ACE_HAS_CONFLICTING_XTI_MACROS test that #undef'd
          TCP_NODELAY and TCP_MAXSEG.  This only needs to be done prior to
          including sys/xti.h.

Thu Nov 13 04:26:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU;
          Added # -*- Makefile -*- at the top of the file so emacs will
          highlight the syntax.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added explicit shared library with version extension to the
          deinstall.local target so that it will get cleaned up even if it
          is only defined as SHLIB_UNCHECKED.

Thu Nov 13 03:32:14 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Rolled back the part of Wed Nov 12 12:43:14 2003  Chad Elliott
          <elliott_c@ociweb.com> that added a line to realclean to remove
          the *_UNCHECKED files.  This is unnecessary and doesn't work
          with specialized targets, see Wed Nov 12 07:40:27 UTC 2003  Don
          Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com> for details.

Wed Nov 12 16:55:00 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

Wed Nov 12 12:43:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added LIB_UNCHECKED and SHLIB_UNCHECKED.  Added a line to the

          SHLIB_UNCHECKED.

Wed Nov 12 11:21:55 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

          processed on Windows depending on where mwc.pl was run.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug in a warning message.  The wrong project name was
          being displayed.

Wed Nov 12 16:44:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>"

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_time.inl:
          Fixed typo.

Wed Nov 12 15:42:31 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-macosx.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_SEARCH_H.

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_WCHAR_H and ACE_LACKS_PWD_H.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          Added #include OS_NS_stdio.h if ACE_LACKS_ACCESS is defined.
          Added #include os_unistd.h if VXWORKS or ACE_HAS_WINCE is
          define.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_time.inl:
          Added #include OS_NS_time.h if VXWORKS, CHORUS, or ACE_PSOS is

Wed Nov 12 09:26:48 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Use CLEAN_LIB and CLEAN_SHLIB for the deinstall.local target as
          well.

Wed Nov 12 08:44:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Makefile:
          Moved the BIN variable up to top of file (above
          rules.common.GNU), and removed rules.bin.GNU, since the targets
          are explicitly defined.  Otherwise nothing gets cleanup during
          realclean.

Wed Nov 12 07:40:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added CLEAN_BIN, CLEAN_LIB, CLEAN_SHLIB, and CLEAN_SHLIBA
          variables that are assigned the values of BIN or BIN_UNCHECKED,
          etc values.  Changed the realclean target to use the CLEAN_*
          variables instead of the BIN/BIN2, etc., variables.  This will
          insure that realclean removes these files even if the
          ace_components files have already been removed.  The *2 variety
          were add by David Levine,  Mon Apr 12 14:24:28 1999  David
          L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>, but newer projects, especially
          in TAO, have begun using the *_UNCHECKED naming scheme.  Since
          these files where often dependent on the ace_components files,
          they never got cleaned up. This should also obviates the need
          for the reverseclean target.

        * netsvcs/Makefile:
          Removed ace_components test from around the DIRS variable.  You
          should always descend into the directories and give them the
          opportunity to clean themselves up.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Makefile:
          Added use of *_UNCHECKED variables so that these files will get
          cleanup during a realclean.

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
          Added Service_Config_Test and Framework_Component_Test to the
          BIN2 variable if not being built so that they will always get
          deleted during a realclean.

Tue Nov 11 18:48:27 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Map_Manager_Test.cpp:

          Renamed the variable ENTRY to MAP_ENTRY since it was clashing
          with system headers.

Tue Nov 11 18:02:56 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp (ts_object):

          Added the change "Mon Nov 10 22:30:14 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi
          <kobi@mivzak.com>"  back into the repo. The actual problem lay
          elsewhere. Please see below.


          The double checked locking optimization in ts_init () was the
          culprit. After grabbing the lock, if the check for null pointer
          fails, meaning it was already allocated, just return 0 instead
          of a -1. This should fix most of the runtime problems that we
          saw in the builds today.

Tue Nov 11 17:25:10 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:

          Reverting the change "Mon Nov 10 22:30:14 2003  Kobi Cohen-Arazi
          <kobi@mivzak.com>". The change is so benign that the problem is
          elsewhere. This change just triggered something else. Reverting
          this since our daily builds can run properly.

Tue Nov 11 12:20:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug in the implicitly generated dependencies where actual
          inter-project dependencies would be abandoned in favor of
          implicitly generated dependencies.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Make sure that PWD is set before it is used.

Tue Nov 11 17:09:46 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added new check, check_for_makefile_variable, to verify that
          MAKEFILE variable is correct and that Makefile's not named just
          "Makefile" without an extension, have a MAKEFILE variable.  Added
          check for spaces around "=" to dependency file check.  Added
          makefiles to the ID check.

          Added MAKEFILE variable, and updated dependencies.

Mon Nov 10 17:02:37 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:

          Added cast to ACE_CDR::Boolean of return values where necessary in
          extraction methods, similarly to what is already in insertion
          methods. Thanks to Ted Mules <ned@technisyst.com.au> for the
          resulting warnings on MSVC at warning level 4. This closes
          [BUGID:1632].

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Removed STDERR from print statements for new checks.  They
          didn't work well and got the messages out of order.  Thanks to
          Bala for motivating this.

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added extra line feed to the file checks to make them more
          readable.  Fixed synch check to only pick up Synch.h and
          Synch_T.h.

Sun Nov  9 00:25:57 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/QoS/QoS_Session_Impl.cpp: Add include of OS_NS_arpa_inet.h
          to unbreak build.

Sat Nov  8 20:54:53 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added the following new fuzz checks:

          check_for_dependency_file:  Checks to see if the Makefile uses
          the DEPENDENCY_FILE variable.  If it does, check to see if the
          dependency file is in cvs.  If not, flag it as an error, since
          the realclean target needs the dependencies to properly
          function.

          check_for_streams_include: Checks to see if ace/streams.h has
          been included since this is an expensive and often unneeded file.

          check_for_OS_h_include: Checks to see if ace/OS.h has been
          included.  This files is maintained for backward
          compatibility but should not be included within ACE+TAO since
          it is expensive and often unneeded--include the OS_NS*.h files
          instead.

          check_for_synch_include: Checks to see if ace/Synch.h or
          ace/Synch_T.h have been included.  These files are maintained
          for backward compatibility but should not be included within
          ACE+TAO since they are expensive and often unneeded--include
          the specific synch file instead, e.g., ace/Null_Mutex.h.

          Added the *.mpc and *.mwc files to the check_for_id_string
          test.

Sat Nov  8 04:52:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * apps/soreduce/Library.h:
          Added #include streams.h

Sat Nov  8 04:11:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_main.h
        * ace/OS_main.cpp:
          Fixed last checkin on Windows and WINCE.  This involved adding a
          pure virtual method and implementing it in a derived class in
          the macro and having it call the users entry point on Windows.
          Otherwise the ACE dll complained about unresolved externals when
          linking.

Fri Nov  7 23:29:02 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_main.h
        * ace/OS_main.cpp:
          Added class to get around problems on Windows.  This is a
          first cut.  If it works out, I'll clean it up.

2003-11-07  Emre Turkay  <turkaye@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:
          Added QT_DLL definition.

Fri Nov  7 21:09:01 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp:
        * ace/OS_main.h
        * ace/OS_main.cpp:
          Added new file, OS_main.cpp, and restructured the "main" macros
          to call real functions the now live in OS_main.cpp.  Added
          OS_main.cpp to the makefiles and OS.cpp.

Fri Nov  7 15:21:49 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Connector.cpp: Added #include "ace/os_include/os_fcntl.h" to

          see ACE_Guard.

        * ACEXML/tests/HttpCharStream_Test.cpp:
          Added #include "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" to get ACE_OS::printf().

Fri Nov  7 11:21:57 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:

          Fixed a typo in the comments.

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.i:
          Use ACE_reinterpret_cast instead of a raw "C" style cast.  Gets
          rid of a warning on HPUX.

Fri Nov  7 00:51:59 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
          Added #ifdef around IPV6 specific code to remove errors on
          platforms where AV_INET6 is not defined.  Changed and instance
          of ACE_OS_String to ACE_OS.

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Added #ifdef around IPV6 specific code to remove errors on
          platforms where AV_INET6 is not defined.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_resource.h:
          Added #includes of sys/syscall.h and sys/systemino.h if
          ACE_HAS_SYSCALL_H and ACE_HAS_SYSINFO are defined respectively.
          This should clear up errors on HPUX.

        * examples/IOStream/server/iostream_server.cpp:
          Added #include of Signal.h.

Thu Nov  6 17:04:22 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set_address):

          Applied patches from Bryan Buesker which basically just changes
          the semantics of ACE_INET_Addr::set_address when map is set to
          1. Previously, if map was non-zero, len was 4, and the  type was
          already set to AF_INET for the ACE_INET_Addr, then the address
          would not be set to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. It is probably
          more desirable for the map argument to force the  address to be
          an IPv4  mapped IPv6 address in this case (regardless of the
          current type of  the address).

Thu Nov  6 17:57:10 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_Log_Msg_Attributes.h:
        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          Moved #include config-all.h outside header guard to avoid circular
          include problem due to including OS_main.h in config-all.h on
          Windows.

          ACE_OS_Export to ACE_Export.

Thu Nov  6 17:53:35 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.{h,i} (set_addr):
          Removed the default parameter for map and added back the
          original set_addr method that matches the one in ACE_Addr, and
          have it call the new method with the default value under the
          covers. This silences warnings about hidden methods.

        * ACEXML/common/HttpCharStream.h:
        * apps/soreduce/Library.h:
          Removed #include of streams.h.

        * ace/ACE_export.h:
          Moved the #include of config-all.h up and outside the
          ACE_EXPORT_H include guard to avoid circular include problems on
          Windows caused by including OS_main.h in config-all.h to pick up
          the main macros.  OS_main.h includes Object_Manager.h.

Thu Nov  6 10:12:50 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:

          Added patch from Bryan Bruesker to use ACE_OS::if_nametoindex ()
          instead of plain if_nametoindex ().

Thu Nov  6 09:50:34 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

          build static libraries.

Thu Nov  6 12:46:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/RMCast/RMCast.rc:

          Andrew L. Shwaika <als@solvo.ru> for supplying this.

Thu Nov  6 10:20:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Thu Nov  6 07:57:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Static_Object_Lock.h:

Thu Nov  6 07:31:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp:

Thu Nov  6 04:53:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl:
          Removed ACE_OS from strerror call in an HP #ifdef that I had
          erroneously added during subsetting--it was obviously like that
          for a reason...

        * ace/OS_TLI.h:
          Add #include of os_tcp.h before #include of sys/xti.h if
          ACE_HAS_BROKEN_XTI_MACROS is defined.  This error arose due to
          the different order of includes after subsetting.

        * ace/SString.h:
          Changed #include streams.h to iosfwd.h.  Due to the change in
          the order of includes, we are now getting errors on SuSE due to
          ceil and floor already being declared.  This is not a final fix,
          but is necessary to keep the stats builds running.

Wed Nov  5 19:02:51 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (clone_from):

          Fixed an alignment problem under the following conditions

          - The incoming CDR buffer has a message of size exactly 1024
            bytes.

          - The data block within the message block in the destination CDR
            is not aligned on an 8 byte boundary.

          This lead to improper copying. The problem was that the call
          clone () on the source data block returned exactly 1024 bytes
          and in addition could potentially (which is the destination)
          could be aligned on a 4 byte boundary. This made the destination
          buffer to get aligned on a 8 byte boundary and lose 4 bytes of
          space which lead to improper copying of the source
          buffer. Thanks to Jian Chen  <jchen@huawei.com> for reporting
          the problem.

          The above problem now been fixed by doing an additional size
          increment on the cloned datablock. We have also added a small
          optimization. We don't always clone the data block. We do it only
          if the size of the source buffer is larger than the size of the
          destination buffer. This should lead to a small increase in
          performance since we are avoiding an allocation along the
          critical path.

          I haven't received a response yet from Jian on whether this
          patch solves his problem. But I am positive that this would
          help.

Wed Nov  5 18:52:01 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          Age C++ can see the whole ACE_Timer_Queue type for template reasons.

        * ace/Timer_Queue.h: Add #include of either
          ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h or ace/Null_Mutex.h based on
          ACE_HAS_THREADS. IBM Visual Age C++ needs to see the complete
          type.

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
          Added #include of OS_NS_poll.h if ACE_HAS_POLL and

          ACE_HAS_IPV6 isn't defined to get rid of warning.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Changed #ifdef to include Object_Manager_Base.h if ACE_MT_SAFE
          != 0 (instead of == 0) instead of Object_Manger.h.

        * ace/Object_Manager.h:
        * ace/Static_Object_Lock.h:
          Added new file, Static_Object_Lock.h, and moved
          ACE_Static_Object_Lock.h there to help reduce need to include
          Object_Manger.h.

        * ace/Reactor.cpp:
          Made #includes of Reactor implementations conditional on usage.
          Removed #include of Reactor_Impl.h and Handle_Set.h
          (Handle_Set.h isn't needed and Reactor_Impl.h doesn't need to be
          read again).  Include Static_Object_Lock.h instead of

Wed Nov  5 14:53:19 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.{h,cpp}:
          Removed some "/**/" comments from normal #include statements so
          these includes can be picked up by doxygen.  This is a doxygen
          "feature" that excludes includes from documentation that have an

          Changed my solution for the explicit std:: namespace I made this
          morning. Making ACE_STD_NAMESPACE dependent of
          ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB breaks other compilers, so
          introduced the new define ACE_USES_EXPLICIT_STD_NAMESPACE which
          defines how ACE_STD_NAMESPACE is expanded. Set this define in the
          Borland config file only.

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Name_Space.h:
          Fixed fuzz errors

Wed Nov  5 07:46:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ARGV.h:
          Define a private copy constructor and assignment operator. The
          compiler generated versions will not work correctly so prevent
          copying of an instance.

        * config-win32.h:
          Moved the check for __BORLANDC__ above the check for _MSC_VER. The
          preview Borland compilers defines both, but we must include in that
          case the Borland config file.

        * Connector.{h,cpp}:
          Moved include of Handle_Set.h from cpp to h file. We really need
          it in the header file.

        * config-all.h:
          Because ACE_OS is now a namespace we encountered a problem with the
          Borland compilers. In ACE_OS::fclose() we did call ::fclose() but
          the Borland compiler now gives an ambiguity between ACE_OS::fclose()
          and std::fclose(). To fix this we added ACE_STD_NAMESPACE which
          is set to std when ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB is defined
          to 1. In other cases we let ACE_STD_NAMESPACE be nothing. In
          ACE_OS::fclose() we program now ACE_STD_NAMESPACE::fclose() so that
          when using Borland this expands to std::fclose(), in other cases to
          ::fclose().

        * OS_NS_time.inl:

          Use ACE_STD_NAMESPACE for the method which appear in ACE_OS and std

Wed Nov  5 05:33:44 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ACEXML/common/FileCharStream.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_wchar.h when ACE_USES_WCHAR is defined.

          to continue to compile even though the header refactoring has
          eliminated the old empty headers.

Tue Nov  4 16:03:06 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.am (HEADER_FILES):

          ACE_LACKS_ITOW, ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_WCSTOK, and ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER,
          needed when ACE_HAS_WCHAR is defined.

Tue Nov  4 09:50:47 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          Include "ace/os_include/os_errno.h".  The ACE_OSCALL macros used
          in these files use the global errno variable.

        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h:

          Don't define ACE_HAS_MUTEX_TIMEOUTS if it has been previously
          defined.  Fixes a warning for configurations that explicitly
          define ACE_HAS_MUTEX_TIMEOUTS.

          Do not directly check the GNU libc-specific "__USE_XOPEN2K"
          XPG6 feature test macro.  The correct/portable way to check for
          XPG6 features is to check if _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600.

Tue Nov  4 06:20:18 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6ProjectCreator.pm:

          Remove an unnecessary intermediate variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7dll.mpt:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7lib.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7libexe.mpt:

          Split static projects from dynamic projects ala VC6.  When one VC7
          static library project depends on another, they are linked
          together as the second one is built.  This causes the contents of
          each library to grow tremendously.  Splitting the projects allows
          us to omit the project dependencies for static libraries.

Tue Nov  4 01:03:56 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (AC_PREREQ):

          Fixed typo in copyright statement.

          Bumped autoconf prerequisite to version 2.57g.  Function tests
          in versions prior to that did not function properly on HP-UX.

          (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR):

          Call this Autoconf macro with an "aux" argument.  This causes
          all autotool related scripts to be placed in to the `aux'
          directory.  Addresses a problem with some versions of libtoolize
          where an empty auxiliary directory name is assumed instead of
          the well defined defaults.  This change also happens to remove
          some of the clutter in the top-level directory.

          (AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR):

          Call this Autoconf macro with a "m4" argument to inform
          autotools that recognize this macro where the ACE Autconf/M4
          macros are located.

        * bin/bootstrap:

          Replaced manual calls to aclocal, autoheader, autoconf, automake
          and libtoolize with a single call to `autoreconf'.  The latter
          is a bit smarter about bootstrapping autoconfiscated
          workspaces, and also allows us to simplify this bootstrap
          script.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Started converting all Bourne shell "if" blocks to Autoconf
          "AS_IF" blocks.  The latter provides improved portability.

        * m4/acinclude.m4:
        * m4/compiler.m4:
        * m4/features.m4:
        * m4/subsets.m4:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

        * m4/config_h.m4 (AH_TOP):

          Removed "-*- C++ -*-" Emacs mode comment.  It had no effect
          since it wasn't in the first few lines of the generated
          `config.h' file.

          (AH_BOTTOM):

          Define Emacs mode at the bottom of the generated `config.h' file
          using the canonical Emacs "Local Variables" block.  The
          generated `config.h' file is now correctly interpreted as a C++
          header when opened in Emacs.


        * m4/threads.m4:

          Started converting all Bourne shell "if" blocks to Autoconf
          "AS_IF" blocks.  The latter provides improved portability.

          Refactored common POSIX threads detection code to an autoconf
          macro.

          Replaced brittle POSIX thread code that checked for backward
          compatibility macros.  Use a run/link-time test instead.  This
          allows us to avoid determining what the real pthread_create()
          function is called.  This should fix a Pthread detection problem
          that occurred on HP-UX.

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Updated source lists with latest set of source filenames.

        * apps/gperf/mdate-sh:
        * apps/gperf/texinfo.tex:

          Removed these files.  They are automatically added when
          bootstrapping an "autoconfiscated" workspace.

Wed Nov  4 08:34:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp: (getmacaddress)
          Always do an reinterpret_cast because the static_cast also doesn't
          work when ansi casts is enabled. Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edanayal@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Wed Nov  4 08:18:37 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_signal.h:
          Removed include of OS_export and changed ACE_OS_Export to
          ACE_Export to fix compile errors.

Wed Nov  4 06:15:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Nov  3 22:11:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h: Added a note about SunCC 5.0.

Mon Nov  3 20:35:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION, since
          CC 5.3 seems to be doing the right thing for class member
          specializations. We will soon check things out on other
          compilers.

Mon Nov  3 19:38:45 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-all.h:

          Added a new #define, ACE_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION
          which defines template <>  for definitions of member functions
          of a class that is specialized.

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION, since
          g++ is doing the right thing for class member specializations.

Mon Nov  3 17:02:42 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
        * ace/config-macosx.h:

          defined.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_msg.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_shm.inl:
          Added #include of OS_NS_errno.h:

Mon Nov  3 16:43:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl:
          Added missing #includes needed on HPUX due to recent
          subsetting.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
          Changed #ifdef around ACE_OS::timezone implementation to be just
          __GNUG__ since it seems to be needed on all OS's that use g++.

        * ace/OS_NS_string.h:
          Changed ACE_OS_Export to ACE_Export.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Added #include of sys/pstat.h needed on HPUX.

        * ace/os_include/os_termios.h:
          Added #include of sys/modem.h on HPUX to pickup the MDTR
          definition.

Mon Nov  3 10:19:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
          Updated this file with all recent changes

Mon Nov  3 08:24:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_TERMIOS_H

Mon Nov  3 06:41:16 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.h:
          Added missing ACE_Export to printf() declaration.

Mon Nov  3 06:09:08 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/MM_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp:
        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Scatter_Gather_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SPIPE_Test.cpp:
          Added #includes needed on Windows due to recent
          subsetting.

Mon Nov  3 05:02:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp:
          Added missing #ifdef ACE_MT_SAFE around
          ACE_OS::netdb_{acquire|release} method implementations.  This
          fixes single threaded build errors on platforms that define
          ACE_LACKS_NETDB_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS.

Mon Nov  3 04:43:43 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Makefile:
        * bin/reverseclean:
          Pass the $(MAKE) variable to the reverseclean script and use it
          instead of "make".  This fixes problems in autobuilds that
          assign something other than "make" to the make_program
          variable.

Mon Nov  3 04:12:12 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_freebsd.GNU:
          Overhaul the OS version tests so that they actually work.
          The "-pthread" gcc flag was recently deprecated in FreeBSD's gcc, so
          use the correct pthread flags for gcc, based on the OS version.
          Inspired by similar tests in /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk

Mon Nov  3 03:04:48 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Barrier.h:
        * ace/Managed_Object.h:
        * ace/Object_Manager.h:
        * tests/Priority_Reactor_Test.cpp:
          Added #include needed when not inlining due to recent
          subsetting.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Added #ifdef ACE_MT_SAFE around ACE_OS_Thread_Mutex_Guard
          implementation.

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.h:
          Removed ACE_OS friend statements and redundant method
          declarations (which were problematic on Windows).

        * ace/Token.cpp:
          Moved #include of Token.i outside of ACE_HAS_THREADS #ifdef
          since ACE_Noop_Token is there and required in single threaded
          builds.

Sun Nov  2 15:58:23 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Added a comment about footprint and compile times, and moved the
          commented out files up--MPC doesn't like comments in file
          lists.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.inl:
          Fixed a couple of instances of ::memcpy that didn't include
          ACE_OS.

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp:
          Added #include Object_Manager_Base.h.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Added #include Object_Manager_Base.h and OS_NS_Thread.h.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp:
          Added #include of OS_NS_Thread.h needed when

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp:
          Fixed typo.

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h:
          Fixed typo.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
          for reporting this.

Sat Nov  1 23:45:49 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/ACE_export.h:
          Added ACE_NAMESPACE_INLINE_FUNCTION and ACE_NAMESPACE_STORAGE_CLASS
          macros to help control exporting of symbols from namespaces on
          Windows.

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Added defines to specify that MinGW lacks certain header files.
          Because of the rework this was now found.

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Reordered new files to make them easer to verify.

          changed occurrences of ACE_OS_String and ACE_OS_Dirent to
          ACE_OS; changes u_long, etc., to unsigned long to reduce
          dependencies; reordered includes in *.cpp's to come after the
          inline file include, reducing the difference between inlined and
          non-inlined builds.

        * ace/CLASSIX/CLASSIX_OS.h:
        * ace/CLASSIX/CLASSIX_Port_Core.h:
          Removed #include OS.h from these files, but didn't add new
          headers since it isn't regularly compiled.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserContext.cpp:
          Added template instantiation for ACE_Swap.

Fri Oct 31 14:09:37 2003  Edward R. Mulholland  <emulholl@atl.lmco.com>

        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.h:

          The port numbers of the secondary addresses are now kept in sync
          with the port number of the primary address.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.h:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.h:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.h:
        * ace/OS.h:

          The PEER_ADDR typedefs have been changed from ACE_INET_Addr to
          ACE_Multihomed_INET_Addr.  The "broken templates" section of
          OS.h has been changed accordingly.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.cpp:

          Hostname restrictions are now preserved during wildcard bind
          operations.

Fri Oct 31 07:50:48 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dynamicinterface.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/iorinterceptor.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/messaging.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/objreftemplate.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/valuetype.mpb:

          The dependencies were not right. For long the weak links between
          libraries allowed us to get away without proper
          dependencies. With the refactoring the dependencies got explicit
          and we need the dependencies set right.

Fri Oct 31 07:38:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Allow a user to set the sharedname to empty to force only static
          builds.  Also, fixed the output directory target such that it will
          be executed before the library is generated.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/automake.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/va4icc.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Allow these templates to work properly if the sharedname is set to
          empty.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7dll.mpt:

          Partially fixed a bug with static libraries.  The wrong
          configuration type and library tool was being used.  A correct
          implementation of the vc7 type would involve splitting the static
          build targets from the dynamic into separate projects.

Thu Oct 30 16:14:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (spawn_i):

          Fixed ACE_Thread_Manager problem on VxWorks where thread id
          could be corrupted by taking address of a temporary
          variable. Thank to Dennis Noll, and Brian Mendel for tracking
          this down.

Thu Oct 30 11:57:36 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added a couple of Portable_Interceptor
          tests to the daily builds.

Thu Oct 30 09:33:15 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Allow the GENFLAGS value to be overridden by MPC when the makefiles
          are being generated.

Thu Oct 30 14:24:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.mpc:
          Corrected dynamicflags

Thu Oct 30 07:48:29 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:

          Removed the double quotes around E.idl, since this caused problems
          with the VC71 projects and wasn't necessary anyway.

Thu Oct 30 06:35:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Fixed a reference of libflag that should have been staticflag.

Wed Oct 29 14:06:45 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.{h,i}: Added default constructor for
          ConfigInfo, which puts in default values.

Wed Oct 29 12:02:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/automake.mpd: Change the
          minimum required automake version to 1.7 and added some
          further header comments.

Wed Oct 29 07:03:12 2003  UTC Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added a rule so that files with extension .rc are compiled with
          COMPILE.rc which is then the RC. By setting then RC to the
          resource compiler in the specific GNU file resource files are
          compiled.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added COMPILE.rc rule that uses the new RC to make it easy to set the
          resource compiler needed.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Set RC to windres. Cygwin and MinGW have a resource compiler and then
          put version info into the DLL.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Generate the resource files into the makefile and when RC is set add
          those files to FILES so that the resource files are compiled.

          Thanks to Andrew L. Shwaika <als@solvo.ru> for pointing us at the
          possibility to use a resource compiler with MinGW.

Tue Oct 28 17:07:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Makefile.am: Added definition of ACLOCAL so autoconf stuff gets
          rebuilt correctly when needed.

Tue Oct 28 16:33:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/ace.m4: Added new option, --enable-stdcpplib, defaults to yes.
          This enables (disables) use of the standard C++ library on platforms
          where it makes a difference, like HP-UX aC++.

        * m4/compiler.m4: For HP aC++, add -Ae (c89 mode) to CFLAGS.
          When using --enable-stdcpplib=yes with aC++, add -AA to CXXFLAGS.

Tue Oct 28 07:52:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added GNU variable pipes. When this is not set, it defaults to 0.
          When it is 1, it results in adding -pipe to the CFLAGS.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Only set pipes to 1, the new code in wrapper_macros.GNU will add
          the needed compiler flag

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          When running the Tornado compiler on Win32 we can use pipes, so
          when pipes is not set, set it to 1. Also don't add the compiler
          flag anymore, this is done in wrapper_macros.GNU

Mon Oct 27 16:00:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACEXML/common/ZipCharStream.cpp: Silence HP aC++ warnings about
          an empty translation unit.

Mon Oct 27 15:51:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/acinclude.m4: Remove \ from \-quoted double- and back-quote
          characters to obey warnings from autoheader 2.57g. autoheader's
          processing of these warnings was erroneous, causing it to fail.

Mon Oct 27 19:48:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
          For reverseclean don't use the reverse_clean perl script but do
          a realclean in reverse order. This fixes the problem we have in the
          Sun Forte build where the list of arguments to the perl script is
          to long.

Mon Oct 27 11:17:03 2003  Gautam Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * SOCK_SEQPACK_clt.cpp:
          Fixed a previously made change that was using sizes for tests as
          n**2 rather than 2**n!
          SOCK_STREAM_clt.cpp:
          Fixed a previously made change that was using sizes for tests as
          n**2 rather than 2**n!

Sat Oct 25 10:51:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Fixed compile problem in this file

Fri Oct 17 18:40:55 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Modify the ACE_Log_Msg::dec() method to avoid
          "going negative."  Thanks to Matthieu Vansteene
          <matthieu.vansteene@regis-dgac.net> for reporting this.

Thu Oct 23 17:14:47 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Fixed a problem whereby ACE_IOV_MAX
          should have been 16 for Win 95/98/me.  Thanks to Enrico Detoma
          <enrico.detoma@email.it> for reporting this.

Fri Oct 24 11:27:52 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.3.5 released.

Fri Oct 24 10:48:41 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Changed documentation to reflect the fact that
          $ACE_ROOT/lib also has to added LD_LIBRARY_PATH since some of
          the libraries are generated in this directory.

Fri Oct 24 10:46:56 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile: Added lib to the release files.

Wed Oct 22 11:14:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/tests/Counter64_Test.cpp:
          Added define ULLONG on Win32 to fix compile error with MinGW.

Tue Oct 21 11:00:51 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp (notify): Release memory from the
          Event_Handler_var after adding messages to the notify queue
          without adding any messages to the pipe. Thanks to the daily
          builds for catching this.

Mon Oct 20 13:31:36 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Remove the dependency on the pch generated file from the object
          target.  It is unnecessary and causes problems with the /YX
          option.

Mon Oct 20 16:38:12 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:
          Don't exclude *.exp when linking since these are the expected
          result files for apps/gperf/tests.

        * tests/New_Fail_Test:
          Added #ifdef around unused code to remove warnings>

        * ace/Auto_Event.cpp:
        * ace/Event.cpp:

        * ace/RW_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/RW_Thread_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.cpp:
          Added #include of the associated headers that were missing.
          This will be needed once these files are compiled separately via
          MPC.  Thanks to Barry Benowitz <b.benowitz@telesciences.com> for
          motivating this.

Sun Oct 19 21:25:59 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/hist.cpp: Fixed fuzz errors. Include
          "ace/os_include/os_math.h" instead of math.h.

Sun Oct 19 21:16:44 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

          Bala for pointing this out.

Fri Oct 17 16:21:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Only set SONAME if
          platform_macros.GNU didn't.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU: Conditionalize
          addition of SONAME to SOFLAGS based on versioned_so, not on
          SONAME's content. However, even with versioned_so, don't try to
          add SOFLAGS stuff if with_ld is openbsd - it doesn't support it.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU: Set versioned_so
          to 0 by default to avoid shared lib version tagging rather
          than set SONAME to blank.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openbsd.GNU: Set with_ld to openbsd
          to tell platform_g++_common.GNU not to add the ldname options
          even if versioned_so is enabled.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Add shared lib
          option to SOFLAGS if versioned_so is 1. Set versioned_so to 1
          by default.

Fri Oct 17 06:48:15 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.h:
          When using the new CBX preview compiler define ACE_NSIG as _NSIG

Thu Oct 16 21:18:06 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/kokyu_dsrt_schedulers.mpb:
          Added rtscheduling as a base project. This should take care of
          link problems in cygwin build.

Thu Oct 16 18:08:01 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          Reverted my change below, when I committed it, I realized it
          is not the correct place

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_PTRDIFF_T and ACE_PTRDIFF_T_TYPE to get the
          ptrdiff_t out of the std namespace.

Thu Oct 16 17:56:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          When using the new Borland compiler from CBuilderX get
          ptrdiff_t out of the std namespace. This fixes hundreds
          of compile errors in our CBX Preview build.

Thu Oct 16 15:36:22 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm: For testing using Pocket Controller,
          use "start/wait" instead of running the command and sleeping. Gets
          the tests run quicker and more reliably. Requires Pocket Controller
          Enterprise V4.01 or higher.

Thu Oct 16 09:03:11 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed another problem with * in the after keyword.  Multiple
          listings with * would only pick up the first one.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          If install is set to . for exe's then don't do anything.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support for setting ar flags and setting cpp flags on the
          make command line.

Thu Oct 16 09:02:24 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:

          Escape regular expression special characters from strings
          before they are used as regular expressions.

Thu Oct 16 08:37:54 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * apps/gperf/tests/tests.mpc:

          Fixed a bug with dependencies and parallelism between building the
          test and running the test.

Wed Oct 15 13:40:02 2003  Huang-Ming Huang <hh1@cse.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrtevent.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrteventclient.mpb
          Added for fault tolerant event service.

Wed Oct 15 18:28:02 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/net/os_if.h:
          Added #undef of IOR on HP-UX.  IOR is used in TAO.  Thanks to
          Torsten Kopper <tkue_0931@fastmail.fm> for this patch.

Wed Oct 15 12:10:39 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Updated the documentation to make it
          clear that setenv is a TCSH/CSHism.  Thanks to David McKen
          <cic_3_b@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Wed Oct 15 13:22:32 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU:
          Also set versioned_so to 0 in this file.

Wed Oct 15 13:16:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:
          Instead of setting SONAME and SOVERSION to empty, set
          versioned_so to 0 to indicate that versioned dll's should
          be used because cygwin and mingw have problem with this.
          This makes Cygwin/MinGW working again.

Wed Oct 15 08:45:20 EDT 2003  Kevin Bryank <bryank@cs.uri.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcosscheduling.mpb:
          Adding base project for using the RTC 1.0 Scheduling Service

Wed Oct 15 10:40:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          Fixed unused argument warning when ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE
          is defined

Tue Oct 14 21:54:07 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CIAO_CORE_DIRS): Added Kokyu to the list of base
          library for CIAO.  Although CIAO doesn't depend on Kokyu, it is
          needed to allow the compilation in orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ to run to
          completion.

Tue Oct 14 23:21:00 UTC 2003  Don Hinton <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Removed following method declarations that were not implemented
          or used: times(), cond_timedwait_i(), alarm_i(), ualarm_i(),
          sleep_i(), nanosleep_i(), select_i(), poll_i(), sema_wait_i(),
          sigtimedwait_i(), gettimeofday_i().

        * ace/Process.h:
          Fixed typo and added #include of Global_Macros.h.

Tue Oct 14 17:13:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process.h: Put the ACE_Process copy constructor and
          assignment operator in the private part of the class to disallow
          copying.  Thanks to Adam Fanello <yahoo@fanello.net> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/OS.cpp: Added patches to support PHARLAP.  Thanks
          to Ira Burton <imburton@micron.com> for supplying these.

Tue Oct 14 13:54:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
        Picked up from ACE 5.3:
        Wed Jun 11 17:18:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Make SOVERSION
          user-settable if versioned_so is enabled. Thanks to Craig L.
          Ching <cching@mqsoftware.com> for this idea.
          Also moved the versioned_so and SOVERSION setup to after
          platform_macros.GNU is included so that users can set this stuff
          up in their platform_macros.GNU file. The ACE_MAJOR_VERSION,
          etc. variables are still set up before platform_macros.GNU, though,
          in case platform_macros.GNU wants to use them.

Sun Oct 12 17:34:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Removed mentioning of tests/run_tests.bat, it has been removed
          some time ago and the perl script run_tests.pl is the only one
          to use. Updated documentation for Borland support. CBuilderX is
          now supported, but not the new preview compiler that is shipped
          with CBuilderX.

        * Kokyu/Default_Dispatcher_Impl.cpp:

          Added allocator, sched scope, sched policy, reordering queue
          attributes to the Dispatcher_Attributes class. This will make

        * Kokyu/tests/EDF/test.cpp:

          Added command line options to specify the sched policy.

Fri Oct 10 19:52:26 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.{h,i}:
          On some platforms clearerr is a macro. Because of this,
          the name ACE_OS::clearerr will cause errors. So in order
          to use the macro as it is defined but also keep the name
          ACE_OS::clearerr, clearerr macro is used in inline function,
          and then undefined.  This patch fixes the "fixes" committed by
          Wed Sep 24 08:57:36 2003  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> and Tue Apr 15 16:06:24 2003  Douglas
          C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>.  Thanks to Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for submitting the patch and Bala for motivation me
          to apply it...

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          Instead of obj use $(OBJEXT) and instead of lib use $(LIBEXT) to
          handle the new extensions for the CBX Preview compiler.

Fri Oct 10 08:14:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          Added some support for the new CBuilderX preview compiler. This has
          a different name and different options to be used. When defining CBX
          as environment variable this new compiler is used, else we just use
          the normal compiler.

Thu Oct 09 12:43:51 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtscheduling.mpb (after): The
          after directive should have the name of the project and not the
          name of the directory.  This should solve the problem of
          RTScheduling tests making before the RTScheduler library has
          been built.

Wed Oct 08 21:43:30 2003  Huang-Ming Huang  <hh1@cse.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          When using Kylix use a different $(BIN) rule. This will fix a lot
          of the errors we have in the Kylix build.

        * ace/Reactor.h: Renamed a variable name, signals to sigset. The
          former was creating problems when Reactor is used with
          Qt. Thanks to Hans Utz <hans.utz@informatik.uni-ulm.de> for
          reporting the problem.

        * Makefile: Added Kokyu to the list of controlled files. Thanks to
          Don Hinton for the patch and Werner Buchert for reporting the
          problem.

          supports these.

Tue Oct 07 06:07:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Define ACE_HAS_SSIZE_T when building with MinGW version 3 or later

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.h:
        * Connection/blocking/test_spipe_acceptor.cpp:
          This example uses AsynchIO, check for this when compiling and when
          this is not available then just build a main saying this isn't
          available. This fixes build problems in the Cygwin build.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Generate NAME, else nothing happens when building with Borland.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          Also remove underscores that are followed by spaces.  The value
          could be a space separated list and removing the trailing
          underscore isn't enough.

Thu Oct  2 13:02:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          When generating project names from '*' remove trailing

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7dll.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7exe.mpt:

          When building release targets set optimize equal to 3 (full
          optimization).

Wed Oct  1 07:20:31 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/depgen.pl:

        * apps/drwho/drwho.mpc:
        * apps/drwho/nobuild.mpb:

          Added verbatim (in nobuild.mpb) to stop the drwho application from
          building on VxWorks, Chorus, minbw32 and cygwin32.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added a new marker to support the above change.

          targets (such as idl files) that may generate source code.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Commented out shift for $self since it isn't used.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed arbitrary restriction upon duplicate project names.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Support versions of make other than GNU and added support for
          Tru64, LynxOS, MacOS, Unixware and QNX.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:
        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Modified the dependency generator to be smarter about processing
          include files.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          By default use g++dep for dependency generation, but allow an
          alternate by setting the DEPGEN make macro.

Thu Sep 25 09:28:47 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Misc/childbirth_time.cpp (prof_ace_os_thread): Replaced
          NULL with 0 to ensure the code compiles on LynxOS.  Thanks to
          Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for reporting this.

        * ace/Pipe.cpp (open): Swapped the order of the SO_RCVBUF and
          SO_SNDBUF socket option calls so that the reader sets the RCVBUF
          and the writer sets the SNDBUF.  Thanks to Tomer Amiaz
          <tomer@BANDWIZ.COM> for reporting this.

Wed Sep 24 15:29:25 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/QtReactor.cpp: Fixed a silly mistake caused by a
          comment being too close to a '*' character!  Thanks to Serge
          Kolgan <skolgan@trigraph.com> for reporting this.

Wed Sep 24 12:36:21 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

Wed Sep 24 08:57:36 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl: Fixed incorrect usage message. This fixes
          [BUG 1588]. Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan for the patches.

        * ace/OS.h: Fixed definition of macro clearerr to it's original
          value. Thanks to  Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for providing the
          patches to get it compiling on LynxOS.

Mon Sep 22 23:10:51 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Bug_1576_Regression_Test.dsp:
        * tests/tests.dsw:

          Added missing MSVC++ 6 project file for Bug_1576_Regression_Test
          test.  Fixes failures in Windows builds due to missing project
          file.

Mon Sep 22 11:36:26 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/SString.cpp:

          Added __Lynx__ to the special check for instantiating
          ACE_String_Base<char>::NULL_String_.

Mon Sep 22 11:04:03 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portablegroup.mpb:

          Use comps and tagchecks instead of requires for 'PortableGroup'.

Mon Sep 22 10:16:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README:

          Added a table providing additional clarifications about
          different implementations of SCTP under Linux and its
          implications with respect to ACE Wrapper facades supported.

Thu Sep 18 10:55:58 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Removed the S.cpp from the specialized idl file rules to avoid yet
          another parallel build problem.

Thu Sep 18 08:34:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-all.h:

          Corrected a misspelling of ace in a #include.

Tue Sep 16 13:19:42 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Set the TEMPINCDIR to a subdirectory under the original TEMPINCDIR
          value.  This will happen only if TEMPINCDIR is defined (for AIX).

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix4_cset++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:

          Set the template include directory via the -qtempinc=<directory>
          option instead of using the default (tempinc).

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Use $(TEMPINCDIR) instead of tempinc.

Tue Sep 16 11:55:18 2003  Gautam H. Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/SOCK_SEQPACK_srv.cpp:

          fix compiler warning due to unintialized pointer

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.LKSCTP

          update README to indicate new LKSCTP API support.

          Changes to support changed LKSCTP API support from 2.6.test.4
          kernel an onward.

Tue Sep 16 10:28:02 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Escape the file name that's used as a regular expression.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Add implicit project dependencies when using the -hierarchy
          option.

Mon Sep 15 13:22:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added some optimizations to the circular dependency tree
          generation code.

Mon Sep 15 06:42:28 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a check in the dependency sorter for an undefined dependency
          value (this only happened with the vc7 and vc71 types).

Fri Sep 12 13:31:50 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Updated the code to detect and drop circular dependencies.  The
          original code was wrong and would drop dependencies that didn't
          need to be.

Fri Sep 12 11:51:17 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.dsp:

          Fixed setting for release configuration.

Fri Sep 12 11:38:57 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Test_Output.dsp:

          Fixed settings for the release configuration.

Fri Sep 12 11:36:17 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Modified the AIX compiler support to be a rule, instead of
          modifying $(COMPILE.cc), that will be run before building the all
          target.

Fri Sep 12 10:56:02 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.dsp:

Thu Sep 11 12:37:05 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Second anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks on
          the USA.  Let us pray that clear heads will prevail in the
          prevention of future conflicts.

Thu Sep 11 06:39:23 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug with the automatic project dependencies that was
          related to directories and the location that mwc.pl was run.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added support for poor AIX compilers that don't deal with
          templates correctly.  This was basically a cut and paste into the
          template from the original ACE_wrappers/tests/Makefile.

Wed Sep 10 13:26:14 MST 2003 Trevor Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh:

          Changed the path to mogrify. It uses /usr/bin/X11/bin path if it is
          not present in the /usr/local/bin

Wed Sep 10 11:48:31 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Allow files with spaces to be processed correctly.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Added support for files with spaces (vc7 already supported them).

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Fixed a warning about the /Ob option.

Wed Sep 10 10:21:16 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Use tagchecks even if comps is used.

Wed Sep 10 08:04:25 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added automatic parallel dependencies.  If more than one project
          in the same directory contains shared source files, then the
          projects will become dependent upon each other.  This will help
          avoid files (both generated source and object) being overwritten
          by multiple instances of make.  This only has an effect on the
          GNUACE workspaces.

Tue Sep  9 15:04:51 MST 2003 Trevor Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Web_Crawler/Mem_Map_Stream.h:

Mon Sep  8 07:04:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added support to the 'after' keyword to use the '*' mechanism as
          can be used in the project() definition.

Fri Sep  5 13:39:07 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/client.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/server.mpb:

          I realized that many more mpc projects use client and server.
          They should be converted to use taoserver and taoclient, but until
          that happens I will put these back.

          Updated these base projects with the correct comps and requires
          values.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Make all keywords case insensitive (as it should have been).

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          special options or output directories).

Thu Sep  4 16:00:18 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h: Updated the documentation for
          current_size() and total_size() to be more accurate.  Thanks to
          Gerard Grant <ggrant@Foxboro.com> for motivating this.

Thu Sep  4 14:21:33 2003  Gautam H. Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.LKSCTP:
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.OpenSS7:

        Slight update to README files. Made more clear how SCTP
        capable kernel and ACE/TAO are built. Due to recent
        changes in LKSCTP API additional changes will be committed
        in near future as new Linux kernel with the changes is released.

Thu Sep  4 09:56:28 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Modified the GNUACEWorkspaceCreator to generate a workspace that
          will work with the -j option of GNU Make.  Each project in the
          workspace has an individual target with dependencies on the
          necessary targets which allows GNU Make to determine which
          projects can be built in parallel.

Thu Sep  4 09:30:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h: Reverted this change "Wed Sep 3 17:42:00 2003
          Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>". This caused builds to
          break so easily.

Wed Sep 3 17:42:00 2003 Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:

          An empty ACE_ASSERT now uses ACE_UNUSED_ARG. This prevents
          warnings by compilers that aren't smart enough to recognize that
          the code *is* used, but only by the preprocessor.

Wed Sep  3 17:01:02 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          builds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Added a dependency to all source files upon any generated files
          (be it idl or custom build).

Wed Sep  3 09:44:01 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Move the location of the idl_stubs dependency above the include of
          rules.lib.GNU.

Tue Sep 2 18:00:00 2003 Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:
        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.i:

          Removed implementations of copy constructors and assignment
        operators, and made them private. These were not correct, and
        would cause an infinite loop if ever called. I also had to
        comment out several other broken operators that were using the
        copy constructors or assignment operators. In general, someone
        should take a close look at these classes, and either fix all the
        many problems, or remove apparently unnecessary features entirely.

        * test/tests.mpc:

          Added support for the UUID test. This test really doesn't test
        very much right now, as it still passed even though I had removed
        most of the functionality from the uuid classes.

Tue Sep  2 07:02:19 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Updated the documentation on the defaulting behavior of MPC.

Sat Aug 30 12:10:00 2003 Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Changed to continue linking even when some source files can't
        be found. It appears that the perl link() function doesn't work
        correctly on Windows Server 2003. A little investigating shows that
        several other file functions have problems with long path names on
        that os unless you use the Unicode versions. I verified this with a
        simple c++ program, that tried to use _fullpath() and CreateHardLink().
        Currently the only problems are in the Notify service performance tests,
        because these have extremely long path names.

Fri Aug 29 15:18:36 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Blobby/blobby.mpc:
        * apps/soreduce/soreduce.mpc:
          Added exename to both of these to force an exe to be created
          instead of a library.

        * tests/RMCast/acetest.mpb
          Modified the path for Main.cpp so that it picks up the one in
          the current directory.  Some build were having problems with
          this and didn't create the .obj directory which cause
          compilation to fail.

Fri Aug 29 13:41:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Modified the template to avoid including wrapper_macros.GNU more
          than once.  Instead of setting SHLIB_UNCHECKED and then checking
          for the feature and setting SHLIB if it's enabled, I set SHLIB,
          check for the feature and then reset SHLIB if the feature isn't
          enabled.

Fri Aug 29 13:21:01 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Elaborated on a key point of custom definitions.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Empty the ACELIB variable after including wrapper_macros.GNU.
          This is a feature of wrapper_macros.GNU that MPC doesn't need.

Fri Aug 29 08:27:58 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.cpp:
        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.cpp:
        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp: Added explicit template
          instantiations to fix compile errors in
          Solaris_9_Forte7_ACE_(MPC) build. Thanks to Don Hinton for
          pointing this out.

Thu Aug 28 22:29:03 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        From Don Hinton <dhinton@dresystems.com>
        * tests/Bug_1576_Regression_Test.cpp:

          Updated to work in wchar builds.

Thu Aug 28 07:57:33 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Added ERROR: to the output when an unknown option is passed on the
          command line.

Thu Aug 28 07:10:54 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added the reverseclean target as best as it could be supported by
          MPC.

Thu Aug 28 06:33:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/tests/Address_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile error

        * ACEXML/tests/.depend.Makefile.NamespaceSupport_Test:

          Removed these files since they should be generated dynamically
          by the new MPC Makefiles (that will also be generated
          dynamically).

Wed Aug 27 20:34:19 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h: Added export qualification to
          Dispatcher_Attributes class to fix link error in
          Win2K_VC71_NET_DLL build.

Wed Aug 27 17:52:44 2003  George Edwards <g.edwards@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added the following new tests to daily builds:
          TAO/tests/OBV/Collocated/Forward/
          TAO/tests/Portable_Interceptors/Bug_1559/
          TAO/tests/Portable_Interceptors/Collocated/Dynamic/
          TAO/tests/Portable_Interceptors/Collocated/Service_Context_Manipulation/

Wed Aug 27 15:18:49 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU (CCFLAGS):

          Do not add "-Wno-uninitialized" to GNU C++ compiler flags.  It
          is no longer needed to avoid (apparently) bogus warnings.
          Keeping it around hides potentially real problems.

Wed Aug 27 14:23:00 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Reverted the -recurse change from Mon Aug 18 12:28:09 2003.  Added
          a -exclude option that allows users to exclude directories
          independently from the -recurse option.

Wed Aug 27 13:25:20 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h: Added inline qualification to operator != to
          fix warnings in SunOS_SunCC53 build.

Wed Aug 27 17:06:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_cancel.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_udp_proactor.cpp:
          Added a main that is used when these examples are build on a
          platform on which these examples don't work. This fixes the link
          errors in the Cygwin build.

Wed Aug 27 10:32:03 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Added documentation for the new -hierarchy option.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Options.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a -hierarchy option which forces MPC to generate a workspace
          at each directory level between the current directory and the
          directory in which the mpc file is located.

Tue Aug 26 18:57:07 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/ASNMP_Export.h:
          Added new export file to define ASNMP_Export needed on Windows.

          Changed ACE_Export to ASNMP_Export in order to correctly create
          dll's on Windows.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing this out.

        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.h:
          Added #include OS_Memory.h.

Tue Aug 26 16:32:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/RW_Mutex.h:
          Fixed incorrect doxygen file tag

Tue Aug 26 11:22:41 UTC 2003  Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Projects should default to optimization=0. This prevented the
          tao_idl project from compiling.

Tue Aug 26 11:10:45 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:

          Changed the logic of the checks for return value in
          insertion and extraction of bounded (w)strings. If the
          bound_ member value of the helper construct was 0, the
          operator could incorrectly return 0 after a successful
          read or write. Thanks to Tufan Oruk <toruk@usa.net> and
          Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for independently
          reporting problems that are consequences of this bug.

Tue Aug 26 09:55:19 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.{cpp,h,i}: Added operator != for ConfigInfo to
          satisfy RH71_Explicit_Templates build.

Tue Aug 26 09:21:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When checking for the -k option, remove --unix from the MAKEFLAGS
          value.  This helps things work with Cygwin.  Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen for reporting this.

Tue Aug 26 08:37:21 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Sched_Queue_T.h: Changed the prototype of
          Guid_Hash::operator method with full qualification for the
          Guid_t type. This is to fix compile errors in
          SunOS_8_Forte8_Debug build.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.h:
        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h:

Tue Aug 26 08:24:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Set PWD on the make command line when the project makefile isn't
          in the current directory.

        * ASNMP/tests/Address_Test.cpp:
        * ASNMP/tests/Target_Test.cpp:
          Removed unused variables to quash warnings.

        * ASNMP/tests/test_config.h:
          Added #include streams.h and removed old style headers; changed
          use of open() flags to correct type.

          nmake, em3, vc6 and vc71 types.  By default the release targets
          have optimization on and using -value_template optimize=
          allows a user to turn off optimization compiler flags.

        the other feature-based libraries. I removed the hard-coded ssl
        logic from some of the mpd files that still had it. A side-effect
        of the new way, is that you must now define an SSL_ROOT
        environment variable that the openssl.mpb feature will now use to
        locate the openssl libraries.

        There were some problems with the existing vc7.mpd template.  I've
        improved the template, and also added support for lots of new
        settings in the corresponding .mpt files. (Although I haven't used
        them yet.)  I'll probably use this to enable some of the new
        features in vc71 that help track down problems that typically only
        show up in release mode.

        The creation of workspaces for vc71 did not correctly set
        dependencies between projects.

        I added an allow_duplicates() method to the WorkspaceCreator.  A
        warning will always be generated if a workspace contains duplicate
        project names, and now the vc6/7/71 creators will abort creation
        of these invalid workspaces. I suggest that any future
        WorkspaceCreator subclasses that generate IDE projects, override
        allow_duplicates() to return 0.

        Renamed the gperf_exe to gperf. This was named as a special hack
        for vc6 that is now unnecessary. We had already renamed other
        similar projects, but missed this one.

        * ACE.mwc:
          Added CVS Id keyword.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.mpc:
        * netsvcs/servers/servers.mpc:
          Modified project names to keep MSVC happy--it can't deal with
          duplicate names.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Warn about duplicate project names for all project types.  It will
          have to be this way as long as MPC supports VC6.

Tue Aug 19 10:07:47 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * doc/tutorials/015: Added support for compression.  Thanks

          Added missing mwc and mpc files.  Most of the mwc files were
          needed so that running mwc.pl -recurse would create Makefiles in
          directories that contained only subdirectories and no mpc files.

          Added the ability to exclude directories when using the -recurse
          option.  See USAGE or mwc.pl -h for details.

Mon Aug 18 15:22:02 2003  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Changed the TAO/orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo test from SANDBOX to
          !MINIMUM to broaden platform coverage of the IMR testing.

Sun Aug 17 16:35:01 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.i (dump_i):
        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp (dump_i):

          Uninlined this method to avoid adding an inter-header dependency
          on "ace/Log_Msg.h".  Also fixes some explicit template
          instantiation builds.

        * tests/Collection_Test.cpp:

          Removed duplicate template instantiation.

Sun Aug 17 16:06:20 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Shared_Object.h:

          Include "ace/os_includes/sys/os_types.h" to pull in size_t
          typedef instead of "ace/OS.h".  The latter is overkill.

        * ace/Shared_Object.cpp:

          Include "ace/Global_Macros.h" to pull in ACE_TRACE macro
          definition.

Sun Aug 17 15:31:29 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_CLEANUP_FUNC):
        * ace/config-all.h

          Moved this typedef to config-all.h.  Allows sources to use this
          typedef without including the compile-time expensive OS.h.

Fri Aug 15 14:02:22 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support to the 'make' type for AIX and IRIX.

Fri Aug 15 10:38:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a missing check for naming the foreach variable when dealing
          with grouped files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Moved the setting of LDLIBS or ACE_SHLIBS before including
          wrapper_macros.GNU.  This should allow for the kylix kludge to
          work.

Fri Aug 15 15:29:16 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Parse_Headers.cpp:
          Modified the ACCESSOR macro to only concatenate the x, or member
          variable, token.  This resolves a problem with the gcc 3.3
          preprocessor.  Thanks to Tim Hawes <thawes@althusius.net> for
          reporting the problem and Carlos O'Ryan for supplying the fix.

        * THANKS:

Fri Aug 15 09:07:09 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.{h,i}: Changed "advice" to "map_advice" to avoid a
          keyword naming conflict with AspectC++.  Thanks to Gary Duzan
          <gduzan@bbn.com> for reporting this.

Fri Aug 15 01:49:00 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Kokyu/Makefile.Kokyu:
          Moved the assignment to ACE_SHLIBS to a point prior to including
          wrapper_macros.GNU, because the code the modifies the link
          library names to work with Kylix is located in
          wrapper_macros.GNU, and must come after the assignment.

Fri Aug 15 00:37:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Added missing Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test and
          Unbounded_Set_Test_Ex projects.

Thu Aug 14 18:31:14 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Message_Queue.h:
          Added #include Null_Mutex.h and Null_Condition.h to the VxWorks
          specific branch needed due to recent subsetting.

        * ace/config-irix5.3-sgic++.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_STDINT_H.  Thanks to Bruce Jones
          <BRUCE.JONES@cubic.com> for reporting the problem.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.h:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):

          Fixed bug where the "counted down" timeout value was not used in
          the ACE::select() call.  This fixes a problem where connection
          timeouts lasted longer than they should have.  The corrected
          behavior now matches the documented behavior.

Thu Aug 14 04:02:41 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Kokyu/Makefile.Kokyu:
          Added ACELIB to ACE_SHLIBS to resolve link problems on MacOSX.

          and associated classes.

Wed Aug 13 23:43:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Bound_Ptr.i:

          defined to pickup ACE_ASSERT.

        * apps/JAWS/server/HTTP_Server.cpp:
          Added a JAWS_ prefix the enums to get around conflict on Windows
          where ASYNCH is defined as a macro.

          Added #include Log_Msg.h to pickup ACE_ASSERT.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/Performance_Test_Options.cpp:
          Added #ifdef around ACE_Trace::start/stop_tracing() based on

          subsetting.

Mon Aug 11 19:19:24 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h: Updated the documentation to point to
          the C++NPv2 and POSA2 books.  Thanks to Valery Salamakha
          <ccapstan@bigpond.net.au> for motivating this change!

Mon Aug 11 08:39:06 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Koyu_dsrt.h: Removed Kokyu_Export qualification for
          template class MUF_Comparator. This was giving compile errors in
          Win2K_VC71_NET_DLL build.

Mon Aug 11 06:35:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Kokyu/Makefile:
          Removed windows specific part in this makefile. This gave
          problems with MinGW and the MSys shell and isn't needed.

Mon Aug 11 01:46:23 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified the test for "GNU ld" to grep for the count instead of
          relying on the return value which doesn't appear to work
          correctly on all versions, specifically MacOSX and older
          versions of OpenBSD (two platforms to which I lack access).
          Thanks to John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for help
          debugging this.

Sun Aug 10 13:32:42 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Direct_Dispatcher_Impl_T.{h,cpp}: Moved the method
          definition of MoreEligible::operator() to the header file to get
          rid of MSV compiler errors. I suspect that the nested class
          MoreEligible could be causing the problem.

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Sched_Queue_T.{h,cpp}: Moved the method
          definition of Guid_Hash::operator() to the header file to get
          rid of MSV compiler errors. I suspect that the nested class
          could be causing the problem.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_dsrt.{h,cpp}: Corrected a typo and included
          Kokyu_dsrt.i instead of Kokyu.i. Removed Kokyu_Export
          qualification for template classes.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h: Added export qualification for noncopyable
          class.

Sun Aug 10 09:52:17 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Export/dll.cpp:
          Fixed a typo in last checkin, i.e., added a space.

          Added const to char* declarations to quash warnings.

        * examples/Timer_Queue/Thread_Timer_Queue_Test.cpp:
          Added #include Condition_T.h and Thread_Mutex.h needed for
          explicit template instantiation.

        * examples/Timer_Queue/Timer_Queue.mpc:
          Added "after" directive so library gets compiled first.

        * tests/Collection_Test.cpp:
          Fixed a typo in an explicit template instantiation directive.

Sat Aug  9 13:56:37 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.h: Deleted extra qualification for method
          prototype declarations to get rid of compiler warnings in
          Debian_Full_Reactors build.

        * Kokyu/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

Sat Aug  9 18:23:32 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * etc/tao_rtevent.doxygen:
          Added TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Service_Constants.h to the list
          of files that must be parsed for the RTEvent doxygen documentation

Sat Aug  9 06:17:49 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp:
          Readded explicit template instantiation of
          ACE_GUARD<ACE_PROCESS_MUTEX> and #includes needed to compile it.

Sat Aug  9 05:16:32 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified the ld version test so that it wouldn't printout error
          information to the build log on failure.

Sat Aug  9 04:21:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

          that platform_g++_common.GNU can use the value to to help

          additional checking to make sure that we only test GNU ld.

Fri Aug  8 23:23:30 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.{h,cpp,i}:
          Renamed init() method so that it does not hide the base class
          init method.

        * Kokyu/Default_Dispatcher_Impl.cpp:
          Commented out some debug statements.

Fri Aug  8 13:26:25 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.{h,cpp}: Changed typo TAO_SYNCH_MUTEX to
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX to get rid of compile errors in explicit
          template instantiation builds.

Fri Aug  8 11:03:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Remove the 'perl' call before depgen.pl.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Put back ACE_ROOT reference in the templates for the depgen.pl
          script.  It is necessary since nmake doesn't support the windows
          associates like the command prompt does.

Fri Aug  8 10:42:16 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Added Kokyu to CORE_DIRS list since
          TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs is in core build and
          TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/*Kokyu* depends on Kokyu framework.

          with these examples.

Fri Aug  8 07:10:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Moved the shflags out of the configurations and into the
          platforms.  The link flag is particular to the linker of the
          platform.

Fri Aug  8 06:56:52 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a problem with my change from Thu Aug  7 12:43:05 2003.  The
          INSTARGET needed to be set before it was used in the all:
          dependencies.

Thu Aug  7 21:47:25 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.h: Included Dispatcher_Impl.h header file instead of
          forward declaring Dispatcher_Impl. This was causing compile
          errors/warnings in some builds.

        * Kokyu/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

Thu Aug 07 16:36:29 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt-min.mpb: Added a minimal Qt
          base project for those projects which require to use Qt library
          but not ACE_QtReactor.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt-min_moc.mpb: Same twist for
          qt_moc.mpb.  Things can probably be condensed more, later.

Thu Aug  7 13:29:22 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Added Kokyu directory to DIRS and CLONE variables, so
          that it is included as part of the autobuilds and release tar
          ball. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com> for pointing
          this out.

Thu Aug  7 12:43:05 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a problem with the generic make template where a static
          library wouldn't get installed.

Thu Aug  7 13:08:28 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Unbounded_Set_Ex.cpp:
          Added #include of os_errno.h to pick up ENOMEM on older versions
          of gcc and needed due to recent subsetting.

Thu Aug  7 07:35:56 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Corrected a bug in the dependency sorting logic by removing the
          use of splice and manually moving the array entries.

Thu Aug  7 06:18:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Added a dash in front of the include for the dependency file to
          suppress warnings about missing files.

Thu Aug  7 00:12:50 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Handle_Set.i:
          Added several #includes required by the FD_ZERO macro on various
          platforms, including os_string.h, os_strings.h, and bstring.h,
          required by recent subsetting.

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp:
          Removed explicit template instantiation of
          ACE_GUARD<ACE_Process_Mutex> that doesn't appear to be needed
          within ACE and highlighted by recent subsetting.

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Added conditional #include TSS_Adapter.h when ACE_HAS_THR_C_DEST is
          defined and required by recent subsetting.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp:
          Added #include Null_Mutex.h required by recent subsetting.

        Please send all comments/questions about this commit to
        Jason Cohen, jcohen@atl.lmco.com

        LKSCTP Support added for Linux 2.5/2.6 kernels with LKSCTP patch.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.h:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.h:
          Changed default protocol from 0 to 132 (IPPROTO_SCTP).
          This forces all current usage of SOCK_SEQPACK_* to use
          SCTP.  This was done because LKSCTP support was added to
          the SOCK_SEQPACK code, but overrides with SOCK_STREAM.
          Currently, OpenSS7 and LKSCTP have different views on this.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.cpp:
          Added #ifdef ACE_HAS_LKSCTP sections to SOCK_SEQPACK_* files
          to support socket interface differences between LKSCTP and OpenSS7.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          To enable LKSCTP support on a patched Linux 2.5/2.6 kernel,
          you must supply 'sctp=lksctp' to your make command line.

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp
          Now allows automatic server selection of port.

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.LKSCTP:
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.SCTP:
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.SCTP_in_ACE:
          Made additions for LKSCTP to the documentation.

Wed Aug  6 14:13:25 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Null_Condition.h (vait):
          Removed unused variable in method declaration to quash a warning.

Wed Aug  6 03:29:03 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        Additional includes required by recent subsetting.

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.h: Lock_Adapter_T.h.
        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/http_headers.h: Null_Mutex.h.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Parse_Headers.h: Synch_Traits.h.
        * apps/soreduce/Library.h: streams.h.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Server.cpp:
          Added #ifdef around ACE_Trace calls to turn on/off tracing.

Wed Aug  6 02:27:32 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified the test for whether or not GNU ld supports the -E
          option needed to enable dynamic_casting of objects passed to
          shared libraries.  Thanks to Chris Cleeland
          <cleeland@ociweb.com> for suggesting we dynamically obtain which
          ld to use by passing the -print-prog-name to gcc, and
          Krishnakumar B <kitty@cse.wustl.edu> for the patch.

        * ace/Null_Mutex.h:
        * ace/Null_Semaphore.h:
          Removed unused variable name to silence warnings.

Tue Aug  5 17:25:35 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{cpp,h}:
          Added #includes of Reverse_Lock_T.h, Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h,
          Null_Mutex.h, and Lock_Adapter_T.h needed due to recent subsetting.

        * ace/Dump_T.cpp:
          Added #include of Global_Macros.h.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
          Added #include of the appropriate new header to get the
          definition of placement new().  Thanks to Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for this suggestion.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Removed the explicite template instantiation of ACE_Reverse_Lock
          that wasn't used and appeared to be dead code.  Thanks to Olli
          Savia <ops@iki.fi> for pointing out the problem.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.{h,cpp}:
          Moved #include of Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h from the
          cpp to the header since it's used as a member variable.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/APC.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Abandoned.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Registration.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Registry_Changes.cpp:
          Added #include of Auto_Event.h needed due to recent subsetting
          changes.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
          Added #include of Thread_Semaphore needed due to recent
          subsetting changes.

Tue Aug  5 15:16:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_limit.h:
          Moved define for PIPE_BUF from os_errno.h, where it have been
          moved by mistake (see Mon Aug  4 13:08:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com>) to os_limit.h.

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_wait.h:
          Moved define for WNOHANG from os_errno.h, where it have been
          moved by mistake (see Mon Aug  4 13:08:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com>) to sys/os_wait.h.

Tue Aug  5 01:17:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Rolled back part of the fix from Mon Aug  4 21:02:12 UTC 2003
          Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>.  Some of the cpp still
          needs to be ifdef'd out for single threaded builds.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp:
          Added #include Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h needed on some
          Windows builds.

Mon Aug  4 21:02:12 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/TSS_T.{h,cpp}:
          Removed ACE_HAS_THREADS #ifdef around ACE_TSS* classes that
          shouldn't have been there, and was erroneously added when the
          code was moved.  Although ACE_TSS probably should be ifdef'd and
          the ACE_TSS_TYPE macros used, that wasn't the purpose of the
          move, so it was set back to the way it was.

        * ace/Free_List.h:
          Added #include os_stddef.h to pick up size_t.  Thanks to John
          Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for submitting this patch.

Mon Aug  4 17:03:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Bound_Ptr.i:
          Added #include of Guard_T.h.

        * apps/mkcsregdb/mkcsregdb.cpp:
          Added #include of Log_Msg.h.

        * examples/Export/dll.h:
          Added #include of Null_Mutex.h.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/post_completions.cpp:
          Added #include of Thread_Mutex.h and changed ACE_Thread_Mutex to
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.

        * examples/Smart_Pointers/Gadget_Part.h.
          Added #include Synch_Traits.h and Thread_Mutex.h.

Mon Aug  4 13:56:31 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Synch_T.h:
          Added #include Synch.h to insure backward compatibility on
          non-threaded builds.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
          Added #include ACE.h needed when not inlining.

Mon Aug  4 13:08:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
          Moved some additional error code definitions to os_errno.h.
          This will fix compile errors on FreeBSD.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ARPA_INET_H.  This will fix compile problems on
          Windows.

Mon Aug  4 09:31:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Added VxWorks includes for shared library functions.

        * ace/OS.i:
          Implemented access, dlerror and dlopen for VxWorks. There is no
          reference counting on dlopen, when calling it multiple times on
          the same shared lib it will load the same lib multiple times,
          this because VxWorks has no reference counting. Use these with
          care because of the strange VxWorks implementation. Thanks to
          Marc Walrave <marc.walrave@meco.nl> for creating this.

Mon Aug  4 23:47:33 2003  Ossama Othman <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Array_Base.cpp:

          For MSVC++ 6, include standard C++ <new> header to pull in
          placement new() operator prototype.  Addresses template
          instantiation errors.

Mon Aug  4 22:41:24 2003  Ossama Othman <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:

          Include "ace/Guard_T.h" to pull in ACE_Guard template
          declaration.

        * ace/MEM_Addr.cpp:

          Include "ace/OS.h" to pull in ACE_OS::strtoul() static function
          prototype.

        * ace/Process_Semaphore.h:

          Include "ace/Semaphore.h" to pull in the ACE_Semaphore class
          declaration for the (ACE_WIN32 || ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM || ACE_PSOS)
          case.

        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:

          Include "ace/ACE.h" to pull in ACE::strnew() function prototype.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:

          Include "ace/ACE.h" to pull in ACE::debug() function prototype.

        * ace/Token.h:

          Fixed compile-time problems in MSVC++ builds.  Some headers must
          still be included for the ACE_TOKEN_USES_SEMAPHORE case.

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:

          Include "ace/Null_Mutex.h" to pull in ACE_Null_Mutex class
          declaration.

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.h:

          Include "ace/Auto_Event.h" to pull in ACE_Auto_Event class
          declaration.

        * ace/Thread_Mutex.h:
        * ace/Token.{h,i}:
          Added or adjusted placement of #ifdef ACE_HAS_THREADS in order
          to fix compile errors on single threaded builds.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.h:
          Added #include ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h needed for single
          threaded builds.

          Refactored the includes due to Synch changes above.

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Added "__ACE_INLINE__" and ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE to
          PREDEFINES so that the all the includes would show up in the
          doxygen file reference pages.

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h,cpp}:
          Removed the static log_msg_tss_key_ variable from ACE_Log_Msg
          and added a free function in Log_Msg.cpp with a static local
          variable to hold the same value.  The obviates the need to
          include OS.h in Log_Msg.h.

Sun Aug  3 20:55:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_Reassembly_Test.cpp:
        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_UDP_Best_Effort_Test.cpp: #included ACE.h to
          get rid of compile errors in the full reactor build.

Sat Aug  2 17:50:30 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:

          Added #include of ace/Handle_Set.h.

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.h:

        * ace/String_Base.cpp: Changed all the includes of OS.h and
          Malloc.h to OS_String.h and Malloc_Base.h, since that is
          sufficient. Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan for providing the
          patches. This helps to improve the compilation time of ACE and
          its applications that use the above features.

Fri Aug  1 14:55:00 2003  Dan Troesser  <troesser_d@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Added -a (absolute) option to correspond with original
          create_ace_build script.

Fri Aug  1 14:52:17 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Removed the legacy libpaths. They make the log output too long, and
        seem to cause a problem with some nightly builds for some
        unknown reason. We'll just have to be careful not to check in
        mpc-generated files without editing for reverse compatibility.

Fri Aug  1 12:37:59 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Added setting of ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_DL

Fri Aug  1 07:21:39 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a 'forcount' which provides a one based index of the foreach
          iterations.

Fri Aug  1 06:37:39 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where pch files were being picked up even if they did
          not end with a valid extension.

Thu Jul 31 14:22:17 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/property.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtoldevent.mpb:

          Added .disable to the list of files that won't be linked
        by create_ace_build.pl.
          Added legacy libpaths so that generated Makefiles will be
        reverse compatible with existing ones, as a temporary
        workaround until everything is MPC generated.
          Fixed some typos in base mpb files.

Thu Jul 31 13:12:17 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          The KEEP_GOING flag is automatically set now.  It is keyed off of
          the -k option to make.  If -k is passed to make, then KEEP_GOING
          will be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to 0.

Thu Jul 31 11:36:35 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added the ability for the main Makefile to stop after the first
          error.  By default, it moves on to the next makefile when an error
          is encountered.  Now, set the make macro KEEP_GOING to zero to
          have it stop after the first error is encountered.

Thu Jul 31 16:14:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/C++NPv2.mpc:
        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.mpc:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/WFMO_Reactor.mpc:
        * examples/Registry/Registry.mpc:
          Added a verbatim tag that ifdef's out the entire Makefile on
          non-Windows systems.  This code can probably be factored out
          into a platform specific template that Windows only project
          inherit. Also, this will probably prevent these project from
          being built with Cygwin and MinGW, since the only test for the
          MAKE variable, not a Windows specific variable.

Thu Jul 31 07:42:57 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * apps/soreduce/Obj_Module.cpp (add_source):
        * apps/soreduce/SO_Group.cpp (add_executable): Fixed bugs where
          application code was being called within ACE_ASSERT macros,
          which were disappearing when ACE_NDEBUG was enabled!  Thanks to
          Roland Meub <roland.meub@gmx.de> for reporting this fix.

Thu Jul 31 01:29:16 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/Export/Export.mpc:
          Added sharedname to library project and libs to executable so
          they would link correctly.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/fifo_sap.mpc:
        * examples/Smart_Pointers/Smart_Pointers.mpc:
          Fixed minor typo's in exename and sourcefile name.

Thu Jul 31 00:49:18 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        These are changes needed in order to use MPC.

        * examples/Registry/test_registry_update.cpp:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/Timer_Service.cpp:
          Modified include order and added ifdef's around WIN32 specific
          code so these projects will compile on non-Windows platforms,
          since MPC doesn't currently allow you to easily exclude projects
          based on platform.

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp:
        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-connector.cpp:
          Removed an unused parameter and added parentheses to fix compile
          warnings and errors.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_multiple_loops.cpp:
          Fixed a capitalization typo in an include, and added an else
          branch to define a main() function.

        * examples/RMCast/Send_File/RMCast_Send_File.mpc:
        * tests/RMCast/acetest.mpb:
          Added a "requires += rmcast" so that these projects would only
          be compiled if libRMCast had been compiled, i.e., rmcast=1.

        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/Options.cpp:
        * examples/Shared_Malloc/Options.cpp:
          Added ACE_HAS_TRACE macro that gets defined if ACE_NTRACE=0 and
          is used to ifdef away calls to ACE_Trace when not tracing.  This
          removes the need to link in Trace.o for static applications not
          tracing.

          Adjusted includes to reflect the above change by mainly removing
          Trace.h, though in some cases by including Global_Macros.h or
          Trace.h for the two tests.

        * bin/generate_export_file.pl:
          Made the generated code match what's in Global_Macros.h:

        * ace/Select_Reactor.h:
          When ACE_MT_SAFE=0, ifdef away the unused template specialization
          of ACE_Guard<ACE_Select_Reactor_Token_T<ACE_Noop_Token>>.

Wed Jul 30 17:00:03 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Removed erroneous casting of timeLow. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing this out.

Wed Jul 30 02:18:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added macros to check for existence of stdint.h and inttypes.h
          and define the appropriate ACE_LACKS_* macro is they are
          missing.

        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h:
          Added check for UNIXWARE_7_1 before defining default values for
          several THR_* macros.  Terletsky Oleg
          <oleg.terletsky@comverse.com> for supplying these patches.

Tue Jul 29 09:59:35 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Changed the #includes to use the ace directory.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added Metrics_Cache.cpp and UUID.cpp.

Tue Jul 29 09:39:58 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcpartialmacros.mpt:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Change the way the 'implicit' keyword works.  It now takes both
          boolean values and character strings that represent base projects
          for implicitly generated projects.  See the README for more
          details.

        * examples/examples.mwc:

          Utilize the new 'implicit' functionality.

Mon Jul 28 22:00:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          Fixed typo in preprocessor directive.

Mon Jul 28 19:23:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:
          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG to dump to silence a warning when
          ACE_HAS_DUMP is not defined.

Mon Jul 28 18:29:38 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp:
          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG to dump_i and dump_node_i to silence a
          warning when ACE_HAS_DUMP is not defined.

Mon Jul 28 13:01:49 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.cpp: The implementations are now placed in a namespace
          ACE_Utils. Since we can now use namespaces, adding them to a
          namespace made more sense.

        * ace/UUID.i: File UUID.i is now renamed to be UUID.inl

        * ace/UUID.inl: New file.

        * tests/UUIDTest.cpp: Changes to confirm to the above changes.

Mon Jul 28 12:49:23 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added the ability to uppercase and lowercase strings within the
          templates.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/automake.mpd:
        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Added initial support for Automake.  This is by no means complete
          or even correct, but it's a starting point.  Perhaps someone who
          knows something about Automake could make the automake template
          better (correct).

Mon Jul 28 09:36:15 2003  Gan Deng  <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst
          Put the Bug_1551_Regression test into the daily builds.

          bodies of the dump() methods is it isn't defined.  This will
          help reduce footprint for deployed applications that don't use
          dump().  Currently, it is not defined by default.

Sun Jul 27 12:51:14 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

          Deleted these files.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.dsp:
        * Kokyu/Kokyu_Static.dsp:
          Updated due to the above deletion.

Sun Jul 27 12:13:31 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

          Replaced with Kokyu.dsp.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.mwc:
          Deleted this until I am able to get the mwc based generation
          working.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.mpc:
          Changed "dllflags" keyword to "dynamicflags". This was causing
          build errors in Win2K_VC71_NET_DLL Remedy build. Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for pointing this out.

        * Kokyu/Makefile.Kokyu:

Sat Jul 26 22:08:48 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h (getmacaddress):
          Removed unused local variable.  Resolves compile warnings on
          Sun.

Sat Jul 26 13:25:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Modified example to reflect new Kokyu dispatcher class.

Thu Jul 24 14:23:44 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Future.{h,cpp}: Removed the operator new/delete/& so
          that ACE_Future can be stored in STL containers (e.g.,
          sets/maps/etc.).  Thanks to Felix Wyss <FelixW@inin.com>,
          Patrick Bennett <Patrick.Bennett@inin.com>, and Johnny Tucker
          for helping with this.

Fri Jul 25 17:32:58 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Define ACE_DEFAULT_SHLIB_MODE to be RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL
          when ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING, not just for Linux.
          Thanks to Krishnakumar B <kitty@cse.wustl.edu> for suggesting
          this.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx.GNU:  Add with_ld=macosx.
        * include/makeinclude/plafform_g++_common.GNU:
          Don't add "-Wl,-E" to LDFLAGS when with_ld=macosx.  Thanks to
          John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> pointing out the problem
          and supplying a patch.  Also, thanks to Craig Rodrigues
          <crodrigu@bbn.com> for suggesting we set the default for
          with_ld=gnu and only add "-Wl,-E", which id gnu linker
          specific, if we're using the gnu version of ld.

Fri Jul 25 11:37:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added the ability to access grouped source files through the
          template.  The grouped_source_files, grouped_header_files, etc.
          can be used if the files are grouped in the mpc file (as they
          currently are in ace.mpc).

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Utilize the new template ability and remove the 'gnu_source_files'
          and 'build' references and code.

Fri Jul 25 09:17:39 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh:
        * bin/generate_performance_chart.sh: Redefined the range for
          plotting different graphs.

Fri Jul 25 08:53:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh: Changed the path to mogrify. On
          flamenco.dre it is installed in /usr/local instead of
          /usr/bin/X11. This would break the stats pages at UCI. The pages
          at UCI haven't been updated in a long while. Hence shouldn't be a
          big deal.

          With this change the thumbnails should be fine at dre pages.

Fri Jul 25 11:10:21 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Only do a pragma comment with MSVC

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
          Added UUID
        * ace/UUID.h:
          Fixed compile error with Borland

        * ace/UUID.cpp:
          Improved log line.

        * tests/UUIDTest.cpp:
          Fix compile problem in unicode build and ACE_START_TEST to
          get logfile.

        * tests/Tests.bor:
          Added UUIDTest

Fri Jul 25 09:34:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Also include nb30.h with MinGW and Borland, but don't do a
          pragma comment with MinGW

        * ace/OS.cpp (getmacaddress):
          Fixed incorrect trace, with Borland and MinGW use a reinterpret
          cast instead of a static cast.

Thu Jul 24 17:32:51 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

        Added:
        $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/examples/Notify/Lanes/run_test.pl: !ST !MINIMUM
        $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/examples/Notify/ThreadPool/run_test.pl: !ST !MINIMUM

Thu Jul 24 16:23:53 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_performance_chart.sh: Changed the scale to which
          the graph is plotted.

Thu Jul 24 14:00:29 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DEV_IO.h (recv_n):
        * ace/DEV_IO.i: The semantics of recv_n () is now changed to have
          a timeout and a byte transferred variable. The interface now has
          the semantics associated with ACE_OS::recv_n () and ACE::recv_n
          () calls. Thanks to Tom Phan <tom.phan@telhub.com>.

Thu Jul 24 15:01:59 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Added check for !static_libs_only before setting LDFLAGS +=
          -Wl,-E, since the static_libs and shared_libs variables aren't
          reset until later in wrapper_macros.GNU, e.g., users can either
          set shared_libs=0 or static_libs_only=1 to turn off shared_libs.

          Rolled back the part of Wed Jul 23 23:47:52 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com> that changed LDFLAGS in
          platform_linux.GNU, and instead added the same code to
          platform_g++_common.GNU for shared libs only.  This should
          fix the spike in footprint that showed up this morning due to
          yesterday's change.

Thu Jul 24 01:19:59 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/DLL_Test.dsp:
        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.dsp:
          Enabled RTTI so we can test dynamic_cast'ing in a dll.

Wed Jul 23 23:47:52 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Changed ACE_DEFAULT_SHLIB_MODE to be RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL on Linux
          in order to enable dynamic_cast'ing in shared libraries loaded by
          ACE_DLL.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Added -Wl,-E to LDFLAGS to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol
          table in order to enable dynamic_cast'ing in shared libraries
          loaded by ACE_DLL.  Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic
          <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> for reporting this and providing the fix.

        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp:
        * tests/DLL_Test.h:
        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.cpp:
          Added a dynamic_cast test to the existing DLL_Test.

        * THANKS:
          Added Milan Cvetkovic <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> to the hall of fame.

Wed Jul 23 12:43:48 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Added missing ACE_RCSID macro.

          (UUID_node):

          Use UUID_node::NODE_ID_SIZE instead of the hardcoded constant
          "6".  Improves code maintainability.

          (ACE_UUID):

          Corrected format specifier mismatch warnings in sscanf() call
          exhibited by G++ 3.2.2.  Hexadecimal format specifiers ("%x")
          expect the corresponding argument to be an unsigned int, not a
          signed int.

Wed Jul 23 19:35:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * THANKS:
          Added Serkan Unsal <serkan_u2000@yahoo.com> to hall of fame.

Wed Jul 23 18:03:21 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Include os_math.h here so it always gets included before
          ACE.h, since math.h defines log2 as macro that conflicts with
          the method ACE::log2().

        * ace/ace/String_Base.cpp:
          Remove #include "ace/streams.h" and let the cpp's that actually
          use it include it themselves.  This helps reduce both footprint
          and compile-times.  Thanks to Bala Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> for motivating this change.

Wed Jul 23 17:34:56 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.h:
          Document for ACE_Registry_ImpExp that the value after dword is read
          in hexidecimal format. Thanks to Todd Cooper <todd@DO11073.com> for
          reporting this.

Tue Jul 22 22:46:18 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Fixed a typo in the documentation of read_n ().

Tue Jul 22 23:24:53 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp (ACE_Thread_ID::to_string):
          Fixed WCHAR build errors by making all types char instead of
          ACE_TCHAR and removing ACE_LIB_TEXT macros.

Tue Jul 22 19:20:16 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

          Included the UUID generator files into the project to compile on
          windows.

        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/UUIDTest.dsp:

          Updated tests.dsw to include the corresponding UUIDTest.dsp
          project for the unit test UUIDTest which tests the ACE UUID
          generator.

Tue Jul 22 16:43:01 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i:
          Changed new rand_r() implementation a little bit

Tue Jul 22 15:12:02 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/iosfwd.h:
          Added #include "ace/streams.h" if __APPLE_CC__ is defined.  This
          fixes problems with gperf hanging on MAC OSX.  Thanks to John
          Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for reporting the problem and
          supplying the patch.

Tue Jul 22 14:59:59 UTC 2003 Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Rolled back Wed Jun 18 17:28:25 2003  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> and added _GNU_SOURCE instead.  If
          _GNU_SOURCE is defined, these defaults plus a few others
          including _XOPEN_SOURCE, get set by default--and defaults can
          and do change over time.  This should also cleanup warnings on
          Debian builds.

Tue Jul 22 10:29:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp: Fixed compile error; #elif should be #else.
        * ace/UUID.cpp: Added #include "ace/Log_Msg.h" to pick up the necessary
          things for doing logging (ACE_DEBUG, etc.).

Tue Jul 22 06:01:03 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Select_Reactor_T.cpp:
        * Timer_Heap_T.cpp:
        * Timer_List_T.cpp:
        * Timer_Wheel_T.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect ACE_TRACE statements to fix fuzz errors.

Tue Jul 22 05:44:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i:
          Added an implementation for rand_r() on Win32. Thanks to
          Kees van Marle <kvmarle@remedy.nl> for noticing the lack of this
          implementation.

Tue Jul 22 00:19:39 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Added #include "ace/streams.h" to resolve compile error.

Mon Jul 21 22:57:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added check for "/**/" comment in pre.h/post.h includes.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for motivating this.

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
        * ace/Strategies.h:
        * ace/UUID.h:
        * docs/tutorials/022/Acceptor_Service.h:
        * Kokyu/*.h:
          Added comment that adding "/**/" between the #include and the
          filenames in order to improve doxygen documentation.

Mon Jul 21 22:52:46 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Moved #include <net/if_arp.h> from OS.h to OS.cpp. This
          should resolve the compile errors on solaris.

Mon Jul 21 08:59:14 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp (get_systemtime):

          Temporary fix to get the compiles rolling again.

Mon Jul 21 01:56:44 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Added method getmacaddress () to get the mac address of the host
          for generating UUIDs

          Added to_string() method to ACE_Thread_ID class to create a
          string representation of ACE_Thread_ID.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:

          Included file nb30.h and library netapi32.lib required for
          obtaining MACaddress on windows.

        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.cpp:
        * ace/UUID.i:

          Files added to generate UUID (Universally Unique ID) based on
          expired IETF draft titled "UUIDs and GUIDs". Modifications were
          made to the UUID generation as defined by the specification to
          add thread and process ids. This was done by adding a new
          variant 0xc0 not defined by the specification. By default only
          the time variant version of the UUID as defined by the spec is
          generated.

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
        * tests/UUIDTest.cpp:

          Simple test added to verify ACE UUID generation.

Sun Jul 20 14:14:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/NT_Service.i (ACE_NT_Service): Set dwWaitHint to 0 in the
          constructor.  Thanks to Emiliano Berenbaum <eberenb@yahoo.com>
          for reporting this.

Fri Jul 18 18:59:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Clarified that ACE+TAO no longer build with
          MSVC++ 5.x or earlier.  Thanks to Amol Tambe
          <Amol.Tambe@ideas.com> for reporting this.

Sat Jul 19 18:38:50 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html:
          Added comment that adding "/**/" between the #include and the
          file name prevents Doxygen from including the file in the file
          reference tree graphs, and should be used with pre.h and
          post.h--which makes the large ones much easier to understand.

          graphs.

          Fixed doxygen warnings.

Fri Jul 18 10:36:51 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * THANKS: Added Dieter Knüppel <dknueppel@datus.com> to the
          contributors list.

Thu Jul 17 15:02:56 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv1/Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Added #include "ace/streams.h".

Thu Jul 17 12:49:39 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/NT_Service/main.cpp:

Thu Jul 17 06:21:30 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the name of borland projects to just be the project name
          .bor.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the default workspace names for nmake and borland to
          Makefile.  Additionally, I added an option (-make_coexistence)
          to allow the gnuace, nmake and borland types to coexist.  This
          option causes the default workspace names for nmake and borland to
          work as they previously had.  The nmake workspace would be
          workspace name .nmake and the borland workspace would be named
          Makefile.bor.

Wed Jul 16 15:29:37 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Fixed to link include/makeinclude/*.bor files.
          A few more link exclusions were added.

Wed Jul 16 15:27:37 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h (find_handler):

          Pure virtual specifier for find_handler() was a cut and paste
          error.

          Switched the zzip configuration information over to use the
          feature based style instead of doing it within the templates.
          Now, to enable zzip use the -feature_file option to specify a file
          that has 'zzip=1' and 'zlib=1'.  For more information on the
          -feature_file option see the README.
           (or use bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features)

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/zziplib.mpt:

        * ace/iosfwd.h:
          Removed all references to ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION.
          It was used to include ace/iosfwd.h instead of ace/streams.h,
          but files should only include one they need instead of always
          including ace/streams.h, which includes <iostream> if available
          and unnecessarily increases compile times.  Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan
          <coryan@atdesk.com> motivating this.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          Removed the #ifdefs for ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION and
          always include ace/iosfwd.h.

        * ace/OS_Log_Msg_Attributes.h:
          Replaced include of ace/streams.h with ace/iosfwd.h in order
          to improve compile times

Tue Jul 16 11:43:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Some tests where based on aceexe, changes this to acetest. This
          fixes problems with vc71.

Tue Jul 15 06:22:55 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/zlib.mpb:

          Added the zlib feature (disabled by default).  This will allow
          users to enable the zlib feature and pull in include paths, lib
          paths and library which will be dependent upon the ZLIB_ROOT
          environment variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where false warnings would be displayed if
          MPC_VERBOSE_ORDERING was set.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added a rule to create the libout directory.
          Fixed a bug in the gnu template that only affected TAO libraries
          that had 'requires' or 'avoids'.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Fixed a problem with cppflags and dependencies.

        * bin/depgen.pl:

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
          When building for VxWorks also include errnoLib.h

        * ace/OS.cpp (inet_aton):
          Fixed VxWorks specific implementation. Thanks to Eric Held

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Removed windows specific use of cmd. This is not needed and
          causes problems when using MinGW with the MSYS shell on windows.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:
          Threading compiles with cygwin again, so no need anymore to set
          threads to 0 when not defined.

        * ChangeLog:
          Fixed fuzz errors about backslashed in file path

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp:

Mon Jul 14 11:16:25 2003  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: FreeBSD defines the sysconf value
          for _SC_AIO_LISTIO_MAX to 16, and the sysconf value for
          _SC_AIO_MAX to be 1024.  The lower value must be assigned to
          aiocb_list_max_size_ otherwise aio_suspend() will fail.  There
          was already already some logic in here to support HPUX that also
          works for FreeBSD, so use that.

          though the correct decision should have been:

            if (this->cur_size_ + this->cur_limbo_ + 2 >= this->max_size_)

          Without this, tests/Timer_Queue_Test was failing with
          cur_size_ = 15, cur_limbo_ = 20 and max_size_ = 35, but insert()
          did not regrow the heap and eventually schedule() failed.

Mon Jul 07 18:00:38 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * The following changes are related to improving memory management
          of Event Handlers when they interact with Reactors (and Timer
          Queues).  When a handler is registered with the Reactor, the
          Reactor increments the reference count on the handler.  The
          Reactor also increments this reference count when making upcalls
          on the handler.  The reference count is decremented when an
          upcall completes or when the handler is removed from the
          Reactor.

          This mechanism is similar to what happens between POAs and
          Servants and it allows for the safe deletion of handlers.  This
          mechanism is particularly need for multi-threaded applications
          that can have multiple threads executing upcalls on a handler
          that needs to be shutdown in a safe manner.  The following
          illustrates an example of how this mechanism works:

          - When a handler is created, it reference count is one.

          - After the handler is registered with the Reactor, it reference
          count becomes two.

          - At this point, the handler creator can let go of the handler
          reference, bringing down the reference count to one.

          - For each thread executing upcalls on the handler, the Reactor
          increments the reference count by one. So if three threads were
          simultaneously making upcalls on a handler, the reference count
          would be four.

          - Assuming an external event (and thread) decides to close the
          handler.  It simply removes the handler from the Reactor.  This
          decreases the reference count to three.

          - As each thread completes their upcall, the reference reduces.

          - Once the final thread exits the upcall, the reference reaches
          zero, and the handler is finally deleted.

          This mechanism ensures that the handler is not deleted until the
          final upcall thread exits the handler.

          Reference counting on handlers is optional and is disabled by
          default.  To enable reference counting on a handler, reset its
          reference counting policy to "ENABLED".

          To facilitate reference counting of handlers, an
          ACE_Event_Handler_var class was added.  This class is akin to
          the PortableServer::ServantBase_var class.

          Similar reference counting related changes were made to the
          Timer Queues so that handlers can be used in a thread safe
          manner with the queues.

          The Connector implementation was completely revised to utilize
          the new memory management mechanisms and remove existing
          concurrency bugs.

          Several new examples/tests were added:

          - tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test
          - tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test
          - tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test
          - tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test
          - tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test
          - tests/Reactor_Registration_Test
          - tests/WFMO_Reactor_Test
          - tests/Timer_Cancellation_Test

          Details follow below:

        Fri May 09 20:13:37 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Event_Handler:

          Added reference counting capabilities to the event handler.  The
          reference counting will be used for event handler memory
          management by Reactors that will call add_reference() and
          remove_reference() during registrations, removals, and upcalls.
          This mechanism is similar to the protocol between servants and
          POAs.

          Reference counting is configurable and can be controlled by the
          Reference_Counting_Policy which is disabled by default.

          Added a ACE_Event_Handler_var auto pointer like class for
          Event Handlers.  This class calls
          ACE_Event_Handler::remove_reference() in its destructor.

          Added reactor_timer_interface() method that returns the
          Reactor's timer related interface.

        * ace/Reactor_Timer_Interface.h:

          Added a new class ACE_Reactor_Timer_Interface that contains
          timer related (pure virtual) methods of the Reactor.  This
          allows us to make timer related calls on the Reactor from the
          Timer Queue without having to include Reactor.h.

      * ace/Reactor:

          Vastly improved documentation, specially with respect to how the
          reference counting works.

          Made the Reactor class inherit from ACE_Reactor_Timer_Interface
          so that timer related calls can be made on the Reactor from the
          Timer Queue without having to include Reactor.h.

        * ace/Reactor:
        * ace/Reactor_Impl:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor:

          Added a new find_handler() method that returns the event handler
          associated with a <handle>.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:

          - bind(): Make sure that the user is not registering a different
          handler for an existing handle in the
          Reactor_Handler_Repository.  Also, if it is a new entry, call
          add_reference() if reference counting is needed.

          - unbind(): Call remove_reference() if the removal is complete
          and reference counting is needed. Also, Bala's change:

          Mon Apr  7 16:58:55 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          is no longer necessary since handle_close() is now only called
          once the Reactor state has been completely updated.

          - mask_ops(): If the handle is not suspended, then set the ops
          on the <wait_set_>, otherwise set the <suspend_set_>.

          - handler_i(): Add to reference count of event handler before
          returning to the user if reference counting is needed.

          - ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::dispatch_notify():
          - ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::purge_pending_notifications():
          - ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::notify():

          Added reference counting for notifies.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T:

          notify_handle(): Added reference counting to upcalls.

        * ace/TP_Reactor:

          - remove_handler(): All remove_handler() specializations can be
          removed since there no longer is the requirement of calling
          handle_close() from outside the Reactor lock.

          - handle_timer_events(): Call preinvoke() and postinvoke() on
          the timer queue so that timer upcalls can be reference counted.

          - handle_socket_events(): Added reference counting to upcalls.

          - mask_ops(): Specialization no longer necessary since the base
          class now does the right thing.

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor:

          - handler(): Original handler() method was not locked.

          - bind_i(): Call add_reference() if reference counting is
          needed.

          - make_changes_in_current_infos():
          - make_changes_in_suspension_infos():
          - make_changes_in_to_be_added_infos():

          The iteration loop was incorrect.  When an entry was replaced
          from the one at the end, the newly shifted entry was skipped and
          not evaluated.  make_changes_in_to_be_added_infos() did not need
          this change since entries are not moved around in the
          <to_be_added_info_> set.

          Also, call remove_reference() if reference counting if needed.

          - complex_dispatch_handler(): Added reference counting to
          upcalls.

          - ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Notify::purge_pending_notifications():
          - ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Notify::notify():
          - ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Notify::handle_signal():

          Added reference counting for notifies.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T:

          - Not sure why we were including Test_and_Set.h when we only
          needed to include Event_Handler.h.

          - dispatch_info() and dispatch_info_i(): Made these virtual so
          that they can be specialized.

          - ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T: Added <recurring_timer_> so
          that we can determine if we need to call remove_reference() if
          it is not a recurring timer and if reference counting is
          required.  This value is passed to the timeout() method of the
          upcall functor.

          - timeout(): When handle_timeout() returns -1, invoke
          cancel_timer() on the reactor if the event handler has a valid
          reactor, otherwise invoke cancel() on the timer queue.  It is
          necessary to get the same locking as was used when registering
          the timer, which was potentially done holding the reactor lock
          while the timer queue could have been configured with a null
          lock.

          - schedule():  No longer a pure virtual method.  It now grabs
          the lock, call schedule_i(), and finally calls registration() on
          the upcall functor.

          - registration(): This method is called when a timer is
          registered.

          - preinvoke(): Invokes add_reference() on the event handler if
          reference counting is required before making the upcall.

          - upcall(): Changed the signature to pass
          ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T instead of the individual
          parameters.

          - postinvoke(): Invokes remove_reference() on the event handler
          if reference counting is required after making the upcall.

          - cancel_type() and cancel_timer(): Split cancellation() into
          two methods.  cancel_timer() is called when a timer is
          canceled.  cancel_type() is called when a handler is
          canceled. Also added <dont_call> parameter to these method.
          cancel_timer() will be used for reference counting and
          cancel_type() will be used for calling handle_close().

          - expire(): Call preinvoke() before calling upcall() and
          postinvoke() after calling upcall().

          - deletion(): Now calls cancel_type() and cancel_timer() for
          each timer remaining in the queue.

        * ace/Timer_List_T:
        * ace/Timer_Wheel_T:
        * ace/Timer_Heap_T:
        * ace/Timer_Hash_T:

          - schedule_i(): This method replaces the old schedule() method.
          Locking is not necessary anymore.

          - cancel(): This method will call cancel_timer() once for each
          timer canceled and cancel_type() once for each handler
          canceled.

          - cancel_i(): The <skip_close> check will be performed in the
          upcall functor.

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T:

          - ~ACE_Timer_Heap_T(): Don't use <cur_size_> for the for loop
          since it reduces after free_node() is called.

          - cancel(): Not sure why this is the only cancel() where the
          upcall is made outside the lock.

        * ace/Timer_Wheel_T:

          - expire(): Made this method similar to Timer_Queue_T::expire()
          by (a) invoking preinvoke() before calling upcall() and invoking
          postinvoke() after calling upcall() and (b) making sure that we
          skip past time values that have already "expired" when
          rescheduling.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T:

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall: Updated this upcall functor to match
          the new APIs.

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::registration():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::cancel_type():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::cancel_timer():

          Nothing to be done in these methods since
          registration/cancellation will be handled by the upcall functor
          of the timer hash.

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::preinvoke():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::postinvoke():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::preinvoke():

          Assert that these methods never get invoked since we don't
          invoke expire() on the buckets.

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::deletion(): Call up to the upcall
          functor of the timer hash since the timer hash does not invoke
          deletion() on its upcall functor directly.  This is because
          entries are actually registered with the buckets, and this
          method will be invoked when the buckets are cleaned up.

          - Hash_Token: Added TYPE information to the token.  This
          required templatizing Hash_Token since TYPE is a template
          parameter.

          - reschedule(): Cancel the old timer before registering the new
          one.  Otherwise, the old timer will always remain in the
          buckets.  Also, make sure that the new bucket position is noted.

          - dispatch_info_i(): This method needs to be specialized to give
          the original act and not the modified act.

          - free_node(): Needs to cancel the timer in addition to freeing
          the node.

          - expire(): Only call cancel() for timers that don't need to be
          rescheduled.  reschedule() takes care of removing the old timer
          for timers that need to be rescheduled.  Also, made this method
          similar to Timer_Queue_T::expire() by invoking preinvoke()
          before calling upcall() and invoking postinvoke() after calling
          upcall().

        * ace/Proactor:

          Updated ACE_Proactor_Handle_Timeout_Upcall upcall functor to
          match the new APIs.

        * ace/Connector:

          Completely reworked the Connector to utilize the reference
          counting provided by the Reactor.  This new design fixes bugs
          1405 and 1408.

          - There used to be a hash map that mapped handles to service
          handlers.  There is no need for this map since the Reactor
          already keeps this mapping.  We now keep a simple handle set to
          remember the non-blocking connects in progress.  This will help
          when the Connector is closing down and we need to cancel the
          non-blocking connections in progress.

          - The Connector no longer needs to inherit from
          ACE_Service_Object since it does not register with the Reactor.
          We now use ACE_NonBlocking_Connect_Handler for handling
          non-blocking connects. The resume(), suspend(), and init()
          no-ops, and fini() and info() were removed.

          - The <mutex_> is no longer needed since we use the Reactor lock
          to do all our synchronization.  This will solve bug 1408.

          - We no longer need the <closing_> flag.

          - Need to add a <reactor_> field since the Connector is no
          longer an event handler.

          - Reference counting of ASTs is no longer needed since event
          handlers are reference counted.

          Thanks to Andrew Voumard <andrewv@melbpc.org.au> for helping
          with this.

        * tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test:

          This test is used to check reference counting of the Event
          Handler when it interacts with the Reactor.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test:

          This test tries to represents what happens in the TAO ORB wrt to
          event handlers, reactors, timer queues, threads, and connection
          caches, minus the other complexities.  The following three
          Reactors are tested: Select, TP, and WFMO.

          The test checks proper use and shutting down of client-side
          event handlers when it is used by invocation threads and/or
          event loop threads.  Server-side event handlers are either
          threaded or reactive. A purger thread is introduced to check the
          connection recycling and cache purging.  Nested upcalls are also
          tested.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test:

          This test is used to check reference counting of the event
          handlers when it interacts with the reactor notification
          mechanism.

        * tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test:

          New test is used to check reference counting of the Event
          Handler when it interacts with Timer Queues.

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test:

          This test checks for the proper working of the following:
          - blocking connections
          - blocking connections with timeouts
          - non-blocking connections
          - non-blocking connections without waiting for completions
          - non-blocking connections with timeouts

        * tests/Reactor_Registration_Test:

          This is a test of registering handlers with the Reactor.

        * tests/WFMO_Reactor_Test:

          New test of the WFMO_Reactor.  It makes sure that removals and
          suspensions work correctly.

        * tests/Timer_Cancellation_Test:

          A test to ensure the timer cancellation works correctly.

          Removed this file since it has become obsolete.

        Wed May 14 17:56:13 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/OS.i:

          - event_timedwait(): For relative times, the <timeout> parameter
          was being modified.  Instead use a stack variable such that the
          <timeout> parameter is not modified.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T:

          - expire(): Remove nodes from the buckets instead of simply
          getting them and canceling them later.  Also, if timers were
          expired, find the new earliest time.

          - reschedule(): No need to cancel the timer node since it is now
          removed from the bucket in expire().

          - free_node(): No need for this function since nodes are removed
          from the bucket in expire().

          - cancel(): No need to pass <act> to bucket's cancel() since the
          act comes from the Hash Token.  Also, only perform upcall and
          related cleanup on successful bucket cancel.

          - Added asserts in the code since there is not enough error
          checking (and recovery) going on.

        * ace/Reactor:
        * ace/Reactor_Impl:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor:

          Renamed handler() to find_handler() since ACE_HANDLE is an "int"
          on UNIX platforms and that causes ambiguity between
          handler(ACE_HANDLE) and handler(int).

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp (unbind):

          unbind() and bind(): Minor fixes for UNIX specific code.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.cpp:

          Added template instantiation for ACE_Auto_Array_Ptr<sockaddr_in>.

        * ace/Connector.cpp:

          cancel() and close(): Changed calls from Reactor::handler() to
          Reactor::find_handler().

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test.cpp:
        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp:

        * tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test.cpp:

          Added template instantiations.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:

          - main(): Added code to ignore SIGPIPE.

          - test(): Converted this into template class so that multiple
          instances of reactor implementation can be created.

          - Added additional asserts.

        Thu May 15 18:12:10 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor (find_handler):

          Fixed minor oversights.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:
        * ace/Connector.cpp:

          Fixed unused arg warnings.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:

          - Added a Pipe class. It is a replica of the ACE_Pipe class.
          Only difference is that this class always uses two sockets to
          create the pipe, even on platforms that support pipes.

          - Removed some test cases that don't work on Linux.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test.cpp:

        Tue May 20 18:33:07 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Connector:

          Reverted the Connector to inherit from ACE_Service_Object again.
          Even though the Connector no longer registers with the Reactor,
          it still needs to inherit from ACE_Service_Object so that it can
          be used through the Service Configurator primarily for dynamic
          linking.  The resume(), suspend(), and init() no-ops, and fini()
          and info() were restated.

        Mon Jun 30 16:31:33 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL_LIB.dsp:

          Fixed the project names - they should be:

          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Static Release"
          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Static Debug"

          instead of:

          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Release"
          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Debug"

        Wed Jul 02 15:31:33 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.cpp:

          handle_close() on the Connector was being specialized to know
          when the connection was not successful.  This is not the correct
          approach in the first place since one should look for close() on
          the service handler.  In addition, handle_close() is no longer
          used by ACE_Connector.  Therefore, I changed this to use close()
          on the service handler.

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Caching/http_handler.h:

          Included "ace/Svc_Handler.h" explicitly.

        * examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp:

          Included "ace/Test_and_Set.h" explicitly since
          ace/Timer_Queue_T.h is no longer including it.

        Thu Jun 26 17:36:13 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        Thu May 22 14:13:37 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * Merged Reactor_RefCount branch with the main truck since all ACE
          level changes are now complete.  New branch is
          Reactor_RefCount_1.

        Tue May 27 19:59:25 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * Merged Reactor_RefCount_1 branch with the main truck to avail
          new changes by Bala to the TAO connection handlers.  New branch
          is Reactor_RefCount_2.

Mon Jul  7 12:38:01 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp: Updated the implementation of all the
          dequeue_*() methods so that the "next_" and "prev_" pointer of
          the dequeue'd message block are set to 0.  Failure to do this
          can cause weird behavior when a dequeue'd message block is
          passed to ACE::write_n().... Thanks to Wenlong Tang
          <tang_long@hotmail.com> for reporting this.

Mon Jul  7 11:14:02 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_structure/any_op_cs.cpp (visit_enum):

          Fixed a cut and paste error that was causing the code generation
          for the any operators in the stub source file to be skipped. Thanks
          to <dyafe@itgil.com> for reporting the bug.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_enum/any_op_cs.cpp:

          Fixed cut and paste error in the explicit template instantiation.

          target.

Sun Jul  6 09:55:16 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Task.cpp: Fixed compile errors with MSVC 7.1 when
          ACE_HAS_ANSI_CAST  and RTTI is turned on. Thanks to Marek Brudka
          <M.Brudka@elka.pw.edu.pl> for providing the patch.

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:

          Added the TAO_RTSCHEDULER_CFLAGS flag to build RTSCheduler
          library using Borland compiler.

Fri Jul  4 07:29:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Added support for the -pipe command line option of the g++ compiler
          on Win32. This uses pipes instead of intermediate files and speeds up
          the compilation. This is enabled by default but can be disabled by
          adding pipes=0 to your platform_macros.GNU file. Thanks to
          Serge Kolgan <skolgan@trigraph.com> for this suggestion.

Thu Jul  3 22:05:58 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h:
          Moved the ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SETSTACK definition to os_pthread.h
          along with all the other pthread related definitions.  This
          should help eliminate warnings about using a the deprecated
          function pthread_attr_setstackaddr.

Thu Jul 03 17:00:47 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-doxygen.h:
          Added define of __ACE_INLINE__ so that inlining will be turned
          on in order to help identify unwanted inter-header dependencies.

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          Added include of os_stdio.h.  This picks up FILENAME_MAX on
          Windows and fixes an alignment problem with ACE_PI_Control_Block
          due to differing definitions for MAXNAMELEN.  Thanks to
          Serge Kolgan <skolgan@trigraph.com> for help figuring this out.

        * ace/QtReactor.h:
        * ace/QtReactor.cpp:

          The QtReactor works by semi-unifying the Qt Event loop with the
          Reactor event loop.  Most of the time, the Qt Event loop is the
          dominant loop, but occasionally, when wait_for_multiple_events
          gets called, the reactor loop becomes the dominant loop.

          Previous QtReactor implementations only overloaded
          register_handler, caused them to never notice when an
          application changed the mask on a previously-registered handler,
          e.g., via ACE_Reactor::schedule_wakeup.  Thus, the Qt event loop
          never knew about the new interest or lack thereof, and didn't
          call it back.

          This newer version overloads ACE_Reactor::bit_ops, and tweaks
          the registrations with the Qt event loop according to bit_ops'
          arguments' mask operations.  This *should* allow us to catch
          every twiddling of masks, although there is no comprehensive
          regression test for this for any kind of reactor.

          From inspection, it appears as if the XtReactor might need
          similar changes.

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Added ace/pre.h and ace/post.h to the exclude list.  This will
          clean up the file dependency graphs a bit and make the more
          complex ones a bit easier to read.

Thu Jun 26 01:47:03 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:

          Updated MPC with the latest features and changes from OCI's repo. Created
        new mpb base projects to make mpc files as simple as possible, and updated
        existing mpb base projects. Added and updated mpc files to use the latest
        features and make use of base projects.
          Added the create_ace_build.pl script that is more MPC friendly and works
        on Windows.
          Removed unused nightly.mwc.
          Note : The new MPC base projects will now output all library files to
        consistent locations across platforms. This is controlled by the three
        files acelib.mpb, tao_output.mpb, and orbsvcs_output.mpb using the
        libout keyword. Currently all of these are set to output to $ACE_ROOT/lib.
        All libraries will be placed in this directory, including .dll files on
        Windows. This means that Windows users will have to add %ACE_ROOT%\lib to
        their %PATH%. This is analogous to %LD_LIBRARY_PATH% on Unix.

          <dhinton@dresystems.com> which made ACE_DLL member variable a
          reference as part of subsetting, which caused

          pthread_mutex_timedlock() declaration to os_pthread.h.

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
          Added special build rule when on hpux that changes the link
          order, i.e., main.o comes before x_Test.o.  Hopefully this
          will clear up linker errors on Hp with the gcc compiler that
          started appearing after the tests directory was reorganized.

          $(CIAO_ROOT)/ciao to idlflags.

          Added $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs/orbsvcs to libpaths and linking
          Security to even a simple stub DLL because of the way
          components.idl is being set up.  (Hint: we really don't need
          them.)

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_component.mpb: Reorganized
          the template since I moved some of the libraries to ciao_client
          to fix the components.idl definition problem.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb: Added this new
          template to isolate customize CIDL rules for servant DLLs.  It
          turned out they also requires the stuff defined in the
          Deployment module (thus, the CIAO_Server library.)

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd: Added code to define
          CIAO_ROOT in Makefiles if it's not defined already.

          Thanks to Chad Elliott for helping me setting up the custom
          rules for CIDL compiler and answering my tons of questions.

           and port that is used to populate the TSpec for the
           sending_qos.

          it isn't possible, continue to use environment variables.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Push the relative() method into the ProjectCreator, where it
          should have been in the first place.

          Added the subdirectories under os_include so they'll get
          included in the documentation.

Tue Jun 24 01:25:38 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          Moved ACE_IOV_MAX and IOV_MAX defines from os_uio.h to

Mon Jun 23 12:46:05 2003  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Broke out the Naming Service flat-file persistence tests and
          added a new Redundant Naming Service test.  Both these tests
          are disabled on mininum CORBA.

Sun Jun 22 11:23:52 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Added our 1,700th contributor to ACE+TAO.  It's amazing
          how many people have contributed to these open-source projects
          since 1992!

          Removed include of OS.h and/or ACE.h from headers and adjusted
          includes in headers and other files by including appropriate
          headers in order to reduce dependencies as part of the
          subsetting effort.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/Asynch_IO.cpp:
        * ace/Asynch_IO.h:
          Changed u_long to unsigned long to help remove dependencies.
          Moved the typedef for TRANSMIT_FILE_BUFFERS here from OS.h.

        * ace/Functor.h:
        * ace/Functor.i:

        * bin/performance_stats.sh

          Added the latency tests for sequences of various data types.

Fri Jun 20 13:32:21 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (PLATFORM_SSL_CPPFLAGS):

          Some Linux OpenSSL installations compile in Kerberos support.
          Add the Kerberos include path to preprocessor include path.
          Fixes build problems on Red Hat 9 installations.  Note that this
          is an interim fix.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Switch this to be a project instead of a feature.  It doesn't hurt
          to inherit from it if you don't use the MOC_Files component.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:

          Added + and - to the escape_regex_special() method.

Fri Jun 20 09:52:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added inheritance from qt_moc and qt_reactor.  These will only be
          processed if the 'qt' feature is enabled.

        * ace/qt_reactor.mpb:

          Added QtReactor_moc.cpp to the list of files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added inheritance from the qt base project.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt.mpb:

          Contains the basic feature definition for qt libs and apps.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Contains the custom definition for MOC files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ArrayHandle.pm:

          Removed this file.  It isn't necessary anymore.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the way feature files are read.  This new way is better
          and less hacky.

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Don't modify the file if no precompiled header is found.

Fri Jun 20 14:28:12 UTC 2003  Johnny WIllemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Updated this file because of the os splitting.

Fri Jun 20 09:08:05 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Fixed the usage to display the correct options.

Fri Jun 20 08:54:29 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added code to process type specific assignments that may be
          defined within a feature.

Fri Jun 20 08:10:11 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added documentation about the new feature project type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          Defaulted the qt feature to disabled.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ArrayHandle.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          The majority of the code for handling feature project went in
          here.  One main thing that was changed is that instead of using
          the <$fh> paradigm to read files, the following is used
          $_ = $fh->getline().  This is compatible with the new ArrayHandle
          module that I added.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Options.pm:

          Added a missing space in the completion command.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the code to match some new methods added in Creator and
          ProjectCreator.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the BUILD target wouldn't be updated when the
          project had component requirements.

Thu Jun 19 12:14:31 2003  Gan Deng <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst

          Added the latency tests for sequences of various data types.

Thu Jun 19 11:36:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Updated the GNUACE template to issue information as to why a
          particular project wasn't built based on the comps, requires and
          avoids values.

Thu Jun 19 12:18:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:

          Moved include of remLib.h to os_stdio.h, and uncommented
          sysLib.h since it is needed for sysClkRateGet().  Thanks to Rod
          Andzik <andzik@rtlogic.com> for help tracking this down.

        * ace/os_include/os_netdb.h:
          Removed the VXWORKS tests for hostent and servent.

Thu Jun 19 07:50:04 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug with multiple 'specific' scopes in a single project.

Thu Jun 19 07:13:16 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Documented the existing 'specific' keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to specify multiple project types with the
          'specific' scope.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added guards around ACE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
          ACE_LD_SEARCH_PATH_SEPARATOR_STR.  Thanks to John Michael
          Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for reporting the problem.

Thu Jun 19 07:01:57 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h: Since LynxOS lacks sys/select.h and
          dlfcn.h header files, config file needs ACE_LACKS_DLFCN_H
          and ACE_LACKS_SYS_SELECT_H to be defined. Thanks to  Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for the patch.

Thu Jun 19 06:35:26 2003  John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net>

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Patches to get ACE building on OSX10.2
          again.

Thu Jun 19 00:27:38 2003  Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timeprobe.h:
        * ace/Timeprobe.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.h:

          Advanced new timeprobe. New features are a
          ring buffer for elements kept in data structure.
          This eliminates the ACE_ASSERT when an element
          is attempted to be inserted into a full data
          structure. Old data is overwritten until the
          cache is read and cleared.

          Timeprobes now include a second argument to
          allow for an ACE_ALLOCATOR. This allocator allows
          for the data structure that will contain the
          ACE_Timeprobes to be done in the constructor. A
          new function called 'increase_size' allows for
          the data structure to increase the number of
          measurements it can take. It does so by creating a
          new structure with the new size and copying the
          elements from the old structure.

        * ace/Metrics_Cache_T.i:

          Added new Metrics Cache.

        * ACE/ace/OS.h:

          Added two new macros called ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN
          and ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY. ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN
          returns an array of class pointers with their space
          preallocated and each entry initialized. If there is
          an error the value contained in RET_VAL is returned.
          ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY is the same but there is no
          return of a value if there is an error.

          sys/socket.h.

        * ace/OS.h:
          Commented out remLib.h and sysLib.h since they don't appear to
          be used by ACE at all.

        * ace/OS.h:

          For custom defined values, convert $(...) to the corresponding
          environment variable accessor, if it is required.  Custom builds
          done in the MS based IDE's are placed in a batch file and then
          executed.  For this particular case, $(...) doesn't work so we
          convert the values on assignment.

Wed Jun 18 07:38:26 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          with precompiled headers.

Tue Jun 17 14:42:25 2003  Gautam H. Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp:

          Change was necessary for build on RH 9.0 to work properly.
          Change consisted of moving the definition of IPPROTO_SCTP

          ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex and also changed the
          ACE_Condition_Thread_Mutex to
          ACE_Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.  This should fix bugs with
          deadlock.  Thanks to Thomas Groth <groth.th@nord-com.net> for
          providing these patches.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp (symbol): Added missing newlines in

            with not additions, and places all additions inside the extern
            "C" {}'s.  Rearranged some of the #ifdef's and moved includes to
            the top of the files so that only those headers that need to be
