This example illustrates the working of a Kokyu
based DSRT scheduler. There are 2 threads waiting
for requests on the server side. Two threads are
started on the client side. The main thread as
well as the worker threads are given the maximum
priority so that their "release" happen immediately.
Each of the worker threads make a remote two-way
call to the server. The two requests are processed
in different threads on the server side.

On the client side, the first thread is given lesser
priority than the second thread and the second thread
is started a little later than the first. It is
expected that, on the server side, the first request
is processed by one of the two threads. When the
second request comes in, the other thread that processes
this request should become more eligible since the
second request carries more importance than the first.
A timeline is generated which shows the sequence of
execution of the two different threads on the server.

Make sure that you run in privileged mode.

To run the test using the CV-based approach (see ../README),

./server -d
./client -d -x

To run the test using the OS-based approach (see ../README),

./server -d -s
./client -d -x -s

The timeline is generated in timeline.txt
