This example illustrates the use of the ACE_IOStream and
ACE_Streambuf_T templates to create an object based on ACE_*_Stream
classes.  These classes provide C++ iostream functionality across a
socket.

To run the tests simply build the executables in the client and server
directories and then do the following in separate windows:

# Window 1
% server/iostream_server
(10049) starting up daemon

# Window 2
% client/iostream_client
(10049) starting handler 456d0
(10049) Client sent:
        (1) (2.3)
(10051) Server sent:
        (1) (2.3)
(10049) connection closed
(10049) shutting down handler 456d0
(10049) shutting down server daemon
