Mon Mar 24 22:05:56 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/Default_Constants.h: Added a const value for the connector's
	  map size. 
	* ace/Connector.cpp: Used the constant value to configure the
	  internal map. Too large a map doesnt help with run-time
	  footprint. 

Mon Mar 24 18:06:49 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.pl: Modified the script to do the following

	  - Added an option to run only TAO tests in $TAO_ROOT/tests. 
	  - Instead of reading just one file for all the tests and
	    examples in our daily builds, we will now use 3 files. One of
	    the files is for ACE tests, one for tests in TAO and the last
	    one is for all the other tests and examples in TAO. 

	  This provides various flexibilities for a poor developer like
	  yours truly, to just build and run all the tests in TAO/tests
	  after making changes to the ORB Core. It helps automating some
	  development work. We could also take this to our daily
	  builds. We will see more of this over a period of time. 

	  The changes should be backward compatible and shouldnt break any
	  of the existing builds. 
	  
	* bin/ace_tests.lst:
	* bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
	* bin/tao_other_tests.lst: New configuration files for ACE+TAO
	  tests. We will use only this to add new tests to ACE+TAO.

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Removed this file from the repo. 

Mon Mar 24 10:23:08 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_Context.h:

	  No longer any need to include "ace/Singleton.h" due to the below
	  change.

	From David Kinder <david.kinder@sophos.com>
	* ace/SSL/SSL_Context.inl (instance):
	* ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp (instance):

	  Uninlined this method.  Fixes a problem found in Win32 "release"
	  builds where an application could end up with multiple
	  ACE_SSL_Context singleton instances.  [Bug 1475]

Mon Mar 24 18:03:34 CET 2003  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* ace/Unbounded_Set.{h,cpp}:

	  Added method const_iterator_leave() in class ACE_Unbounded_Set.
	  The destructor of the ACE_Unbounded_Set_Const_Iterator calls
	  it. Deleted elements are not cleaned up in that case, but they
	  probably don't need to, given that we are dealing with a "const"
	  set.

	  Thanks to Jeff Parsons for noticing the problem.

Mon Mar 24 06:54:55 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-linux-common.h: Change the ACE_DEFAULT_BASE_ADDR for
	  the IA-64 from 0x8 to 0x0 so the Linux kernel can choose the
 	  right value.  Thanks to Sergei Pimenov
 	  <sergei.pimenov@intel.com> for reporting this.

Mon Mar 24 13:16:29 CET 2003  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* ace/Node.{h,cpp}:
	* ace/Unbounded_Set.{h,inl,cpp}:

	  Fix for Bugzilla bug 1460 supplied by Rudolf Weber
	  <rfweber@tesionmail.de>, adds a `deleted' flag to ACE_Node, and
	  adds corresponding management methods to ACE_Unbounded_Set.

	* tests/Unbounded_Set_Test.{cpp,icc}: New.

	* tests/Makefile, tests/Makefile.{am,bor}:
	  Add Unbounded_Set_Test.cpp, a regression test for bug 1460.

Sat Mar 22 11:58:12 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Configuration.cpp: When remove_section() was called the
	  buckets created for the value and section hash map were not
	  deleted.  Added two new lines after
	  if (index_->unbind (SectionExtId, allocator_))
	    return -1;

          as follows:

	  value_hash_map->close();
	  section_entry->int_id_.section_hash_map_->close(allocator_);

          Thanks to Sandip Patel <spatel@pwcwireless.com> for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp: Moved the notify() hook calls within
	  the protection of the guard lock critical section to prevent
 	  race conditions on cleanup.  Thanks to Ron Muck <rlm@sdiusa.com>
	  for this suggestion.

Fri Mar 21 13:07:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a -base option to allow a user to specify multiple base
          projects to be applied toward all generated project files.

Fri Mar 21 10:42:41 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Factored assignment processing from ProjectCreator into Creator.
          Factored convert_slashes() from ProjectCreator into Parser.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Options.pm:

          Factored option processing from Driver into a new module, Options.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added support for workspace specific assignments.  Currently the
          only valid assignment is 'cmdline' which allows mwc to apply
          command line options to a specific set of mpc files.

Fri Mar 21 09:48:33 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Added the -static_only option back in to allow generation of
          static projects only.

Thu Mar 20 19:50:36 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.i (ACE_OS::recursive_mutex_cond_unlock): If on WinCE, don't
          do the check for RecursionCount; WinCE's structure doesn't have that
          member. Also see:
          Sat Mar 15 10:55:01 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt

Thu Mar 20 17:51:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd: Only output a linker
          /entry option if building a DLL. Let binary programs pick up the
          correct entrypoint from the subsystem type. It defaults to windowsce,
          requiring WinMainCRTStartup.

Thu Mar 20 14:11:01 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Codecs.cpp (encode, decode):

          Fixed "comparison is always false due to limited range of data
          type" warning by removing those comparisons and accompanying
          code.

Thu Mar 20 14:00:53 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp (find_seg):

          Fixed overflow in pointer arithmetic on platforms where
          sizeof(void*) is greater than sizeof(off_t).  This also fixes a
          "cast from pointer to integer of different size" warning.

Thu Mar 20 12:56:26 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test.cpp:

          Fixed unused variable warning in single-threaded builds.

Thu Mar 20 12:35:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added a new keyword lit_libs that is identical to libs except that
          with windows build tools, a library modified (s,d,sd) is not
          added to the library name.

Thu Mar 20 11:23:46 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the default behavior for naming workspaces and projects.
          They now use the name of the mwc and mpc file respectively.

Thu Mar 20 07:23:48 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Removed -dynamic_only and -static_only options and made "dynamic
          only" the default.  I added a -static option that will allow the
          user to generate static projects in addition to dynamic projects.

Thu Mar 20 07:09:54 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp: The wrong remove_handler() method was
          being used in the ACE_Process_Manager::close() method.  Changed
          this to use the remove_handler() that removes the SIGCHLD
          handler.  Thanks to Carsten Prescher
          <carsten.prescher@sysde.eads.net> for this fix.

Wed Mar 19 12:08:31 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_irix6.x_sgic++.GNU:

          Suppress warning numbers 1253,3439,1234 and 3506.

Wed Mar 19 07:27:59 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Added depend, idl_stubs and realclean targets.

Tue Mar 18 07:24:26 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          If files are listed in "Template_Files" and "Source_Files" is
          omitted, then "Source_Files" could have duplicated values from
          "Template_Files".  A new method has been added to correct this
          situation.

Mon Mar 17 17:38:05 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU: The GNU file can now
          work with 64 bit intel compiler in Itanium. Thanks to Lubomir
          Bulej <lubomir.bulej@mff.cuni.cz> and Petr Tuma
          <petr.tuma@mff.cuni.cz> for providing the patches.

Mon Mar 17 19:20:54 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:
          Set threads to 0 when it is not defined yet. From the Cygwin daily
          build we found that threading is just partly enabled with Cygwin.
          First tries to enable it completely resulted in a lot of new errors,
          so for the time being disable threads by default and then start
          working on getting everything working with threading enabled.
          Also removed setting of optimized and the --enable-auto-import
          because they are not needed.

Mon Mar 17 09:58:48 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Updated the project to include the correct template, inline and
          header files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the defaults for precompiled headers.  If multiple pch
          headers are found, then take the one closest to the project name.

Sun Mar 16 10:12:12 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i (recursive_mutex_cond_unlock): Fixed typo

Sat Mar 15 13:50:18 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc: Added Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test.

Sat Mar 15 12:20:45 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test.dsp: Added a new project file.

Sat Mar 15 10:55:01 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Makefile:
        * tests/Makefile.bor:
        * tests/run_test.lst: Added Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test.cpp to
          these files.

        * tests: Added a new Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test.cpp to check
          that the fix from Leonid Kvetnyi is correct and doesn't cause
          other problems.

        * tests/Recursive_Condition_Test.cpp (ACE_TMAIN): Minor reformatting.

        * ace/OS.i (recursive_mutex_cond_unlock): Added another check for
          m->RecursionCount > 1 to fix problems where the test program hangs.
          Thanks to Leonid Kvetnyi <leonidk@nice.com> for this fix.

        * ace/Event_Handler_T.h: Changed

          typedef int (T::*SIG_HANDLER) (ACE_HANDLE, siginfo_t*, ucontext_t*);

          to this

          typedef int (T::*SIG_HANDLER) (int, siginfo_t*, ucontext_t*);

          so that we're consistent across platforms where ACE_HANDLE is a
          HANDLE, not an int!  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for reporting this.

Fri Mar 14 22:26:56 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_component.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_server.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm: Merged in CIAO
          specific rules and default environment settings.  These changes
          help me take advantage of Chad's and other's work without
          complicating my workspace.  Most of other CIAO stuff are rather
          localized.

          These changes have no effect on others whatsoever.

Fri Mar 14 11:49:27 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Cached_Allocator_Test.cpp: Fix access out-of-bounds error.
          Thanks to Alexander Libman <alexl@aurema.com> for this fix.

Thu Mar 13 16:11:48 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log_hexdump):
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:

          Use the ACE_SIZE_T_FORMAT_SPECIFIER macro to specify the correct
          size_t format specifier.  Fixes a warning exhibited on 32-bit
          and 64-bit g++ builds.

Thu Mar 13 17:35:48 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv1/Logging_Handler.cpp (recv_log_record):
        * examples/C++NPv2/Logging_Handler.cpp (recv_log_record): Use
          ACE_CDR::grow(), not ACE_Message_Block::size(), to resize the
          CDR-receiving block. This maintains alignment across the resize.
          Thanks to Don Hinton for this fix.

          Committing Justin Michel's <michel_j@ociweb.com> modifications to
          the intermediate directory to allow multiple projects within a
          single directory that use the same source files.  This also has
          the side of organizing the generated object files into separate
          project directories underneath the main intermediate directory.

          Fixed output directories for executables.  Executables of
          different configurations now go into different directories.
          Also, we need to always generate pdb information for executables.

Wed Mar 12 08:59:18 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log_hexdump):
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:

          Another round of format specifier corrections.  "%lu" instead of
          "%u".  Addresses warnings in 64 bit platform builds.

Wed Mar 12 10:42:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where header and inline files would be added to a

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a -recurse option and fixed a problem with changing
          to non-existent directories.

Mon Mar 10 18:10:31 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ARGV.h: Clarified the behavior of ACE_ARGV's behavior with
          respect to environment variable substitution; it only substitutes
          when the token is itself an environment variable reference and not
          if there's an environment variable reference contained within the
          token. e.g. $HOME will subtitute, $HOME/file will not.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factor out code to detect duplicate project names to allow the
          WorkspaceCreator to use that same code to detect duplicate
          workspace names.

Mon Mar 10 13:30:30 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          If an mpc file contains projects with duplicate names, MPC will
          issue a warning to that effect.

Mon Mar 10 08:25:30 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log_hexdump):
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:

          Corrected format specifier for size_t (unsigned integer)
          variable, i.e. "%u" instead of "%d".  Fixes mismatched format
          specifier warnings.

Mon Mar 10 07:36:59 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where multiple uses of a $() variable would not be
          handled correctly with the -relative option.  Thanks to Nanbor
          Wang for reporting this.

Mon Mar 10 13:47:08 CET 2003  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Cannot use CXX to determine compiler version because CXX might be
          set to "insure" and insure does not pass the -dumpversion option
          to the compiler.

Sun Mar  9 10:17:16 2003  Edan Ayal <edanayal@yahoo.com>

        * tests/Future_Set_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Future_Test.cpp:

          Printing order should be 'a,b,c,d,e' instead of 'a,b,c,e,d'.

          First sleep() replaced with
          ACE_Thread_Manager::instance()->wait().

          Final sleep() is redundant, as the spawned threads are already
          dead.

          Prime_Scheduler::close() is called twice - once by the user
          (asking to close the task) and once by the framework, when the
          thread exists.  This causes the task_count counter to be
          negative.

          Renamed the method to 'shutdown'.  Change method declaration and
          definition (remove 'virtual' and all the arguments).  Change the
          call in Method_Request_end::call to shutdown() instead of
          close()

          In the future set test, place different name commands in the
          name set, just to show that it can be done.

Sat Mar  8 12:54:18 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Get_Opt.h: Clarified the role of the long_only argument for
          the ACE_Get_Opt constructor.

Fri Mar  7 09:58:06 2003  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * apps/mkcsregdb/Makefile: Fixed the install location so the
          make succeeds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Reverted my change from "Fri Mar  7 06:35:09 2003  Chad Elliott"
          to Parser.pm and factored out code from that module and Driver
          into a new module, StringProcessor.pm.  Driver and Parser now
          inherit from StringProcessor.

          Added mpc files for ACEXML related projects.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acexml.mpb:

          Added an acexml base project to provide easy addition of ACEXML
          libraries to a project.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed the code to find the main() in a .cpp.

Fri Mar  7 06:35:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:

          Fixed a bug introduced with the
          "Thu Mar  6 08:06:35 2003  Chad Elliott" modification of
          Driver.pm.  I made $cwd part of the class instead of a static
          local.  The value wasn't being updated properly since Driver.pm
          now "uses" Parser.  Thanks to Steve Huston for bringing this to my
          attention.

Thu Mar  6 18:14:21 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Rather than do the
          template closure as part of the AR command, set up PRELIB to do
          template closure; this allows static libs to build clean with the
          xargs method introduced to rules.lib.GNU. A side-affect of this
          is that the separate template closure step is also used for
          shared libraries, and thus, +inst_none needed to be added to
          SOFLAGS.
          Also set AR to /usr/ccs/bin/ar to be sure to pick up the native
          HP-supplied ar command.

        * examples/C++NPv1/Process_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp: Don't
          reinterpret_cast on non-Windows. Not needed and aC++ complains.
          Also see:

Thu Mar  6 14:49:37 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/mkcsregdb/mkcsregdb.cpp: const_cast pointers that need to be
          delete[]-ed sp MSVC 6 doesn't complain. static_cast result of
          strtol() to ACE_CDR::UShort when needed.

Thu Mar  6 10:56:09 2003  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am: Adding codeset files to yet another makefile
          variant.

          Added support for nmake on Win64.  To generate nmake files use the
          following command line:

          mwc.pl -type nmake -value_template platforms=Win64

Thu Mar  6 08:06:35 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Added an environment variable that allows users to set default
          command line parameters.  The MPC_COMMANDLINE environment variable
          is added to the command line parameters.  It will not override any
          arguments passed in.

Wed Mar  5 21:45:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (get_port_number_from_name): Correct arg name
          for ACE_UNUSED_ARG. Suspected cut/paste error.

        * tests/ACE_Test.cpp: const_cast the pointers returned from
          ACE::execname() so they can be deleted on MSVC6.

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

Wed Mar  5 06:10:48 2003  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

       * ace/Makefile.bor:

         Added codeset registry files to makefile.

Tue Mar 04 19:58:29 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/common/FileCharStream.cpp (determine_encoding): Commented
          out the annoying debug information.  Users should get the
          encoding information from this->getEncoding(), instead of
          relying on the debug info.

        * ACEXML/common/LocatorImpl.cpp (reset): Remember to reset string
          pointers to 0 after deleteing them.  Otherwise, a parser may
          crash if it is used to parse a second file.

Tue Mar  4 17:39:31 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * docs/CE-status.txt: Updated to reflect the ACE 5.3 status of CE.

        * ace/ACE.cpp (execname): Try to locate ".exe" suffix without
          case sensitivity. Thanks to Kelly F. Hickel <kfh@mqsoftware.com>
          for reporting this. Also, when appending a suffix, append it to
          the name, not after the name's nul terminator.

        * ace/ACE.h: Clarified that the pointer returned, if allocated, is
          allocated using new[] and should be freed with delete[].

        * tests/ACE_Test.cpp:
        * tests/ACE_Test.dsp: New test for ACE methods. At this time, it tests
          the ACE::execname() method fixed above.

        * tests/Makefile:
        * tests/Makefile.bor:
        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

Tue Mar  4 13:54:52 2003  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Codeset_Registry.cpp:
        * ace/Codeset_Registry.h:
        * ace/Codeset_Registry.inl:

          New files added to support the codeset framework. The Codeset
          Registry is either a wrapper for dce code and character set
          registry functions, if the system supports them, or these
          fucntions are emulated. Only the functions necessary to support
          TAO's Codeset translation framework are emulated.

        * ace/Codeset_Registry_db.cpp:

        The codeset "database." A minimal list (2 entries) is shipped, see
        apps/mkcsregdb to build a new list of supported codesets as needed.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:

        Changed the interface on the ACE_[W]Char_Codeset_Translator class for
        the read_[w]char_array to take a non-const array as the out parameter.

        * ace/Makefile.ace:
        * ace/ace.mpc:

        Added the new codeset files to the makefile.

        * apps/mkcsregdb:

        A new application used to generate custom list of codeset identites.
        The description of how to run is in a comment at the top of
        ace/Codeset_Registry_db.cpp.

Tue Jan 24 17:50:32 2003  Gonzalo Diethelm  <gonzalo.diethelm@aditiva.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
          Method string_to_addr() now uses ACE_OS_String::strtol() instead
          of the ugly hack using ACE_OS::strspn() and ACE_OS::atoi().  The
          two set() methods that receive a const char port_name[] now try
          first to parse that port_name as a simple number (like "901"),
          and if that fails they try to resolve the port name as a
          service.  In order to implement this, I added a static helper
          function called get_port_number_from_name() (sorry for the awful
          name).

Tue Mar  4 12:53:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          If no exe target or lib target is supplied, then search the source
          files for a main() and set the exename.

Tue Mar  4 09:31:01 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Configuration.cpp:

          For temporary ACE_TStrings used internally, switched to the
          non-allocating constructor. Also made cosmetic changes and
          changed some ACE_TString assignments to use the nocopy
          assignment method added below.

        * ace/String_Base.h:
        * ace/String_Base.i:

          Added a nocopy assignment method.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

          Added Unbounded_Queue.h to the project.

Mon Mar  3 11:39:20 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Strategies_T.h:

          Forward declare ACE_Service_Repository.  Fixes a problem exposed
          by IBM Visual Age C++ 5 builds about unexpected text.

Fri Feb 28 17:43:02 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Manager.h (ACE_Service_Manager): Changed private to
          protected.  Thanks to Terry Mihm <terrym@firstlogic.com> for
          suggesting this.

Fri Feb 28 13:04:56 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        Changes necessitated by inter-header dependency reductions.

        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-acceptor.h:

          Include "ace/Svc_Handler.h" to pull in ACE_Svc_Handler template

        * bin/ChangeLogEditor/FileLocator.pm:
        * bin/cle.pl:

          Added a ChangeLog editor script.  It uses CVS to determine which
          files have been modified, added or removed and generates a blank
          ChangeLog entry in the existing ChangeLog.

Fri Feb 28 13:18:17 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a problem with project dependencies.  If the project
          dependency is not a project within the generated solution, then
          omit it.

Fri Feb 28 07:49:00 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:

          Pulled the common code out of Creator and replaced it with a
          template method to collect the lines with possible line
          continuation.

Fri Feb 28 12:33:01 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SString.cpp:
          Also do the explicit template instantiations
          ACE_String_Base<char>::NULL_String_ and
          ACE_String_Base<ACE_WSTRING_TYPE>::NULL_String_ when using VxWorks.

Thu Feb 27 10:56:01 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Proactor_Scatter_Gather_Test.cpp (initiate_read_file):

          Explicitly cast return value of ceil() to "size_t".  Fixes a
          "loss of data" warning.  Loss of data isn't an issue in this
          case.

Thu Feb 27 10:53:38 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.cpp (single_cpu_exchange, multi_cpu_exchange):

          workspace.

Thu Feb 27 10:31:44 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU: The GNU file can now
          work with 64 bit intel compiler in Itanium. Thanks to Lubomir
          Bulej <lubomir.bulej@mff.cuni.cz> and Petr Tuma
          <petr.tuma@mff.cuni.cz> for providing the patches.

Thu Feb 27 10:22:05 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Synch.h:
        * ace/Synch.i: Added ACE_Null_Condition::wait (ACE_Null_Mutex &m,
          const ACE_Time_Value * = 0) which seems to be missing.

Wed Feb 26 18:42:33 2003  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ace/Makefile.bor:

          Removed ACE_LD_DECORATOR_STR definition from CFLAGS, as this
          macro is now defined by the common included makefiles.

        * ace/Synch.h:

          Added missing constructor overload and disown member function
          to the ACE_Guard<ACE_Null_Mutex> template specialization.

        * ace/Atomic_Op.cpp:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.i:
        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:

          Use InterlockedExchange (or the XCHG instruction) to provide
          strong memory-ordering when assigning to an atomic integer.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/Creator.pm:

          Added support for line continuation using backslash in .mpc files.

          Added POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp to the Demux files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Modification to allow users to name the foreach variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the defaulting behavior if neither exename, sharedname or
          staticname are defined in an mpc file.

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp:
        * ace/PI_Malloc.cpp:
        * ace/PI_Malloc.h:

          Teach ACE_Control_Block and friends to do alignment on 64-bit
          platforms. The previous code was buggy and caused a lot of bus
          errors on platforms with greater than 4-byte alignment. We no
          longer multiply and divide by sizeof (long) and do the alignment
          based on sizeof (union ACE_max_align_info). This change also
          makes the default alignment to be at 8-byte boundary (which is
          ofcourse overridable) and errs in favour of safe code by default
          vs optimization for code size. This should get rid of bug
          reports on SGI IRIX, Solaris 64-bit etc related to
          ACE_*_Allocator and friends.

          Also fixed a couple of rounding errors which result in core
          dumps, in ACE_Cached_Allocator and ACE_Dynamic_Cached_Allocator
          where we happily traverse memory irrespective of alignment of
          the chunk_size.

          Thanks to Dave Mercer <mercer@itgssi.com> for reporting the
          problem.

          One of the items from the long list of pending items post-5.3.1.

        * ace/OS_Memory.h:

          Removed the definition of ACE_MALLOC_ALIGN from this file.
          ACE_MALLOC_ALIGN is an internal definition of Malloc.h and
          should have no business in OS_Memory.h.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Use echo on VLOBJS instead of find with *.o. This fixes build
          problems on lame platforms like MacOS X  where ar doesn't
          generate an index and need to use ranlib. Probably the right
          thing to do even otherwise since there might be more objects in
          .{sh,}obj than needed for a library.

Tue Feb 25 10:00:54 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (LongLong):
        * ace/CDR_Base.inl:
        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp:

          Removed newly added 32-bit assignment and comparison operators.
          Comparison is non-trivial in this signed case, and assignment
          operators are a potential source of confusion when implicit
          conversions are performed.  This change basically reverts
          ACE_CDR::LongLong to its previous implementation, and also
          addresses some build problems on platforms with non-native 64
          bit signed integers (e.g. VxWorks).

Tue Feb 25 08:09:13 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Atomic_Op_T.h (mutex_):

          Removed "mutable" keyword from this reference member.  IBM's
          Visual Age C++ considers mutable reference members invalid.

        * ace/Atomic_Op_T.i:

          Go back to casting away the const-ness of the above mutex
          reference member in const methods.

Tue Feb 25 09:57:07 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

Tue Feb 25 09:24:06 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp: Added an emulation for localtime_r() for WinCE.  Thanks to
          Martin Brown <mpatalberta@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 25 08:40:12 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Always generate a realclean target, but only add idl generated
          files if we had idl_files to work with.

Tue Feb 25 07:56:59 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Updated the documentation to reflect the removal of the 3
          character restriction on type names.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/avstreamsexe.mpb:

          Inherit from namingexe instead of reproducing the same
          information.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventexe.mpb:

          Inherit from server instead of reproducing the same information.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Removed the restriction of a 3 character type.

          Made modifications to these modules to allow an mwc file to have
          multiple workspaces defined within it.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Cosmetic change.

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Added a new project type for generic Makefiles.  These are not
          suitable for use within ACE or TAO, but may be useful to someone.

Mon Feb 24 15:37:06 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TTY_IO.h (ACE_TTY_IO): Added the dtrdisable member to
          Serial_Params.  This finishes a fix suggested by Ray Limpus
          <ray.limpus@boeing.com>.  Thanks to Jeff Parsons for noticing
          this.

Mon Feb 24 08:53:52 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.i (operator++, operator--):

          Fixed incorrect dereferencing of non-pointer return variable.

Sun Feb 23 12:16:34 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (cancel): Added support for cancel() on
          MinGW.  Thanks to Vince for this fix.

        * examples/Mem_Map/Makefile: Moved the definition of DIRS to
          later in the Makefile so we can exclude it from the MinGW
          build.  Thanks to Vince for reporting this, as well.

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.cpp (close): Make sure to check whether
          GetQueuedQueuedCompletion() returns false.  Thanks to Vince
          Mounts <vince@mounts.cc> for reporting this.

Sat Feb 22 08:16:36 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h (operator++, operator--):

          Fixed return type mismatch between declaration and definition in
          Basic_Types.i.

Fri Feb 21 22:21:49 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.i: Removed the #if !defined (ACE_HAS_WINCE) around the
          ACE_OS::vsprintf() method. It's available on CE. Thanks to
          Emmanuel Thevenot Beaufort <emmanuel.thevenot-beaufort@jci.com>
          for this fix.

          Also enabled ACE_OS::fgets(), fflush(), thr_getspecific() similarly.

Fri Feb 21 12:52:00 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
        * ace/OS.h:

          Moved ACE_CORBA_{1,2,3} and ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro out of OS.h
          and into Global_Macros.h.  Helps avoid inclusion of OS.h in some
          cases.

Fri Feb 21 10:05:23 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp:

          Include "ace/Auto_Ptr.h" once again to pull in the
          ACE_Auto_Basic_Array_Ptr class declaration.  Fixes compile-time
          problems on AIX about unknown template types.

Fri Feb 21 13:32:43 2003  Edward Scott  <eas@prismtechnologies.com>

        * docs/bugzilla-build-setup.html:

          Removed obsolete documentation file. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for reporting the problem.

Fri Feb 21 06:18:19 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Framework_Component_DLL.cpp:

          Include "ace/Service_Object.h" to pull in ACE_Service_Object
          class declaration.  Necessitated by inter-header dependency
          reductions.

Thu Feb 20 18:54:03 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/gatewayd.cpp:

          Include "ace/Service_Object.h" to pull in ACE_Service_Object_Ptr
          class declaration.  Necessitated by inter-header dependency
          reductions.

Thu Feb 20 18:49:37 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/Timer_Service.h:

          Include "ace/Service_Object.h" to pull in ACE_Service_Object
          class declaration.  Necessitated by inter-header dependency
          reductions.

Thu Feb 20 18:45:29 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * examples/C++NPv2/Service_Reporter.cpp:

          Include "ace/Service_Types.h" to pull in ACE_Service_Type_Impl
          class declaration.  Necessitated by inter-header dependency
          reductions.

Thu Feb 20 18:31:10 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:

          Fixed "lose of const in cast" errors.

Thu Feb 20 18:20:19 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.h (ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor):

          Reverted the change that made this class inherit privately from
          ACE_SSL_SOCK instead of publically.  While this isn't strictly
          the correct thing to do, IMO, it does correct some compile-time
          problems.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):

          Fixed compile-time error related to violation of a const
          qualifier on a pointer to the timeout value.

Thu Feb 20 19:18:17 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-02b:
        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-03a: New files having all the old ChangeLog
          entries till 5.3.1.
        * ChangeLog: Shortened the changelog for ease of use.

Thu Feb 20 10:35:15 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Strategies_T.h:
        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:

          Reverted part of changes that introduced extensive use of
          traits since they were forcing the introduction of the
          ACE_TYPENAME macro in more places than is desirable at this
          point in time.  They may be reintroduced in the future.

Thu Feb 20 09:24:00 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:

          Forward declare ACE_Service_Object.  Necessitated by inter-header
          dependency reductions.

Thu Feb 20 09:23:51 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Acceptor.h:
        * ace/Connector.h:

          No need to include "ace/Service_Config.h" and
          "ace/Svc_Handler.h".

          Include "ace/Synch_Options.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
          dependency reductions.

        * ace/Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/Connector.cpp:

          Include "ace/Svc_Handler.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
          dependency reductions.

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:

          Fixed doxygen documentation.

        * ace/Atomic_Op.i (operator++, operator--):

          Implement these post{in,de}crement operators in terms of their
          corresponding pre{in,de}crement operators to ensure consistent
          semantics.

        * ace/Atomic_Op_T.h (mutex_, own_mutex_):

          Improved const-correctness by making these mutex members
          mutable.  This allows us to avoid casting away the constness.

        * ace/Atomic_Op_T.i (operator==, operator>=, operator>):
          (operator<=, operator<, value, operator=):

          Do not cast away the constness of the mutex.  That hack is no
          longer necessary since the mutex is now mutable.

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Improved doxygen documentation.

          Moved endianness determination macros prior to ACE_U_LongLong
          class.

          (operator=):

          Added ACE_ULongLong assignment operator declarations that accept
          32 bit signed and unsigned integers.

          (operator++, operator--):

          Added missing ACE_ULongLong post{in,de}crement operator
          declarations.

          (data_):

          Make declaration order of lower and upper 32 bit members (lo_
          and hi_) of this structure dependant on the endianness of the
          platform.  This mimics what is done for the ACE_LongLong type
          in the ACE_CDR classes.

        * ace/Basic_Types.i (operator=):

          Added ACE_ULongLong assignment operator implementation that
          accept 32 bit signed and unsigned integers.

          (operator++, operator--):

          Added missing ACE_ULongLong post{in,de}crement operator
          implementations.

        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp (mb_align):

          Uninlined this method in order to reduce inter-header
          dependencies.

          (operator<, operator<=, operator>, operator>=, operator==):
          (operator!=):

          Added these missing operator for the ACE_LongLong type.

          (Float, operator=, operator!=):

          Fixed potential unused argument warnings for the Cray/UNICOS
          case.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          Include "ace/OS.h" instead of "ace/Message_Block.h", and forward
          declare ACE_Message_Block in order to reduce inter-header
          dependencies.

          Changed all uses of typedefs like "u_char" and "u_long" to their
          non-typedef counterparts, e.g. "unsigned char" and "unsigned
          long".  Makes it possible to avoid including headers that
          contain those typedefs.

          (operator=):

          Added ACE_LongLong constructors assignment operators that accept
          32-bit integers.

          (operator==, operator!=, operator<=, operator<, operator>=):
          (operator>):

          Added these missing ACE_LongLong relation operators.

        * ace/CDR_Base.inl (operator=):

          Added ACE_LongLong constructors assignment operators that accept
          32-bit integers.

          (operator==, operator!=, operator<=, operator<, operator>=):
          (operator>):

          Added these missing ACE_LongLong relation operators.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:

          Moved definition of the ACE_CDR_BYTE_ORDER macros from OS.h to
          this header.  Helps with header dependency reduction.

        * ace/Capabilities.h:

          Use ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex instead of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager.
          Doing so saves us three template instantiations.

        * ace/Capabilities.i:

          Cosmetic changes.

        * ace/Capabilities.cpp:

          No need to include "ace/Map_Manager.h".

          Added missing ACE_RCSID macro.

          Improved conformance to ACE coding conventions.

          Removed explicit template instantiations for the
          ACE_Hash_Map_Manager template.  That template is no longer
          used.

          (reset_caps):

          Use ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex template traits instead of the
          actual template type.  Makes for cleaner code.

        * ace/Configuration.cpp:
        * ace/Configuration.h:
        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
        * ace/Token_Collection.cpp:

        * ace/Token_Manager.h:
        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp:
        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:

          Take advantage of template traits to improve clarity of code.

        * ace/Copy_Disabled.h:

          Corrected comment.

        * ace/Default_Constants.h:

          Moved ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_BUFSIZE, ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_EXP_GROWTH_MAX,
          ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_LINEAR_GROWTH_CHUNK,
          ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_MEMCPY_TRADEOFF macros from OS.h to this
          header.  Helps with inter-header dependency reduction.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:
        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Include "ace/Service_Types.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
          dependency reduction.

        * ace/Filecache.h:
        * ace/Filecache.cpp:
        * ace/Hash_Map_With_Allocator_T.h:
        * ace/Hash_Map_With_Allocator_T.cpp:
        * ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h:
        * ace/Local_Name_Space.cpp:

          Use ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex instead of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager.
          Doing so saves us three template instantiations.

        * ace/Future_Set.h:
        * ace/Map_T.h:

          Include "ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h" instead of
          "ace/Hash_Map_Manager.h".  The former is all that is needed, and
          the latter already includes the former.

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.i (operator++, operator--):
        * ace/Map_Manager.i:
        * ace/RB_Tree.i:

          Implement the post-{in,de}crement operators in terms of their
          pre-{in,de}crement operator counterparts to ensure consistency.

        * ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp:

          No need to include "ace/Auto_Ptr.h"

          Use template traits to improve code clarity.

        * ace/OS.h:

          Moved ACE_CDR_BYTE_ORDER macro definition to CDR_Stream.h.
          Helps with inter-header dependencies.

          Moved ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_BUFSIZE, ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_EXP_GROWTH_MAX,
          ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_LINEAR_GROWTH_CHUNK,
          ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_MEMCPY_TRADEOFF to Default_Constants.h.  Helps
          with inter-header dependency reduction.

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp:

          Added missing ACE_RCSID macro.

          (bytes_transferred):
          Use map template traits to improve code clarity.

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.h:

          Redefined old map typedefs in terms of the map traits.

        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/Service_Repository.h:

          No need to include "ace/Service_Types.h".  A forward declaration
          for ACE_Service_Types is enough.

        * ace/Service_Config.h:

          No need to include "ace/Service_Types.h" and "ace/Signal.h".
          Forward declaring ACE_Service_Types and ACE_Sig_Adapter is
          enough.

        * ace/Strategies_T.h:

          No need to include "ace/Service_Config.h" and
          "ace/Synch_Options.h".

        * ace/Synch_Options.h:

          Changed all uses of typedefs like "u_char" and "u_long" to their
          non-typedef counterparts, e.g. "unsigned char" and "unsigned
          long".  Makes it possible to avoid including OS.h.  A big win in
          compile time reduction.

          Include "ace/Time_Value.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
          dependency reduction.

        * ace/Synch_Options.cpp:

          Changed all uses of typedefs like "u_char" and "u_long" to their
          non-typedef counterparts, e.g. "unsigned char" and "unsigned
          long".  Makes it possible to avoid including OS.h.  A big win in
          compile time reduction.

          Include "ace/Trace.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
          dependency reduction.

        * ace/Template_Instantiations.cpp:

          Removed all ACE_Hash_Map_Manager related template
          instantiations.  The ones for ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex are all
          that are needed.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.h (ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor):

          Inherit privately from ACE_SSL_SOCK, instead of publically.
          ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor is IMPLEMENTED-IN-TERMS-OF ACE_SSL_SOCK.
          It does not satisfy the IS-A relationship.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):

          Use ACE_Countdown_Time to take into account the time between
          each call to select() instead of using the same timeout value in
          each loop iteration.  [Bug 1110]

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (get_remote_addr):

          Retrieve the remote addr from the parent ACE_SSL_SOCK class, not
          ACE_SOCK.  Addresses potential inconsistencies in the future.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.h (ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream):

          Removed friend declarations for the
          ACE_SSL_SOCK_{Acceptor,Connector} classes.  They are
          unnecessary.

        * examples/C++NPv1/Process_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp:
          In run_worker(), use ACE_reinterpret_cast, not ACE_static_cast,
          to convert an int to an ACE_HANDLE. Thanks to Vince Mounts
          <vince@mounts.cc> for reporting this.

        * ace/Bound_Ptr.{h,i}: Made the get() method const.  Thanks to
          Chris Kohlhoff for reporting this.
