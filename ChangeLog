          Changes mainly to correct problems with MPC files
          generated for non-component builds, i.e., from some IDL
          file used in common by multiple component builds, such
          as the definition of a port interface. Also made changes
          and added a new command line option to help minimize the
          amount of code generated from IDL and minimize the
          dependencies of the generated makefile or project.

Wed Nov 29 15:43:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Added comments about more details which are not compliant according
          to the spec

        * DAnCE/DomainApplicationManager/Deployment_Configuration.cpp:

Tue Nov 28 10:42:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/*:
        * *:
          Renamed a lot of idl files, if the file contains interfaces/types
          from the DAnCE spec, added Deployment_ as prefix, if they are
          containing CIAO specific interfaces, added CIAO_. This way we can
          more easily see if we have spec compliant IDL or not.

        * ciao/Security.idl:
          CIAO uses an interface of the security service but we don't
          do a thing with it, so just define a local interface within
          CIAO and use that for the moment, saves 250Kb of footprint

          Use the local security interface

        * ciao/CCM_Home.idl:
        * ciao/CCM_Object.idl:
          Moved CCMHome again to its own file now the idl compiler has
          been fixed to handle this correctly

        * ciao/Dynamic_Component_Servant_Base.h:
          Removed the character c from the first line which drove the
          compilers really crazy

        * ciao/CCM_Home.idl:
        * ciao/CCM_Object.idl:
          Moved CCMHome to CCMObject, when these are in seperate files
          the generated code for components is not correct. We want to have
          these interfaces in seperate files but we can sort out this
          later.

          Fixed pragme once warning

          Splitted the huge idl files into smaller parts. The CCM files are almost done,
          the Deployment files do need some more iterations to get smaller files that
          contain an interface with the types they need. This way the linker can optimize
          objects out during a static compilation

        * ciao/CIAO_Value.idl:
        * ciao/Container_Base.pidl:
          Removed, not used at all

        * ciao/ComponentsC.h:
        * ciao/ComponentsS.h:
          Removed, will be generated by tao_idl

          Updated because of rename above

        * DAnCE/TargetManager/TargetManager.idl:
          Renamed to TargetManagerImpl.idl, this is the interface
          it contains.

        * DAnCE/NodeApplication/Container_Impl.cpp
        * DAnCE/NodeApplication/Container_Impl.h
          Removed get_homes(), it is not in the base idl

          Simplified these mpc files, the -GT option is not added by
          orbsvcslib anymore and -Sc is deprecated

          Updated this test to reproduce a problem with valuetype
          insertion into an any. This test will now fail until
          Jeff Parsons commits some idl compiler changes
