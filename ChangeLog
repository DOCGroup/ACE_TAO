        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Name_Space.h:
          Fixed fuzz errors

Thu Nov  5 07:46:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ARGV.h:
          Define a private copy constructor and assignment operator. The
          compiler generated versions will not work correctly so prevent
          copying of an instance.

        * config-win32.h:
          Moved the check for __BORLANDC__ above the check for _MSC_VER. The
          preview Borland compilers defines both, but we must include in that
          case the Borland config file.

        * Connector.{h,cpp}:
          Moved include of Handle_Set.h from cpp to h file. We really need
          it in the header file.

        * config-all.h:
          Because ACE_OS is now a namespace we encountered a problem with the
          Borland compilers. In ACE_OS::fclose() we did call ::fclose() but
          the Borland compiler now gives an ambiguity between ACE_OS::fclose()
          and std::fclose(). To fix this we added ACE_STD_NAMESPACE which
          is set to std when ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB is defined
          to 1. In other cases we let ACE_STD_NAMESPACE be nothing. In
          ACE_OS::fclose() we program now ACE_STD_NAMESPACE::fclose() so that
          when using Borland this expands to std::fclose(), in other cases to
          ::fclose().

        * OS_NS_stdio.inl:
        * OS_NS_time.cpp:
        * OS_NS_time.inl:
        * OS_NS_wchar.inl:
          Use ACE_STD_NAMESPACE for the method which appear in ACE_OS and std

Wed Nov  5 05:33:44 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ACEXML/common/FileCharStream.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_wchar.h when ACE_USES_WCHAR is defined.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Console_Input.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Directory_Changes.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Multithreading.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Registration.cpp:
          Added #included needed on Windows due to recent subsetting.

	* COPYING: Modified to include CIAO in the Copyright disclaimer.
	  Thanks to Roland Schimmack <SC@ProCom.de> for motivating the change.

        * ace/OS_String.h:
        * ace/OS_TLI.h:

          Moved the #defines of ACE_OS_String, ACE_OS_Memory,
          ACE_OS_Dirent, and ACE_OS_TLI to config-all.h.  This makes it
          easier for older code that may still use these old class names
          to continue to compile even though the header refactoring has
          eliminated the old empty headers.

Tue Nov  4 16:03:06 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/Makefile.am (HEADER_FILES):

          Removed #include of streams.h.

        * tests/CDR_File_Test.cpp:

	  in these files use the global errno variable.

	* ace/os_include/os_pthread.h:

	  Don't define ACE_HAS_MUTEX_TIMEOUTS if it has been previously
	  defined.  Fixes a warning for configurations that explicitly
	  define ACE_HAS_MUTEX_TIMEOUTS.

	  Do not directly check the GNU libc-specific "__USE_XOPEN2K"
	  XPG6 feature test macro.  The correct/portable way to check for
	  XPG6 features is to check if _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600.

	* ace/os_include/sys/os_time.h:

	  No need to include "ace/os_include/sys/os_select.h".

	* ace/os_include/sys/os_types.h:

Tue Nov  4 06:20:18 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6ProjectCreator.pm:

          Remove an unnecessary intermediate variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7dll.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7exe.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7lib.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7libexe.mpt:

          Split static projects from dynamic projects ala VC6.  When one VC7
          static library project depends on another, they are linked
          together as the second one is built.  This causes the contents of
          each library to grow tremendously.  Splitting the projects allows
          us to omit the project dependencies for static libraries.

Tue Nov  4 01:03:56 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (AC_PREREQ):

          Fixed typo in copyright statement.

          Bumped autoconf prerequisite to version 2.57g.  Function tests
          in versions prior to that did not function properly on HP-UX.

          (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR):

          Call this Autoconf macro with an "aux" argument.  This causes
          all autotool related scripts to be placed in to the `aux'
          directory.  Addresses a problem with some versions of libtoolize
          where an empty auxiliary directory name is assumed instead of
          the well defined defaults.  This change also happens to remove
          some of the clutter in the top-level directory.

          (AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR):

          Call this Autoconf macro with a "m4" argument to inform
          autotools that recognize this macro where the ACE Autconf/M4
          macros are located.

        * bin/bootstrap:

          Replaced manual calls to aclocal, autoheader, autoconf, automake
          and libtoolize with a single call to `autoreconf'.  The latter
          is a bit smarter about bootstrapping autoconfiscated
          workspaces, and also allows us to simplify this bootstrap
          script.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Started converting all Bourne shell "if" blocks to Autoconf
          "AS_IF" blocks.  The latter provides improved portability.

        * m4/acinclude.m4:
        * m4/compiler.m4:
        * m4/features.m4:
        * m4/subsets.m4:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

        * m4/config_h.m4 (AH_TOP):

          Removed "-*- C++ -*-" Emacs mode comment.  It had no effect
          since it wasn't in the first few lines of the generated
          `config.h' file.

          (AH_BOTTOM):

          Define Emacs mode at the bottom of the generated `config.h' file
          using the canonical Emacs "Local Variables" block.  The
          generated `config.h' file is now correctly interpreted as a C++
          header when opened in Emacs.


        * m4/threads.m4:

          Started converting all Bourne shell "if" blocks to Autoconf
          "AS_IF" blocks.  The latter provides improved portability.

          Refactored common POSIX threads detection code to an autoconf
          macro.

          Replaced brittle POSIX thread code that checked for backward
          compatibility macros.  Use a run/link-time test instead.  This
          allows us to avoid determining what the real pthread_create()
          function is called.  This should fix a Pthread detection problem
          that occurred on HP-UX.

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Updated source lists with latest set of source filenames.

        * apps/gperf/mdate-sh:
        * apps/gperf/texinfo.tex:

          Removed these files.  They are automatically added when
          bootstrapping an "autoconfiscated" workspace.

Wed Nov  4 08:34:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp: (getmacaddress)
          Always do an reinterpret_cast because the static_cast also doesn't
          work when ansi casts is enabled. Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edanayal@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Wed Nov  4 08:18:37 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_signal.h:
          Removed include of OS_export and changed ACE_OS_Export to
          ACE_Export to fix compile errors.

Wed Nov  4 06:15:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Nov  3 20:35:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION, since
          CC 5.3 seems to be doing the right thing for class member
          specializations. We will soon check things out on other
          compilers.

Mon Nov  3 19:38:45 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-all.h:

          Added a new #define, ACE_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION
          which defines template <>  for definitions of member functions
          of a class that is specialized.

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION, since
          g++ is doing the right thing for class member specializations.

Mon Nov  3 17:02:42 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
        * ace/config-macosx.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_WCHAR_H.

          defined.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_msg.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_shm.inl:
          Added #include of OS_NS_errno.h:

Mon Nov  3 16:43:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl:
          Added missing #includes needed on HPUX due to recent
          subsetting.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
          Changed #ifdef around ACE_OS::timezone implementation to be just
          __GNUG__ since it seems to be needed on all OS's that use g++.

        * ace/OS_NS_string.h:
          Changed ACE_OS_Export to ACE_Export.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Added #include of sys/pstat.h needed on HPUX.

        * ace/os_include/os_termios.h:
          Added #include of sys/modem.h on HPUX to pickup the MDTR
          definition.

Mon Nov  3 10:19:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
          Updated this file with all recent changes

Mon Nov  3 08:24:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_TERMIOS_H

Mon Nov  3 06:41:16 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.h:
          Added missing ACE_Export to printf() declaration.

Mon Nov  3 06:09:08 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/MM_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp:
        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Scatter_Gather_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SPIPE_Test.cpp:
          Added #includes needed on Windows due to recent
          subsetting.

Mon Nov  3 05:02:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp:
          Added missing #ifdef ACE_MT_SAFE around
          ACE_OS::netdb_{acquire|release} method implementations.  This
          fixes single threaded build errors on platforms that define
          ACE_LACKS_NETDB_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS.

Mon Nov  3 04:43:43 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Makefile:
        * bin/reverseclean:
          Pass the $(MAKE) variable to the reverseclean script and use it
          instead of "make".  This fixes problems in autobuilds that
          assign something other than "make" to the make_program
          variable.

Mon Nov  3 04:12:12 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_freebsd.GNU:
          Overhaul the OS version tests so that they actually work.
          The "-pthread" gcc flag was recently deprecated in FreeBSD's gcc, so
          use the correct pthread flags for gcc, based on the OS version.
          Inspired by similar tests in /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk

Mon Nov  3 03:04:48 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Barrier.h:
        * ace/Managed_Object.h:
        * ace/Object_Manager.h:

          Added #include needed when not inlining due to recent
          subsetting.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Added #ifdef ACE_MT_SAFE around ACE_OS_Thread_Mutex_Guard
          implementation.

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.h:
          Removed ACE_OS friend statements and redundant method
          declarations (which were problematic on Windows).

        * ace/Token.cpp:
          Moved #include of Token.i outside of ACE_HAS_THREADS #ifdef
          since ACE_Noop_Token is there and required in single threaded
          builds.

Sun Nov  2 15:58:23 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Added a comment about footprint and compile times, and moved the
          commented out files up--MPC doesn't like comments in file
          lists.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.inl:
          Fixed a couple of instances of ::memcpy that didn't include
          ACE_OS.

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp:
          Added #include Object_Manager_Base.h.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Added #include Object_Manager_Base.h and OS_NS_Thread.h.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
          Added #include OS_NS_sys_time.h.

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp:
          Added #include of OS_NS_Thread.h needed when

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp:
          Fixed typo.

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h:
          Fixed typo.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
          for reporting this.

Sat Nov  1 23:45:49 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/ACE_export.h:
          Added ACE_NAMESPACE_INLINE_FUNCTION and ACE_NAMESPACE_STORAGE_CLASS
          macros to help control exporting of symbols from namespaces on
          Windows.

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Added defines to specify that MinGW lacks certain header files.
          Because of the rework this was now found.

          ACE_OS; changes u_long, etc., to unsigned long to reduce
          dependencies; reordered includes in *.cpp's to come after the
          inline file include, reducing the difference between inlined and
          non-inlined builds.

        * ace/CLASSIX/CLASSIX_Port_Core.h:
          Removed #include OS.h from these files, but didn't add new

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserContext.cpp:
          Added template instantiation for ACE_Swap.

          ACE_Multihomed_INET_Addr.  The "broken templates" section of
          OS.h has been changed accordingly.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.cpp:

          Hostname restrictions are now preserved during wildcard bind
          operations.

          The dependencies were not right. For long the weak links between
          libraries allowed us to get away without proper
          dependencies. With the refactoring the dependencies got explicit
          and we need the dependencies set right.

          Allow a user to set the sharedname to empty to force only static

          implementation of the vc7 type would involve splitting the static
          build targets from the dynamic into separate projects.

Thu Oct 30 16:14:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (spawn_i):

          Fixed ACE_Thread_Manager problem on VxWorks where thread id
          could be corrupted by taking address of a temporary
          variable. Thank to Dennis Noll, and Brian Mendel for tracking
          this down.

Thu Oct 30 11:57:36 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added a couple of Portable_Interceptor
          tests to the daily builds.

Thu Oct 30 09:33:15 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Allow the GENFLAGS value to be overriden by MPC when the makefiles
          are being generated.

Thu Oct 30 14:24:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.mpc:
          Corrected dynamicflags

Thu Oct 30 07:48:29 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:

          Removed the double quotes around E.idl, since this caused problems
          with the VC71 projects and wasn't necessary anyway.

Thu Oct 30 06:35:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Fixed a reference of libflag that should have been staticflag.

Wed Oct 29 14:06:45 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.{h,i}: Added default constructor for
          ConfigInfo, which puts in default values.

Wed Oct 29 12:02:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/automake.mpd: Change the
          minimum required automake version to 1.7 and added some
          further header comments.

Wed Oct 29 07:03:12 2003  UTC Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added a rule so that files with extension .rc are compiled with
          COMPILE.rc which is then the RC. By setting then RC to the
          resource compiler in the specific GNU file resource files are
          compiled.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added COMPILE.rc rule that uses the new RC to make it easy to set the
          resource compiler needed.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Set RC to windres. Cygwin and MinGW have a resource compiler and then
          put version info into the DLL.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Generate the resource files into the makefile and when RC is set add
          those files to FILES so that the resource files are compiled.

          Thanks to Andrew L. Shwaika <als@solvo.ru> for pointing us at the
          possibility to use a resource compiler with MinGW.

Tue Oct 28 17:07:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Makefile.am: Added definition of ACLOCAL so autoconf stuff gets
          rebuilt correctly when needed.

Tue Oct 28 16:33:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/ace.m4: Added new option, --enable-stdcpplib, defaults to yes.
          This enables (disables) use of the standard C++ library on platforms
          where it makes a difference, like HP-UX aC++.

        * m4/compiler.m4: For HP aC++, add -Ae (c89 mode) to CFLAGS.
          When using --enable-stdcpplib=yes with aC++, add -AA to CXXFLAGS.

Tue Oct 28 07:52:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Added GNU variable pipes. When this is not set, it defaults to 0.
          When it is 1, it results in adding -pipe to the CFLAGS.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Only set pipes to 1, the new code in wrapper_macros.GNU will add
          the needed compiler flag

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          When running the Tornado compiler on Win32 we can use pipes, so
          when pipes is not set, set it to 1. Also don't add the compiler
          flag anymore, this is done in wrapper_macros.GNU

Mon Oct 27 16:00:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACEXML/common/ZipCharStream.cpp: Silence HP aC++ warnings about
          an empty translation unit.

Mon Oct 27 15:51:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/acinclude.m4: Remove \ from \-quoted double- and back-quote
          characters to obey warnings from autoheader 2.57g. autoheader's
          processing of these warnings was erroneous, causing it to fail.

Mon Oct 27 19:48:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
          For reverseclean don't use the reverse_clean perl script but do
          a realclean in reverse order. This fixes the problem we have in the
          Sun Forte build where the list of arguments to the perl script is
          to long.

Mon Oct 27 11:17:03 2003  Gautam Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * SOCK_SEQPACK_clt.cpp:
          Fixed a previously made change that was using sizes for tests as
          n**2 rather than 2**n!
          SOCK_STREAM_clt.cpp:
          Fixed a previously made change that was using sizes for tests as
          n**2 rather than 2**n!

Fat Oct 25 10:51:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Fixed compile problem in this file

Fri Oct 17 18:40:55 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Modify the ACE_Log_Msg::dec() method to avoid
          "going negative."  Thanks to Matthieu Vansteene
          <matthieu.vansteene@regis-dgac.net> for reporting this.

Thu Oct 23 17:14:47 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Fixed a problem whereby ACE_IOV_MAX
          should have been 16 for Win 95/98/me.  Thanks to Enrico Detoma
          <enrico.detoma@email.it> for reporting this.

Fri Oct 24 11:27:52 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.3.5 released.

Fri Oct 24 10:48:41 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Changed documentation to reflect the fact that
          $ACE_ROOT/lib also has to added LD_LIBRARY_PATH since some of
          the libraries are generated in this directory.

Fri Oct 24 10:46:56 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile: Added lib to the release files.

Wed Oct 22 11:14:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/tests/Counter64_Test.cpp:
          Added define ULLONG on Win32 to fix compile error with MinGW.

Tue Oct 21 11:00:51 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp (notify): Release memory from the
          Event_Handler_var after adding messages to the notify queue
          without adding any messages to the pipe. Thanks to the daily
          builds for catching this.

Mon Oct 20 13:31:36 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Remove the dependency on the pch generated file from the object
          target.  It is unnecessary and causes problems with the /YX
          option.

Mon Oct 20 16:38:12 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:
          Don't exclude *.exp when linking since these are the expected
          result files for apps/gperf/tests.

        * tests/New_Fail_Test:
          Added #ifdef around unused code to remove warnings>

        * ace/Auto_Event.cpp:
        * ace/Event.cpp:
        * ace/Lock.cpp:
        * ace/Manual_Event.cpp:
        * ace/Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/RW_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/RW_Thread_Mutex.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.cpp:
          Added #include of the associated headers that were missing.
          This will be needed once these files are compiled seperately via
          MPC.  Thanks to Barry Benowitz <b.benowitz@telesciences.com> for
          motivating this.

Sun Oct 19 21:25:59 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/hist.cpp: Fixed fuzz errors. Include
          "ace/os_include/os_math.h" instead of math.h.

Sun Oct 19 21:16:44 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/JAWS3/small/SS_Service_Handler.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS3/small/SS_Service_Handler.h: Fixed Fuzz errors.

Sun Oct 19 20:36:50 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/docs/Kokyu.html:

        * Kokyu/KokyuEC.jpg: Moved these files to Kokyu/docs. Thanks to
          Bala for pointing this out.

Fri Oct 17 16:21:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Only set SONAME if
          platform_macros.GNU didn't.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU: Conditionalize
          addition of SONAME to SOFLAGS based on versioned_so, not on
          SONAME's content. However, even with versioned_so, don't try to
          add SOFLAGS stuff if with_ld is openbsd - it doesn't support it.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU: Set versioned_so
          to 0 by default to avoid shared lib version tagging rather
          than set SONAME to blank.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openbsd.GNU: Set with_ld to openbsd
          to tell platform_g++_common.GNU not to add the ldname options
          even if versioned_so is enabled.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Add shared lib
          option to SOFLAGS if versioned_so is 1. Set versioned_so to 1
          by default.

Fri Oct 17 06:48:15 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.h:
          When using the new CBX preview compiler define ACE_NSIG as _NSIG

Thu Oct 16 21:18:06 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/kokyu_dsrt_schedulers.mpb:
          Added rtscheduling as a base project. This should take care of
          link problems in cygwin build.

Thu Oct 16 18:08:01 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          Reverted my change below, when I committed it, I realized it
          is not the correct place

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_PTRDIFF_T and ACE_PTRDIFF_T_TYPE to get the
          ptrdiff_t out of the std namespace.

Thu Oct 16 17:56:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          When using the new Borland compiler from CBuilderX get
          ptrdiff_t out of the std namespace. This fixes hundreds
          of compile errors in our CBX Preview build.

Thu Oct 16 09:03:11 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed another problem with * in the after keyword.  Multiple
          listings with * would only pick up the first one.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          If install is set to . for exe's then don't do anything.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support for setting ar flags and setting cpp flags on the
          make command line.

Thu Oct 16 09:02:24 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:

          Escape regular expression special characters from strings
          before they are used as regular expressions.

Thu Oct 16 08:37:54 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * apps/gperf/tests/tests.mpc:

          Fixed a bug with dependencies and parallelism between building the
          test and running the test.

Wed Oct 15 13:40:02 2003  Huang-Ming Huang <hh1@cse.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrtevent.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrteventclient.mpb
          Added for fault tolerant event service.

Wed Oct 15 18:28:02 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/net/os_if.h:
          Added #undef of IOR on HP-UX.  IOR is used in TAO.  Thanks to
          Torsten Kopper <tkue_0931@fastmail.fm> for this patch.

Wed Oct 15 12:10:39 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Updated the documentation to make it
          clear that setenv is a TCSH/CSHism.  Thanks to David McKen
          <cic_3_b@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Wed Oct 15 13:22:32 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU:
          Also set versioned_so to 0 in this file.

Wed Oct 15 13:16:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:
          Instead of setting SONAME and SOVERSION to empty, set
          versioned_so to 0 to indicate that versioned dll's should
          be used because cygwin and mingw have problem with this.
          This makes Cygwin/MinGW working again.

Wed Oct 15 08:45:20 EDT 2003  Kevin Bryank <bryank@cs.uri.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcosscheduling.mpb:
          Adding base project for using the RTC 1.0 Scheduling Service

Wed Oct 15 10:40:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          Fixed unused argument warning when ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE
          is defined

Tue Oct 14 21:54:07 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CIAO_CORE_DIRS): Added Kokyu to the list of base
          library for CIAO.  Although CIAO doesn't depend on Kokyu, it is
          needed to allow the compilation in orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ to run to
          completion.

Tue Oct 14 23:21:00 UTC 2003  Don Hinton <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Removed following method declarations that were not implemented
          or used: times(), cond_timedwait_i(), alarm_i(), ualarm_i(),
          sleep_i(), nanosleep_i(), select_i(), poll_i(), sema_wait_i(),
          sigtimedwait_i(), gettimeofday_i().

        * ace/Process.h:
          Fixed typo and added #include of Global_Macros.h.

Tue Oct 14 17:13:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process.h: Put the ACE_Process copy constructor and
          assignment operator in the private part of the class to disallow
          copying.  Thanks to Adam Fanello <yahoo@fanello.net> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/OS.cpp: Added patches to support PHARLAP.  Thanks
          to Ira Burton <imburton@micron.com> for supplying these.

Tue Oct 14 13:54:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
        Picked up from ACE 5.3:
        Wed Jun 11 17:18:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Make SOVERSION
          user-settable if versioned_so is enabled. Thanks to Craig L.
          Ching <cching@mqsoftware.com> for this idea.
          Also moved the versioned_so and SOVERSION setup to after
          platform_macros.GNU is included so that users can set this stuff
          up in their platform_macros.GNU file. The ACE_MAJOR_VERSION,
          etc. variables are still set up before platform_macros.GNU, though,
          in case platform_macros.GNU wants to use them.

Tue Oct 14 10:45:32 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Added a new CIAO_Core target for building all CIAO
          core libraries and tools, including everything they need.
          Thanks to Gautam for suggesting this.

Tue Oct 14 03:43:47 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Direct_Dispatcher_Impl_T.cpp: Added this->
          qualification to instance variables in base class to fix
          compile warnings in HPUX build.

        * Kokyu/Default_Dispatcher_Impl.cpp:
        * Kokyu/DSRT_CV_Dispatcher_Impl_T.cpp:
        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.cpp:
        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.h:
        * Kokyu/Kokyu.h:
        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.i: Removed/added comments

          real.

Mon Oct 13 15:25:41 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/kokyu_dsrt_schedulers.mpb:
          Added include path to the Kokyu_dsrt_schedulers directory.

Mon Oct 13 08:51:29 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ace_wchar.inl: Reverted the change to BUG 1605 that was
          applied. The MSDN documentation doesn't suggest a 1 instead of a
          -1. Reopening BUG 1605.

Mon Oct 13 12:39:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
          Fixed typo in Reactor_Notification_Queue_Test

Mon Oct 13 08:36:43 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_dsrt.h:

          Added first version of cbx generator. This generated project files
          for the new C++BuilderX development environment. This just sets some
          of the options and adds all files to the project.

Sun Oct 12 17:34:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Removed mentioning of tests/run_tests.bat, it has been removed
          some time ago and the perl script run_tests.pl is the only one
          to use. Updated documentation for Borland support. CBuilderX is
          now supported, but not the new preview compiler that is shipped
          with CBuilderX.

        * Kokyu/Default_Dispatcher_Impl.cpp:

          Added allocator, sched scope, sched policy, reordering queue
          attributes to the Dispatcher_Attributes class. This will make
          the dispatcher more configurable.

        * Kokyu/tests/EDF/test.cpp:

          Added command line options to specify the sched policy.

Fri Oct 10 19:52:26 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.{h,i}:
          On some platforms clearerr is a macro. Because of this,
          the name ACE_OS::clearerr will cause errors. So in order
          to use the macro as it is defined but also keep the name
          ACE_OS::clearerr, clearerr macro is used in inline function,
          and then undefined.  This patch fixes the "fixes" committed by
          Wed Sep 24 08:57:36 2003  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> and Tue Apr 15 16:06:24 2003  Douglas
          C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>.  Thanks to Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for submitting the patch and Bala for motivation me
          to apply it...

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          Instead of obj use $(OBJEXT) and instead of lib use $(LIBEXT) to
          handle the new extensions for the CBX Preview compiler.

Fri Oct 10 08:14:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          Added some support for the new CBuilderX preview compiler. This has
          a different name and different options to be used. When defining CBX
          as environment variable this new compiler is used, else we just use
          the normal compiler.

Thu Oct 09 12:43:51 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtscheduling.mpb (after): The
          after directive should have the name of the project and not the
          name of the directory.  This should solve the problem of
          RTScheduling tests making before the RTScheduler library has
          been built.

Wed Oct  8 14:17:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          When using Kylix use a different $(BIN) rule. This will fix a lot
          of the errors we have in the Kylix build.

        * apps/soreduce/Obj_Module.cpp:
        * apps/soreduce/SO_Group.cpp:
          Fixed compile errors that appeared in the MinGW build. Used
          the ACE_OS version of methods instead of the native ones.

Wed Oct  8 07:12:33 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/address.cpp:

Tue Oct  7 14:54:47 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.h: Renamed a variable name, signals to sigset. The
          former was creating problems when Reactor is used with
          Qt. Thanks to Hans Utz <hans.utz@informatik.uni-ulm.de> for
          reporting the problem.

        * Makefile: Added Kokyu to the list of controlled files. Thanks to
          Don Hinton for the patch and Werner Buchert for reporting the
          problem.

Tue Oct 07 14:01:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          supports these.

Tue Oct 07 06:07:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Define ACE_HAS_SSIZE_T when building with MinGW version 3 or later

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp:
        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.h:
        * Connection/blocking/test_spipe_acceptor.cpp:
          This example uses AsynchIO, check for this when compiling and when
          this is not available then just build a main saying this isn't
          available. This fixes build problems in the Cygwin build.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Generate NAME, else nothing happens when building with Borland.

Thu Oct  2 13:49:22 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          Also remove underscores that are followed by spaces.  The value
          could be a space separated list and removing the trailing
          underscore isn't enough.

Thu Oct  2 13:02:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:

          When generating project names from '*' remove trailing

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7exe.mpt:

          When building release targets set optimize equal to 3 (full
          optimization).

Wed Oct  1 07:20:31 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Escape special characters of strings that are going to be used as
          regular expressions.

Wed Oct  1 06:55:03 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * apps/drwho/drwho.mpc:
        * apps/drwho/nobuild.mpb:

          Added verbatim (in nobuild.mpb) to stop the drwho application from
          building on VxWorks, Chorus, minbw32 and cygwin32.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added a new marker to support the above change.

Thu Sep 25 09:28:47 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Misc/childbirth_time.cpp (prof_ace_os_thread): Replaced

          Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for reporting this.

        * ace/Pipe.cpp (open): Swapped the order of the SO_RCVBUF and
          SO_SNDBUF socket option calls so that the reader sets the RCVBUF
          and the writer sets the SNDBUF.  Thanks to Tomer Amiaz

        * tests/Bug_1576_Regression_Test.dsp:
        * tests/tests.dsw:

          Added missing MSVC++ 6 project file for Bug_1576_Regression_Test
          test.  Fixes failures in Windows builds due to missing project
          file.

Mon Sep 22 11:36:26 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/SString.cpp:

          Added __Lynx__ to the special check for instantiating
          ACE_String_Base<char>::NULL_String_.

Mon Sep 22 11:04:03 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portablegroup.mpb:

          Use comps and tagchecks instead of requires for 'PortableGroup'.

Mon Sep 22 10:16:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:

          Only set optimize to 1 if it hasn't been set previously.

Fri Sep 19 07:01:48 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

Thu Sep 18 13:49:56 2003  Gautam H. Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README:

          Added a table providing additional clarifications about
          different implementations of SCTP under Linux and its
          implications with respect to ACE Wrapper facades supported.

Thu Sep 18 10:55:58 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Removed the S.cpp from the specialized idl file rules to avoid yet
          another parallel build problem.

Thu Sep 18 08:34:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-all.h:

          Corrected a misspelling of ace in a #include.

Tue Sep 16 13:19:42 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Set the TEMPINCDIR to a subdirectory under the original TEMPINCDIR
          value.  This will happen only if TEMPINCDIR is defined (for AIX).

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix4_cset++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:

          Set the template include directory via the -qtempinc=<directory>
          option instead of using the default (tempinc).

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Use $(TEMPINCDIR) instead of tempinc.

Tue Sep 16 10:28:02 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Escape the file name that's used as a regular expression.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Add implicit project dependencies when using the -hierarchy
          option.

Mon Sep 15 13:22:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added some optimizations to the circular dependency tree
          generation code.

Mon Sep 15 06:42:28 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a check in the dependency sorter for an undefined dependency
          value (this only happended with the vc7 and vc71 types).

Fri Sep 12 13:31:50 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Updated the code to detect and drop circular dependencies.  The
          original code was wrong and would drop dependencies that didn't
          need to be.

Fri Sep 12 11:51:17 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.dsp:

          Fixed setting for release configuration.

Fri Sep 12 11:36:17 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Modified the AIX compiler support to be a rule, instead of
          modifying $(COMPILE.cc), that will be run before building the all
          target.

Fri Sep 12 10:56:02 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * Second anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks on
          the USA.  Let us pray that clear heads will prevail in the
          prevention of future conflicts.

Thu Sep 11 06:39:23 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug with the automatic project dependencies that was
          related to directories and the location that mwc.pl was run.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added support for poor AIX compilers that don't deal with
          templates correctly.  This was basically a cut and paste into the
          template from the original ACE_wrappers/tests/Makefile.

Wed Sep 10 13:26:14 MST 2003 Trevor Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh:

          Changed the path to mogrify. It uses /usr/bin/X11/bin path if it is
          not present in the /usr/local/bin

Wed Sep 10 11:48:31 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Added support for files with spaces (vc7 already supported them).

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Fixed a warning about the /Ob option.

Wed Sep 10 10:21:16 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added automatic parallel dependencies.  If more than one project
          in the same directory contains shared source files, then the
          projects will become dependent upon each other.  This will help
          avoid files (both generated source and object) being overwritten
          by multiple instances of make.  This only has an effect on the
          GNUACE workspaces.

Tue Sep  9 15:04:51 MST 2003 Trevor Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com>

          I realized that many more mpc projects use client and server.
          They should be converted to use taoserver and taoclient, but until
          that happens I will put these back.

Thu Sep  4 16:00:18 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h: Updated the documentation for

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.LKSCTP:
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.OpenSS7:

        Slight update to README files. Made more clear how SCTP
        capable kernel and ACE/TAO are built. Due to recent
        changes in LKSCTP API additional changes will be committed
        in near future as new Linux kernel with the changes is released.

Thu Sep  4 09:56:28 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Modified the GNUACEWorkspaceCreator to generate a workspace that
          will work with the -j option of GNU Make.  Each project in the
          workspace has an individual target with dependencies on the
          necessary targets which allows GNU Make to determine which
          projects can be built in parallel.

Thu Sep  4 09:30:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h: Reverted this change "Wed Sep 3 17:42:00 2003
          Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>". This caused builds to
          break so easily.

Wed Sep 3 17:42:00 2003 Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:

          An empty ACE_ASSERT now uses ACE_UNUSED_ARG. This prevents
          warnings by compilers that aren't smart enough to recognize that
          the code *is* used, but only by the preprocessor.

Wed Sep  3 17:01:02 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          builds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Added a dependency to all source files upon any generated files
          (be it idl or custom build).

Wed Sep  3 09:44:01 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Move the location of the idl_stubs dependency above the include of
          rules.lib.GNU.

Tue Sep 2 18:00:00 2003 Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:
        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.i:

          Removed implementations of copy constructors and assignment
        operators, and made them private. These were not correct, and
        would cause an infinite loop if ever called. I also had to
        comment out several other broken operators that were using the
        copy constructors or assignment operators. In general, someone
        should take a close look at these classes, and either fix all the
        many problems, or remove apparently unnecessary features entirely.

        * test/tests.mpc:

          Added support for the UUID test. This test really doesn't test
        very much right now, as it still passed even though I had removed
        most of the functionality from the uuid classes.

Sat Aug 30 12:10:00 2003 Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Changed to continue linking even when some source files can't
        be found. It appears that the perl link() function doesn't work
        correctly on Windows Server 2003. A little investigating shows that
        several other file functions have problems with long path names on
        that os unless you use the Unicode versions. I verified this with a
        simple c++ program, that tried to use _fullpath() and CreateHardLink().
        Currently the only problems are in the Notify service performance tests,
        because these have extremely long path names.

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Blobby/blobby.mpc:
        * apps/soreduce/soreduce.mpc:
          Added exename to both of these to force an exe to be created
          instead of a library.

        * tests/RMCast/acetest.mpb
          Modified the path for Main.cpp so that it picks up the one in
          the current directory.  Some build were having problems with
          this and didn't create the .obj directory which cause
          compilation to fail.

Fri Aug 29 13:41:40 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Modified the template to avoid including wrapper_macros.GNU more
          than once.  Instead of setting SHLIB_UNCHECKED and then checking
          for the feature and setting SHLIB if it's enabled, I set SHLIB,
          check for the feature and then reset SHLIB if the feature isn't
          enabled.

Fri Aug 29 13:21:01 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Elaborated on a key point of custom definitions.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Empty the ACELIB variable after including wrapper_macros.GNU.
          This is a feature of wrapper_macros.GNU that MPC doesn't need.

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.cpp:

          instantiations to fix compile errors in
          Solaris_9_Forte7_ACE_(MPC) build. Thanks to Don Hinton for
          pointing this out.

        From Don Hinton <dhinton@dresystems.com>
        * tests/Bug_1576_Regression_Test.cpp:

          Updated to work in wchar builds.

Thu Aug 28 07:57:33 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Added ERROR: to the output when an unknown option is passed on the

          Removed these files since they should be generated dynamically
          by the new MPC Makefiles (that will also be generated
          dynamically).

Wed Aug 27 20:34:19 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h: Added export qualification to
          Dispatcher_Attributes class to fix link error in
          Win2K_VC71_NET_DLL build.

Wed Aug 27 17:52:44 2003  George Edwards <g.edwards@vanderbilt.edu>

Wed Aug 27 15:18:49 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU (CCFLAGS):

          Do not add "-Wno-uninitialized" to GNU C++ compiler flags.  It
          is no longer needed to avoid (apparently) bogus warnings.
          Keeping it around hides potentially real problems.

          Reverted the -recurse change from Mon Aug 18 12:28:09 2003.  Added
          a -exclude option that allows users to exclude directories
          independently from the -recurse option.

Wed Aug 27 13:25:20 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h: Added inline qualification to operator != to
          fix warnings in SunOS_SunCC53 build.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_udp_proactor.cpp:
          Added a main that is used when these examples are build on a
          platform on which these examples don't work. This fixes the link
          errors in the Cygwin build.

Wed Aug 27 10:32:03 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Added a -hierarchy option which forces MPC to generate a workspace
          at each directory level between the current directory and the
          directory in which the mpc file is located.

          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing this out.

        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.h:

Tue Aug 26 11:22:41 UTC 2003  Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Projects should default to optimization=0. This prevented the
          tao_idl project from compiling.

Tue Aug 26 11:10:45 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:

          Changed the logic of the checks for return value in
          insertion and extraction of bounded (w)strings. If the
          bound_ member value of the helper construct was 0, the
          operator could incorrectly return 0 after a successfull
          read or write. Thanks to Tufan Oruk <toruk@usa.net> and
          Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for independently
          reporting problems that are consequences of this bug.

Tue Aug 26 09:21:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When checking for the -k option, remove --unix from the MAKEFLAGS
          value.  This helps things work with Cygwin.  Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen for reporting this.

Tue Aug 26 08:37:21 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Sched_Queue_T.h: Changed the prototype of
          Guid_Hash::operator method with full qualification for the
          Guid_t type. This is to fix compile errors in
          SunOS_8_Forte8_Debug build.

        SSL now works in a more normal MPC feature fashion similar to all
        the other feature-based libraries. I removed the hard-coded ssl
        logic from some of the mpd files that still had it. A side-effect
        of the new way, is that you must now define an SSL_ROOT
        environment variable that the openssl.mpb feature will now use to
        locate the openssl libraries.

        There were some problems with the existing vc7.mpd template.  I've
        improved the template, and also added support for lots of new
        settings in the corresponding .mpt files. (Although I haven't used
        them yet.)  I'll probably use this to enable some of the new
        features in vc71 that help track down problems that typically only
        show up in release mode.

        The creation of workspaces for vc71 did not correctly set
        dependencies between projects.

        I added an allow_duplicates() method to the WorkspaceCreator.  A
        warning will always be generated if a workspace contains duplicate
        project names, and now the vc6/7/71 creators will abort creation
        of these invalid workspaces. I suggest that any future
        WorkspaceCreator subclasses that generate IDE projects, override
        allow_duplicates() to return 0.

        Renamed the gperf_exe to gperf. This was named as a special hack
        for vc6 that is now unnecessary. We had already renamed other
        similar projects, but missed this one.

          Added missing mwc and mpc files.  Most of the mwc files were
          needed so that running mwc.pl -recurse would create Makefiles in
          directories that contained only subdirectories and no mpc files.

Mon Aug 18 12:28:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Options.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to exclude directories when using the -recurse
          option.  See USAGE or mwc.pl -h for details.

Mon Aug 18 15:22:02 2003  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Changed the TAO/orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo test from SANDBOX to
          !MINIMUM to broaden platform coverage of the IMR testing.

Sun Aug 17 16:35:01 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.i (dump_i):
        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp (dump_i):

          Uninlined this method to avoid adding an inter-header dependency
          on "ace/Log_Msg.h".  Also fixes some explicit template
          instantiation builds.

        * tests/Collection_Test.cpp:

          Removed duplicate template instantiation.

Sun Aug 17 16:06:20 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Shared_Object.h:

          Include "ace/os_includes/sys/os_types.h" to pull in size_t
          typedef instead of "ace/OS.h".  The latter is overkill.

        * ace/Shared_Object.cpp:

          Include "ace/Global_Macros.h" to pull in ACE_TRACE macro
          definition.

Sun Aug 17 15:31:29 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_CLEANUP_FUNC):
        * ace/config-all.h

          Moved this typedef to config-all.h.  Allows sources to use this
          typedef without including the compile-time expensive OS.h.

Fri Aug 15 14:02:22 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support to the 'make' type for AIX and IRIX.

Fri Aug 15 10:38:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a missing check for naming the foreach variable when dealing
          with grouped files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Moved the setting of LDLIBS or ACE_SHLIBS before including
          wrapper_macros.GNU.  This should allow for the kylix kludge to
          work.

Fri Aug 15 15:29:16 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Parse_Headers.cpp:
          Modified the ACCESSOR macro to only concatenate the x, or member
          variable, token.  This resolves a problem with the gcc 3.3
          proprocessor.  Thanks to Tim Hawes <thawes@althusius.net> for
          reporting the problem and Carlos O'Ryan for supplying the fix.

        * THANKS:
          Added Tim Hawes <thawes@althusius.net> to the hall of fame.

Fri Aug 15 09:07:09 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.{h,i}: Changed "advice" to "map_advice" to avoid a
          keyword naming conflict with AspectC++.  Thanks to Gary Duzan
          <gduzan@bbn.com> for reporting this.

Fri Aug 15 01:49:00 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Kokyu/Makefile.Kokyu:
          Moved the assigment to ACE_SHLIBS to a point prior to including
          wrapper_macros.GNU, because the code the modifies the link
          library names to work with Kylix is located in
          wrapper_macros.GNU, and must come after the assignment.

Fri Aug 15 00:37:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Added missing Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test and
          Unbounded_Set_Test_Ex projects.

Thu Aug 14 18:31:14 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Message_Queue.h:
          Added #include Null_Mutex.h and Null_Condition.h to the VxWorks
          specific branch needed due to recent subsetting.

        * ace/config-irix5.3-sgic++.h:
          Added #define ACE_LACKS_STDINT_H.  Thanks to Bruce Jones
          <BRUCE.JONES@cubic.com> for reporting the problem.

        * THANKS:
          Added Bruce Jones <BRUCE.JONES@cubic.com> to hall of fame.

Thu Aug 14 10:56:57 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.h:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):

          Fixed bug where the "counted down" timeout value was not used in
          the ACE::select() call.  This fixes a problem where connection
          timeouts lasted longer than they should have.  The corrected
          behavior now matches the documented behavior.

Thu Aug 14 04:02:41 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Kokyu/Makefile.Kokyu:
          Added ACELIB to ACE_SHLIBS to resolve link problems on MacOSX.
          Thanks to John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for reporting
          this.

        * Kokyu/Default_Dispatcher_Impl.cpp:

          Separated activation of the dispatcher and setting up of
          dispatching lanes. Added an activate () method to the dispatcher
          and associated classes.

Wed Aug 13 23:43:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Bound_Ptr.i:
          Added #include Log_Msg.h when ACE_NEW_THROWS_EXCEPTIONS is
          defined to pickup ACE_ASSERT.

        * apps/JAWS/server/HTTP_Server.cpp:
          Added a JAWS_ prefix the enums to get around conflict on Windows
          where ASYNCH is defined as a macro.

        * apps/soreduce/Obj_Module.cpp:
          Added #include Log_Msg.h to pickup ACE_ASSERT.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/Performance_Test_Options.cpp:
          Added #ifdef around ACE_Trace::start/stop_tracing() based on
          ACE_HAS_TRACE.

Wed Aug 13 20:27:46 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Added Multihomed_INET_Addr_Test.

Wed Aug 13 18:35:08 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp:
          Changed ACE_Thread_Mutex to ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX to quash an error on
          single threaded builds.

          Added missing MPC project files.

Wed Aug 13 15:47:13 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * apps/drwho/File_Manager.h:
          Added #include Null_Mutex.h needed when
          ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION is defined due to recent
          subsetting.

Mon Aug 11 19:19:24 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h: Updated the documentation to point to
          the C++NPv2 and POSA2 books.  Thansk to Valery Salamakha
          <ccapstan@bigpond.net.au> for motivating this change!

Mon Aug 11 08:39:06 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Koyu_dsrt.h: Removed Kokyu_Export qualification for
          template class MUF_Comparator. This was giving compile errors in
          Win2K_VC71_NET_DLL build.

Mon Aug 11 06:35:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Kokyu/Makefile:
          Removed windows specific part in this makefile. This gave
          problems with MinGW and the MSys shell and isn't needed.

Mon Aug 11 01:46:23 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified the test for "GNU ld" to grep for the count instead of
          relying on the return value which doesn't appear to work
          correctly on all versions, specifically MacOSX and older
          versions of OpenBSD (two platforms to which I lack access).
          Thanks to John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for help
          debugging this.

Sun Aug 10 14:04:17 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

Sun Aug 10 13:32:42 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Direct_Dispatcher_Impl_T.{h,cpp}: Moved the method
          definition of MoreEligible::operator() to the header file to get
          rid of MSV compiler errors. I suspect that the nested class
          MoreEligible could be causing the problem.

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Sched_Queue_T.{h,cpp}: Moved the method
          definition of Guid_Hash::operator() to the header file to get
          rid of MSV compiler errors. I suspect that the nested class
          could be causing the problem.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_dsrt.{h,cpp}: Corrected a typo and included
          Kokyu_dsrt.i instead of Kokyu.i. Removed Kokyu_Export
          qualification for template classes.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h: Added export qualification for noncopyable
          class.

Sun Aug 10 09:52:17 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.dsp:
        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.dsw:
        * Kokyu/tests/EDF/Makefile:
        * Kokyu/tests/FIFO/Makefile:
          Added the above files which were missing.

Sun Aug 10 08:58:18 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp: Included Synch.h to get rid of
          compile errors.

Sun Aug 10 08:16:36 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DEV.h: Fixed a typo in the definition of
          ACE_DEV_STREAM. Thanks to Edan Ayal <edanayal@yahoo.com> for
          pointing this out.

Sun Aug 10 06:17:43 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/Export/dll.cpp:
          Fixed a typo in last checkin, i.e., added a space.

Sat Aug  9 20:55:47 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp:
        * examples/Export/dll.cpp:
          Added missing explicit template instantiations.

        * examples/examples/OS/Process/imore.cpp:
        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-connector.cpp:
        * examples/OS/Process/process.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp:
          Added const to char* declarations to quash warnings.

        * examples/Timer_Queue/Thread_Timer_Queue_Test.cpp:
          Added #include Condition_T.h and Thread_Mutex.h needed for
          explicit template instantiation.

        * examples/Timer_Queue/Timer_Queue.mpc:
          Added "after" directive so library gets compiled first.

        * tests/Collection_Test.cpp:
          Fixed a typo in an explicit template instantiation directive.

Sat Aug  9 13:56:37 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.h: Deleted extra qualification for method
          prototype declarations to get rid of compiler warnings in
          Debian_Full_Reactors build.

        * Kokyu/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

Sat Aug  9 18:23:32 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Added Container_Instantiations.cpp to resolve problems on
          Solaris when templates=explicit.

Sat Aug  9 12:49:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * etc/tao_rtevent.doxygen:
          Added TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Service_Constants.h to the list
          of files that must be parsed for the RTEvent doxygen documentation

Sat Aug  9 06:17:49 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp:
          Readded explicit template instantiation of
          ACE_GUARD<ACE_PROCESS_MUTEX> and #includes needed to compile it.

Sat Aug  9 05:16:32 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified the ld version test so that it wouldn't printout error
          information to the build log on failure.

Sat Aug  9 04:21:24 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Add ACE_MT_SAFE=0 to CPPFLAG in wrapper_macros.GNU instead of
          each individual platform_*.GNU file.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          Set SONAME equal to nothing in the individual platform_*.GNU
          files to turn off library naming instead of using with_ld.
          with_ld, however it is still used with hpux to modify the
          options.

          Move the inclusion of platform_g++_common.GNU in the
          platform_*.GNU files to after DLD (and SONAME) have been set so
          that platform_g++_common.GNU can use the value to to help
          determine whether or not to add -Wl,-E to LDFLAGS.  Also added
          additional checking to make sure that we only test GNU ld.

Fri Aug  8 23:23:30 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.{h,cpp,i}:
          Renamed init() method so that it does not hide the base class
          init method.

        * Kokyu/Default_Dispatcher_Impl.cpp:
          Commented out some debug statements.

Sat Aug  9 01:03:52 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Based_Pointer_Repository.cpp:

Fri Aug  8 13:26:25 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.{h,cpp}: Changed typo TAO_SYNCH_MUTEX to
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX to get rid of compile errors in explicit
          template instantiation builds.

Fri Aug  8 11:03:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Remove the 'perl' call before depgen.pl.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/nmake.mpd:

          Put back ACE_ROOT reference in the templates for the depgen.pl
          script.  It is necessary since nmake doesn't support the windows
          associates like the command prompt does.

        * Makefile: Added Kokyu to CORE_DIRS list since
          TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs is in core build and
          TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/*Kokyu* depends on Kokyu framework.

Fri Aug  8 13:22:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/client/local_dgram_client_test.cpp:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/client/local_pipe_client_test.cpp:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/client/local_stream_client_test.cpp:
          Added include of OS.h to get ACE_TMAIN. This fixes the link errors we see
          with these examples.

Fri Aug  8 07:10:06 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Moved the shflags out of the configurations and into the
          platforms.  The link flag is particular to the linker of the
          platform.

Fri Aug  8 06:56:52 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a problem with my change from Thu Aug  7 12:43:05 2003.  The
          INSTARGET needed to be set before it was used in the all:
          dependencies.

Thu Aug  7 21:47:25 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.h: Included Dispatcher_Impl.h header file instead of
          forward declaring Dispatcher_Impl. This was causing compile
          errors/warnings in some builds.

        * Kokyu/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

Thu Aug 07 16:36:29 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt-min.mpb: Added a minimal Qt
          base project for those projects which require to use Qt library
          but not ACE_QtReactor.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt-min_moc.mpb: Same twist for
          qt_moc.mpb.  Things can probably be condensed more, later.

Thu Aug  7 13:29:22 2003  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile: Added Kokyu directory to DIRS and CLONE variables, so
          that it is included as part of the autobuilds and release tar
          ball. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com> for pointing
          this out.

Thu Aug  7 12:43:05 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a problem with the generic make template where a static
          library wouldn't get installed.

Thu Aug  7 13:08:28 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Unbounded_Set_Ex.cpp:
          Added #include of os_errno.h to pick up ENOMEM on older versions
          of gcc and needed due to recent subsetting.

Thu Aug  7 07:35:56 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Corrected a bug in the dependency sorting logic by removing the
          use of splice and manually moving the array entries.

Thu Aug  7 06:18:57 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Added a dash in front of the include for the dependency file to
          suppress warnings about missing files.

Thu Aug  7 00:12:50 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Handle_Set.i:
          Added several #includes required by the FD_ZERO macro on various
          platforms, including os_string.h, os_strings.h, and bstring.h,
          required by recent subsetting.

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp:
          Removed explicite template instantiation of
          ACE_GUARD<ACE_Process_Mutex> that doesn't appear to be needed
          within ACE and highlighted by recent subsetting.

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Added conditional #include TSS_Adapter.h when ACE_HAS_THR_C_DEST is
          defined and required by recent subsetting.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp:
          Added #include Null_Mutex.h required by recent subsetting.

        Please send all comments/questions about this commit to
        Jason Cohen, jcohen@atl.lmco.com

        LKSCTP Support added for Linux 2.5/2.6 kernels with LKSCTP patch.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.h:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.h:
          Changed default protocol from 0 to 132 (IPPROTO_SCTP).
          This forces all current usage of SOCK_SEQPACK_* to use
          SCTP.  This was done because LKSCTP support was added to
          the SOCK_SEQPACK code, but overrides with SOCK_STREAM.
          Currently, OpenSS7 and LKSCTP have different views on this.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.cpp:
          Added #ifdef ACE_HAS_LKSCTP sections to SOCK_SEQPACK_* files
          to support socket interface differences between LKSCTP and OpenSS7.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          To enable LKSCTP support on a patched Linux 2.5/2.6 kernel,
          you must supply 'sctp=lksctp' to your make command line.

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp
          Now allows automatic server selection of port.

        * performance-tests/SCTP/README
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.LKSCTP:
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.SCTP:
        * performance-tests/SCTP/README.SCTP_in_ACE:
          Made additions for LKSCTP to the documentation.

Wed Aug  6 14:13:25 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Null_Condition.h (vait):
          Removed unused variable in method declaration to quash a warning.

Wed Aug  6 03:29:03 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        Additional includes required by recent subsetting.

        * Kokyu/Dispatcher_Task.h: Lock_Adapter_T.h.
        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/http_headers.h: Null_Mutex.h.
        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/http_status.h: Synch_Traits.h.
        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Cache_Manager_T.cpp: streams.h.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Parse_Headers.h: Synch_Traits.h.
        * apps/soreduce/Library.h: streams.h.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Server.cpp:
          Added #ifdef around ACE_Trace calls to turn on/off tracing.

Wed Aug  6 02:27:32 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified the test for whether or not GNU ld supports the -E
          option needed to enable dynamic_casting of objects passed to
          shared libraries.  Thanks to Chris Cleeland
          <cleeland@ociweb.com> for suggesting we dynamically obtain which
          ld to use by passing the -print-prog-name to gcc, and
          Krishnakumar B <kitty@cse.wustl.edu> for the patch.

        * ace/Null_Mutex.h:
        * ace/Null_Semaphore.h:
          Removed unused variable name to silence warnings.

Tue Aug  5 17:25:35 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{cpp,h}:
          Added #includes of Reverse_Lock_T.h, Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h,
          NUll_Mutex.h, and Lock_Adapter_T.h needed due to recent subsetting.

        * ace/Dump_T.cpp:
          Added #include of Global_Macros.h.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
          Added #include of the appropriate new header to get the
          definition of placement new().  Thanks to Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for this suggestion.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Removed the explicite template instantiation of ACE_Reverse_Lock
          that wasn't used and appeared to be dead code.  Thanks to Olli
          Savia <ops@iki.fi> for pointing out the problem.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.{h,cpp}:
          Moved #include of Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h from the
          cpp to the header since it's used as a member variable.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/APC.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Abandoned.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Registration.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Registry_Changes.cpp:
          Added #include of Auto_Event.h needed due to recent subsetting
          changes.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
          Added #include of Thread_Semaphore needed due to recent
          subsetting changes.

Tue Aug  5 15:16:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_limit.h:
          Moved define for PIPE_BUF from os_errno.h, where it have been
          moved by mistake (see Mon Aug  4 13:08:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com>) to os_limit.h.

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_wait.h:
          Moved define for WNOHANG from os_errno.h, where it have been
          moved by mistake (see Mon Aug  4 13:08:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com>) to sys/os_wait.h.

Tue Aug  5 01:17:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Rolled back part of the fix from Mon Aug  4 21:02:12 UTC 2003
          Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>.  Some of the cpp still
          needs to be ifdef'd out for single threaded builds.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp:
          Added #include Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h needed on some
          Windows builds.

Mon Aug  4 21:02:12 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/TSS_T.{h,cpp}:
          Removed ACE_HAS_THREADS #ifdef around ACE_TSS* classes that
          shouldn't have been there, and was erroneously added when the
          code was moved.  Although ACE_TSS probably should be ifdef'd and
          the ACE_TSS_TYPE macros used, that wasn't the purpose of the
          move, so it was set back to the way it was.

        * ace/Free_List.h:
          Added #include os_stddef.h to pick up size_t.  Thanks to John
          Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for submitting this patch.

Mon Aug  4 17:03:55 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Bound_Ptr.i:
          Added #include of Guard_T.h.

        * apps/mkcsregdb/mkcsregdb.cpp:
          Added #include of Log_Msg.h.

        * examples/Export/dll.h:
          Added #include of Null_Mutex.h.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/post_completions.cpp:
          Added #include of Thread_Mutex.h and changed ACE_Thread_Mutex to
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.

        * examples/Smart_Pointers/Gadget_Part.h.
          Added #include Synch_Traits.h and Thread_Mutex.h.

Mon Aug  4 13:56:31 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Synch_T.h:
          Added #include Synch.h to insure backward compatibility on
          non-threaded builds.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
          Added #include ACE.h needed when not inlining.

Mon Aug  4 13:08:29 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
          Moved some additional error code definitions to os_errno.h.
          This will fix compile errors on FreeBSD.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ARPA_INET_H.  This will fix compile problems on
          Windows.

Mon Aug  4 09:31:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Added VxWorks includes for shared library functions.

        * ace/OS.i:
          Implemented access, dlerror and dlopen for VxWorks. There is no
          reference counting on dlopen, when calling it multiple times on
          the same shared lib it will load the same lib multiple times,
          this because VxWorks has no reference counting. Use these with
          care because of the strange VxWorks implementation. Thanks to
          Marc Walrave <marc.walrave@meco.nl> for creating this.

Mon Aug  4 23:47:33 2003  <Ossama Othman <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Array_Base.cpp:

          For MSVC++ 6, include standard C++ <new> header to pull in
          placement new() operator prototype.  Addresses template
          instantiation errors.

Mon Aug  4 22:41:24 2003  <Ossama Othman <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:

          Include "ace/Guard_T.h" to pull in ACE_Guard template
          declaration.

        * ace/MEM_Addr.cpp:

          Include "ace/OS.h" to pull in ACE_OS::strtoul() static function
          prototype.

        * ace/Process_Semaphore.h:

          Include "ace/Semaphore.h" to pull in the ACE_Semaphore class
          declaration for the (ACE_WIN32 || ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM || ACE_PSOS)
          case.

        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:

          Include "ace/ACE.h" to pull in ACE::strnew() function prototype.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:

          Include "ace/ACE.h" to pull in ACE::debug() function prototype.

        * ace/Token.h:

          Fixed compile-time problems in MSVC++ builds.  Some headers must
          still be included for the ACE_TOKEN_USES_SEMAPHORE case.

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:

          Include "ace/Null_Mutex.h" to pull in ACE_Null_Mutex class
          declaration.

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.h:

          Include "ace/Auto_Event.h" to pull in ACE_Auto_Event class
          declaration.

Mon Aug  4 04:28:59 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.cpp:

        * ace/Thread_Mutex.h:
        * ace/Token.{h,i}:
          Added or adjusted placement of #ifdef ACE_HAS_THREADS in order
          to fix compile errors on single threaded builds.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.h:
          Added #include ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h needed for single
          threaded builds.

          Refactored the includes due to Synch changes above.

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Added "__ACE_INLINE__" and ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE to
          PREDEFINES so that the all the includes would show up in the
          doxygen file reference pages.

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h,cpp}:
          Removed the static log_msg_tss_key_ variable from ACE_Log_Msg
          and added a free function in Log_Msg.cpp with a static local
          variable to hold the same value.  The obviates the need to
          include OS.h in Log_Msg.h.

Sun Aug  3 20:55:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_Reassembly_Test.cpp:
        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_UDP_Best_Effort_Test.cpp: #included ACE.h to
          get rid of compile errors in the full reactor build.

Sat Aug  2 17:50:30 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:

          Added #include of ace/Handle_Set.h.

          Malloc.h to OS_String.h and Malloc_Base.h, since that is
          sufficient. Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan for providing the
          patches. This helps to improve the compilation time of ACE and
          its applications that use the above features.

Fri Aug  1 14:55:00 2003  Dan Troesser  <troesser_d@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Added -a (absolute) option to correspond with original
          create_ace_build script.

Fri Aug  1 14:52:17 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Removed the legacy libpaths. They make the log output too long, and
        seem to cause a problem with some nightly builds for some
        unknown reason. We'll just have to be careful not to check in
        mpc-generated files without editing for reverse compatibility.

Fri Aug  1 12:37:59 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Added setting of ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_DL

Fri Aug  1 07:21:39 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a 'forcount' which provides a one based index of the foreach
          iterations.

Fri Aug  1 06:37:39 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where pch files were being picked up even if they did
          not end with a valid extension.

Thu Jul 31 14:22:17 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/property.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtoldevent.mpb:

          Added .disable to the list of files that won't be linked
        by create_ace_build.pl.
          Added legacy libpaths so that generated Makefiles will be
        reverse compatible with existing ones, as a temporary
        workaround until everything is MPC generated.
          Fixed some typos in base mpb files.

Thu Jul 31 13:12:17 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          The KEEP_GOING flag is automatically set now.  It is keyed off of
          the -k option to make.  If -k is passed to make, then KEEP_GOING
          will be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to 0.

Thu Jul 31 11:36:35 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added the ability for the main Makefile to stop after the first
          error.  By default, it moves on to the next makefile when an error
          is encountered.  Now, set the make macro KEEP_GOING to zero to
          have it stop after the first error is encountered.

Thu Jul 31 16:14:30 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/C++NPv2.mpc:
        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.mpc:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/WFMO_Reactor.mpc:
        * examples/Registry/Registry.mpc:
          Added a verbatim tag that ifdef's out the entire Makefile on
          non-Windows systems.  This code can probably be factored out
          into a platform specific template that Windows only project
          inherite. Also, this will probably prevent these project from
          being built with Cygwin and MinGW, since the only test for the
          MAKE variable, not a Windows specific variable.

Thu Jul 31 07:42:57 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * apps/soreduce/Obj_Module.cpp (add_source):
        * apps/soreduce/SO_Group.cpp (add_executable): Fixed bugs where
          application code was being called within ACE_ASSERT macros,
          which were disappearing when ACE_NDEBUG was enabled!  Thanks to
          Roland Meub <roland.meub@gmx.de> for reporting this fix.

Thu Jul 31 01:29:16 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/Export/Export.mpc:
          Added sharedname to library project and libs to executable so
          they would link correctly.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/fifo_sap.mpc:
        * examples/Smart_Pointers/Smart_Pointers.mpc:
          Fixed minor typo's in exename and sourcefile name.

Thu Jul 31 00:49:18 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        These are changes needed in order to use MPC.

        * examples/Registry/test_registry_update.cpp:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/Timer_Service.cpp:
          Modified include order and added ifdef's around WIN32 specific
          code so these projects will compile on non-Windows platforms,
          since MPC doesn't currently allow you to easily exclude projects
          based on platform.

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp:
        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-connector.cpp:
          Removed an unused parameter and added parentheses to fix compile
          warnings and errors.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_multiple_loops.cpp:
          Fixed a capitalization typo in an include, and added an else
          branch to define a main() function.

        * examples/RMCast/Send_File/RMCast_Send_File.mpc:
        * tests/RMCast/acetest.mpb:
          Added a "requires += rmcast" so that these projects would only
          be compiled if libRMCast had been compiled, i.e., rmcast=1.

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/Options.cpp:
          Added ACE_HAS_TRACE macro that gets defined if ACE_NTRACE=0 and
          is used to ifdef away calls to ACE_Trace when not tracing.  This
          removes the need to link in Trace.o for static applications not
          tracing.

          Adjusted includes to reflect the above change by mainly removing
          Trace.h, though in some cases by including Global_Macros.h or
          Trace.h for the two tests.

        * bin/generate_export_file.pl:
          Made the generated code match what's in Global_Macros.h:

        * ace/Select_Reactor.h:
          When ACE_MT_SAFE=0, ifdef away the unused template specilization
          of ACE_Guard<ACE_Select_Reactor_Token_T<ACE_Noop_Token>>.

Wed Jul 30 17:00:03 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Removed erroneous casting of timeLow. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing this out.

Wed Jul 30 02:18:17 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added macros to check for existence of stdint.h and inttypes.h
          and define the appropriate ACE_LACKS_* macro is they are
          missing.

        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h:
          Added check for UNIXWARE_7_1 before defining default values for
          several THR_* macros.  Terletsky Oleg
          <oleg.terletsky@comverse.com> for supplying these patches.

Tue Jul 29 09:59:35 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Changed the #includes to use the ace directory.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added Metrics_Cache.cpp and UUID.cpp.

Tue Jul 29 09:39:58 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcpartialmacros.mpt:

          Added the common.mpt for a place to put common template input
          settings and added an include of common to each template input
          file.

          Remove ACE_ROOT reference in the templates for the depgen.pl
          script.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Change the way the 'implicit' keyword works.  It now takes both
          boolean values and character strings that represent base projects
          for implicitly generated projects.  See the README for more
          details.

        * examples/examples.mwc:

          Utilize the new 'implicit' functionality.

Mon Jul 28 22:00:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/footprint_stats.sh: Added new libraries that were not
          covered.

Mon Jul 28 15:06:32 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.i:

          Fixed typo in preprocessor directive.

Mon Jul 28 19:23:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:
          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG to dump to silence a warning when
          ACE_HAS_DUMP is not defined.

Mon Jul 28 18:29:38 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp:
          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG to dump_i and dump_node_i to silence a
          warning when ACE_HAS_DUMP is not defined.

Mon Jul 28 13:01:49 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.cpp: The implementations are now placed in a namespace
          ACE_Utils. Since we can now use namespaces, adding them to a
          namspace made more sense.

        * ace/UUID.i: File UUID.i is now renamed to be UUID.inl

        * ace/UUID.inl: New file.

        * tests/UUIDTest.cpp: Changes to confirm to the above changes.

Mon Jul 28 12:49:23 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added the ability to uppercase and lowercase strings within the

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Added initial support for Automake.  This is by no means complete
          or even correct, but it's a starting point.  Perhaps someone who
          knows something about Automake could make the automake template
          better (correct).

Mon Jul 28 09:36:15 2003  Gan Deng  <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst

          help reduce footprint for deployed applications that don't use
          dump().  Currently, it is not defined by default.

          working.

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.mpc:
          Changed "dllflags" keyword to "dynamicflags". This was causing
          build errors in Win2K_VC71_NET_DLL Remedy build. Thanks to

Thu Jul 24 14:23:44 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Future.{h,cpp}: Removed the operator new/delete/& so
          that ACE_Future can be stored in STL containers (e.g.,
          sets/maps/etc.).  Thanks to Felix Wyss <FelixW@inin.com>,
          Patrick Bennett <Patrick.Bennett@inin.com>, and Johnny Tucker
          for helping with this.

Fri Jul 25 17:32:58 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Define ACE_DEFAULT_SHLIB_MODE to be RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL
          when ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING, not just for Linux.
          Thanks to Krishnakumar B <kitty@cse.wustl.edu> for suggesting
          this.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx.GNU:  Add with_ld=macosx.
        * include/makeinclude/plafform_g++_common.GNU:
          Don't add "-Wl,-E" to LDFLAGS when with_ld=macosx.  Thanks to
          John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> pointing out the problem
          and supplying a patch.  Also, thanks to Craig Rodrigues
          <crodrigu@bbn.com> for suggesting we set the default for
          with_ld=gnu and only add "-Wl,-E", which id gnu linker
          specific, if we're using the gnu version of ld.

Fri Jul 25 11:37:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added the ability to access grouped source files through the
          template.  The grouped_source_files, grouped_header_files, etc.
          can be used if the files are grouped in the mpc file (as they
          currently are in ace.mpc).

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Utilize the new template ability and remove the 'gnu_source_files'
          and 'build' references and code.

Fri Jul 25 09:17:39 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh:
        * bin/generate_performance_chart.sh: Redefined the range for
          plotting different graphs.

Fri Jul 25 08:53:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh: Changed the path to mogrify. On
          flamenco.dre it is installed in /usr/local instead of
          /usr/bin/X11. This would break the stats pages at UCI. The pages
          at UCI havent been updated in a long while. Hence shouldnt be a
          big deal.

          With this change the thumbnails shold be fine at dre pages.

Fri Jul 25 11:10:21 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Only do a pragma comment with MSVC

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
          Added UUID
        * ace/UUID.h:
          Fixed compile error with Borland

        * ace/UUID.cpp:
          Improved log line.

        * tests/UUIDTest.cpp:
          Fix compile problem in unicode build and ACE_START_TEST to
          get logfile.

        * tests/Tests.bor:
          Added UUIDTest

Fri Jul 25 09:34:11 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Also include nb30.h with MinGW and Borland, but don't do a
          pragma comment with MinGW

        * ace/OS.cpp (getmacaddress):
          Fixed incorrect trace, with Borland and MinGW use a reinterpret
          cast instead of a static cast.

Thu Jul 24 17:32:51 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

        Added:
        $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/examples/Notify/Lanes/run_test.pl: !ST !MINIMUM
        $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/examples/Notify/ThreadPool/run_test.pl: !ST !MINIMUM

Thu Jul 24 16:23:53 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_performance_chart.sh: Changed the scale to which
          the graph is plotted.

Thu Jul 24 14:00:29 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DEV_IO.h (recv_n):
        * ace/DEV_IO.i: The semantics of recv_n () is now changed to have
          a timeout and a byte transferred variable. The interface now has
          the semantics asscoiated with ACE_OS::recv_n () and ACE::recv_n
          () calls. Thanks to Tom Phan <tom.phan@telhub.com>.

Thu Jul 24 15:01:59 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Added check for !static_libs_only before setting LDFLAGS +=
          -Wl,-E, since the static_libs and shared_libs variables aren't
          reset until later in wrapper_macros.GNU, e.g., users can either
          set shared_libs=0 or static_libs_only=1 to turn off shared_libs.

Thu Jul 24 13:56:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Rolled back the part of Wed Jul 23 23:47:52 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com> that changed LDFLAGS in
          platform_linux.GNU, and instead added the same code to
          platform_g++_common.GNU for shared libs only.  This should
          fix the spike in footprint that showed up this morning due to
          yesterday's change.

Thu Jul 24 01:19:59 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * tests/DLL_Test.dsp:
        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.dsp:
          Enabled RTTI so we can test dynamic_cast'ing in a dll.

Wed Jul 23 23:47:52 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Changed ACE_DEFAULT_SHLIB_MODE to be RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL on Linux
          in order to enable dynamic_cast'ing in shared libraries loaded by
          ACE_DLL.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Added -Wl,-E to LDFLAGS to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol
          table in order to enable dynamic_cast'ing in shared libraries
          loaded by ACE_DLL.  Thanks to Milan Cvetkovic
          <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> for reporting this and providing the fix.

        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp:
        * tests/DLL_Test.h:
        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.cpp:
          Added a dynamic_cast test to the existing DLL_Test.

        * THANKS:
          Added Milan Cvetkovic <mcvetkovic@mpathix.com> to the hall of fame.

Wed Jul 23 12:43:48 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Added missing ACE_RCSID macro.

          (UUID_node):

          Use UUID_node::NODE_ID_SIZE instead of the hardcoded constant
          "6".  Improves code maintanability.

          (ACE_UUID):

          Corrected format specifier mismatch warnings in sscanf() call
          exhibited by G++ 3.2.2.  Hexadecimal format specifiers ("%x")
          expect the corresponding argument to be an unsigned int, not a
          signed int.

Wed Jul 23 19:35:27 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * THANKS:
          Added Serkan Unsal <serkan_u2000@yahoo.com> to hall of fame.

Wed Jul 23 18:03:21 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Include os_math.h here so it always gets included before
          ACE.h, since math.h defines log2 as macro that conflicts with
          the method ACE::log2().

        * ace/ace/String_Base.cpp:
          Remove #include "ace/streams.h" and let the cpp's that acutally
          use it include it themselves.  This helps reduce both footprint
          and compile-times.  Thanks to Bala Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> for motivating this change.

Wed Jul 23 17:34:56 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.h:
          Document for ACE_Registry_ImpExp that the value after dword is read
          in hexidecimal format. Thanks to Todd Cooper <todd@DO11073.com> for
          reporting this.

Tue Jul 22 22:46:18 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Fixed a typo in the documentation of read_n ().

Tue Jul 22 23:24:53 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp (ACE_Thread_ID::to_string):
          Fixed WCHAR build errors by making all types char instead of
          ACE_TCHAR and removing ACE_LIB_TEXT macros.

Tue Jul 22 19:20:16 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

          Included the UUID generator files into the project to compile on
          windows.

        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/UUIDTest.dsp:

          Updated tests.dsw to include the corresponding UUIDTest.dsp
          project for the unit test UUIDTest which tests the ACE UUID
          generator.

Tue Jul 22 16:43:01 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i:
          Changed new rand_r() implementation a little bit

Tue Jul 22 15:12:02 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/iosfwd.h:
          Added #include "ace/streams.h" if __APPLE_CC__ is defined.  This
          fixes problems with gperf hanging on MAC OSX.  Thanks to John
          Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for reporting the problem and
          supplying the patch.

Tue Jul 22 14:59:59 UTC 2003 Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Rolled back Wed Jun 18 17:28:25 2003  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu> and added _GNU_SOURCE instead.  If
          _GNU_SOURCE is defined, these defaults plus a few others
          including _XOPEN_SOURCE, get set by default--and defaults can
          and do change over time.  This should also cleanup warnings on
          Debian builds.

Tue Jul 22 10:29:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp: Fixed compile error; #elif should be #else.
        * ace/UUID.cpp: Added #include "ace/Log_Msg.h" to pick up the necessary
          things for doing logging (ACE_DEBUG, etc.).

Tue Jul 22 06:01:03 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Timer_Heap_T.cpp:
        * Timer_List_T.cpp:
        * Timer_Wheel_T.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect ACE_TRACE statements to fix fuzz errors.

Tue Jul 22 05:44:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i:
          Added an implementation for rand_r() on Win32. Thanks to
          Kees van Marle <kvmarle@remedy.nl> for noticing the lack of this
          implementation.

Tue Jul 22 00:19:39 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Added #include "ace/streams.h" to resolve compile error.

Mon Jul 21 22:57:54 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added check for "/**/" comment in pre.h/post.h includes.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for motivating this.

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
        * ace/Strategies.h:
        * ace/UUID.h:
        * docs/tutorials/022/Acceptor_Service.h:
        * Kokyu/*.h:
          Added comment that adding "/**/" between the #include and the
          filenames in order to improve doxygen documentation.

Mon Jul 21 22:52:46 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Moved #include <net/if_arp.h> from OS.h to OS.cpp. This
          should resolve the compile errors on solaris.

Mon Jul 21 08:59:14 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp (get_systemtime):

          Temporary fix to get the compiles rolling again.

Mon Jul 21 01:56:44 2003  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Added method getmacaddress () to get the mac address of the host
          for generating UUIDs

          Added to_string () method to ACE_Thread_ID class to create a
          string representation of ACE_Thread_ID.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:

          Included file nb30.h and library netapi32.lib required for
          obtaining MACaddress on windows.

        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.cpp:
        * ace/UUID.i:

          Files added to generate UUID (Universally Unique ID) based on
          expired IETF draft titled "UUIDs and GUIDs". Modifications were
          made to the UUID generation as defined by the specification to
          add thread and process ids. This was done by adding a new
          variant 0xc0 not defined by the specification. By default only
          the time variant version of the UUID as defined by the spec is
          generated.

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
        * tests/UUIDTest.cpp:

          Simple test added to verify ACE UUID generation.

Sun Jul 20 14:14:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/NT_Service.i (ACE_NT_Service): Set dwWaitHint to 0 in the
          constructor.  Thanks to Emiliano Berenbaum <eberenb@yahoo.com>
          for reporting this.

Fri Jul 18 18:59:46 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Clarified that ACE+TAO no longer build with
          MSVC++ 5.x or earlier.  Thanks to Amol Tambe
          <Amol.Tambe@ideas.com> for reporting this.

Sat Jul 19 18:38:50 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html:
          Added comment that adding "/**/" between the #include and the
          file name prevents Doxygen from including the file in the file
          reference tree graphs, and should be used with pre.h and
          post.h--which makes the large ones much easier to understand.

        * tests/Service_Config_DLL.h:
          Added "/**/" between the #include and filename for pre.h and
          post.h so Doxygen won't include them in the file reference tree
          graphs.

Fri Jul 18 17:58:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Asynch_IO.h:
        * ace/Local_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Service_Types.h:
          Fixed doxygen warnings.

Fri Jul 18 10:36:51 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * THANKS: Added Dieter Knppel <dknueppel@datus.com> to the
          contributors list.

Thu Jul 17 15:02:56 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/C++NPv1/Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Added #include "ace/streams.h".

Thu Jul 17 12:49:39 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * examples/NT_Service/main.cpp:

Thu Jul 17 06:21:30 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the name of borland projects to just be the project name
          .bor.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the default workspace names for nmake and borland to
          Makefile.  Additionally, I added an option (-make_coexistence)
          to allow the gnuace, nmake and borland types to coexist.  This
          option causes the default workspace names for nmake and borland to
          work as they previously had.  The nmake workspace would be
          workspace name .nmake and the borland workspace would be named
          Makefile.bor.

Wed Jul 16 15:29:37 2003  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Fixed to link include/makeinclude/*.bor files.
          A few more link exclusions were added.

Wed Jul 16 15:27:37 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h (find_handler):

          Pure virtual specifier for find_handler() was a cut and paste
          error.

          Switched ssl over to use the feature based style instead of the
          template style.  Now, the ssl related libraries will only be added
          to the generated projects if the ssl feature is enabled.

          Switched the zzip configuration information over to use the
          feature based style instead of doing it within the templates.
          Now, to enable zzip use the -feature_file option to specify a file
          that has 'zzip=1' and 'zlib=1'.  For more information on the
          -feature_file option see the README.
           (or use bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features)

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/zziplib.mpt:

        * ace/iosfwd.h:
          Removed all references to ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION.
          It was used to include ace/iosfwd.h instead of ace/streams.h,
          but files should only include one they need instead of always
          including ace/streams.h, which includes <iostream> if available
          and unnecesarily increases compile times.  Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan
          <coryan@atdesk.com> motivating this.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
          Removed the #ifdefs for ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION and
          always include ace/iosfwd.h.

        * ace/OS_Log_Msg_Attributes.h:
          Replaced include of ace/streams.h with ace/iosfwd.h in order
          to improve compile times

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp:

Tue Jul 16 11:43:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Some tests where based on aceexe, changes this to acetest. This
          fixes problems with vc71.

Tue Jul 15 06:22:55 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/zlib.mpb:

          Added the zlib feature (disabled by default).  This will allow
          users to enable the zlib feature and pull in include paths, lib
          paths and library which will be dependent upon the ZLIB_ROOT
          environment variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where false warnings would be displayed if
          MPC_VERBOSE_ORDERING was set.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added a rule to create the libout directory.
          Fixed a bug in the gnu template that only affected TAO libraries
          that had 'requires' or 'avoids'.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Fixed a problem with cppflags and dependencies.

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Ignore unknown options instead of causing an error.

        * bin/ChangeLogEditor/FileLocator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the correct CVSROOT value wasn't being used.

        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h:
          When building for VxWorks also include errnoLib.h

        * ace/OS.cpp (inet_aton):
          Fixed VxWorks specific implementation. Thanks to Eric Held
          <Eric.Held@harris.com> for reporting this, this fixes bugzilla
          entry [1484]

        * THANKS:
          Added Eric Held <Eric.Held@harris.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Removed windows specific use of cmd. This is not needed and
          causes problems when using MinGW with the MSYS shell on windows.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:
          Threading compiles with cygwin again, so no need anymore to set
          threads to 0 when not defined.

        * ChangeLog:
          Fixed fuzz errors about backslashed in file path

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp:
          Removed not needed newline.

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:
          Fixed typo in comment

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          The FIFO_Test doesn't run with Cygwin.

Mon Jul 14 11:16:25 2003  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: FreeBSD defines the sysconf value
          for _SC_AIO_LISTIO_MAX to 16, and the sysconf value for
          _SC_AIO_MAX to be 1024.  The lower value must be assigned to
          aiocb_list_max_size_ otherwise aio_suspend() will fail.  There
          was already already some logic in here to support HPUX that also
          works for FreeBSD, so use that.

Sat Jul 12 17:55:14 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

Mon Jul 07 18:00:38 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * The following changes are related to improving memory management
          of Event Handlers when they interact with Reactors (and Timer
          Queues).  When a handler is registered with the Reactor, the
          Reactor increments the reference count on the handler.  The
          Reactor also increments this reference count when making upcalls
          on the handler.  The reference count is decremented when an
          upcall completes or when the handler is removed from the
          Reactor.

          This mechanism is similar to what happens between POAs and
          Servants and it allows for the safe deletion of handlers.  This
          mechanism is particularly need for multi-threaded applications
          that can have multiple threads executing upcalls on a handler
          that needs to be shutdown in a safe manner.  The following
          illustrates an example of how this mechanism works:

          - When a handler is created, it reference count is one.

          - After the handler is registered with the Reactor, it reference
          count becomes two.

          - At this point, the handler creator can let go of the handler
          reference, bringing down the reference count to one.

          - For each thread executing upcalls on the handler, the Reactor
          increments the reference count by one. So if three threads were
          simultaneously making upcalls on a handler, the reference count
          would be four.

          - Assuming an external event (and thread) decides to close the
          handler.  It simply removes the handler from the Reactor.  This
          decreases the reference count to three.

          - As each thread completes their upcall, the reference reduces.

          - Once the final thread exits the upcall, the reference reaches
          zero, and the handler is finally deleted.

          This mechanism ensures that the handler is not deleted until the
          final upcall thread exits the handler.

          Reference counting on handlers is optional and is disabled by
          default.  To enable reference counting on a handler, reset its
          reference counting policy to "ENABLED".

          To facilitate reference counting of handlers, an
          ACE_Event_Handler_var class was added.  This class is akin to
          the PortableServer::ServantBase_var class.

          Similar reference counting related changes were made to the
          Timer Queues so that handlers can be used in a thread safe
          manner with the queues.

          The Connector implementation was completely revised to utilize
          the new memory management mechanisms and remove existing
          concurrency bugs.

          Several new examples/tests were added:

          - tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test
          - tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test
          - tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test
          - tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test
          - tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test
          - tests/Reactor_Registration_Test
          - tests/WFMO_Reactor_Test
          - tests/Timer_Cancellation_Test

          Details follow below:

        Fri May 09 20:13:37 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Event_Handler:

          Added reference counting capabilities to the event handler.  The
          reference counting will be used for event handler memory
          management by Reactors that will call add_reference() and
          remove_reference() during registrations, removals, and upcalls.
          This mechanism is similar to the protocol between servants and
          POAs.

          Reference counting is configurable and can be controlled by the
          Reference_Counting_Policy which is disabled by default.

          Added a ACE_Event_Handler_var auto pointer like class for
          Event Handlers.  This class calls
          ACE_Event_Handler::remove_reference() in its destructor.

          Added reactor_timer_interface() method that returns the
          Reactor's timer related interface.

        * ace/Reactor_Timer_Interface.h:

          Added a new class ACE_Reactor_Timer_Interface that contains
          timer related (pure virtual) methods of the Reactor.  This
          allows us to make timer related calls on the Reactor from the
          Timer Queue without having to include Reactor.h.

      * ace/Reactor:

          Vastly improved documentation, specially with respect to how the
          reference counting works.

          Made the Reactor class inherit from ACE_Reactor_Timer_Interface
          so that timer related calls can be made on the Reactor from the
          Timer Queue without having to include Reactor.h.

        * ace/Reactor:
        * ace/Reactor_Impl:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor:

          Added a new find_handler() method that returns the event handler
          associated with a <handle>.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:

          - bind(): Make sure that the user is not registering a different
          handler for an existing handle in the
          Reactor_Handler_Repository.  Also, if it is a new entry, call
          add_reference() if reference counting is needed.

          - unbind(): Call remove_reference() if the removal is complete
          and reference counting is needed. Also, Bala's change:

          Mon Apr  7 16:58:55 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          is no longer necessary since handle_close() is now only called
          once the Reactor state has been completely updated.

          - mask_ops(): If the handle is not suspended, then set the ops
          on the <wait_set_>, otherwise set the <suspend_set_>.

          - handler_i(): Add to reference count of event handler before
          returning to the user if reference counting is needed.

          - ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::dispatch_notify():
          - ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::purge_pending_notifications():
          - ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::notify():

          Added reference counting for notifies.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T:

          notify_handle(): Added reference counting to upcalls.

        * ace/TP_Reactor:

          - remove_handler(): All remove_handler() specializations can be
          removed since there no longer is the requirement of calling
          handle_close() from outside the Reactor lock.

          - handle_timer_events(): Call preinvoke() and postinvoke() on
          the timer queue so that timer upcalls can be reference counted.

          - handle_socket_events(): Added reference counting to upcalls.

          - mask_ops(): Specialization no longer necessary since the base
          class now does the right thing.

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor:

          - handler(): Original handler() method was not locked.

          - bind_i(): Call add_reference() if reference counting is
          needed.

          - make_changes_in_current_infos():
          - make_changes_in_suspension_infos():
          - make_changes_in_to_be_added_infos():

          The iteration loop was incorrect.  When an entry was replaced
          from the one at the end, the newly shifted entry was skipped and
          not evaluated.  make_changes_in_to_be_added_infos() did not need
          this change since entries are not moved around in the
          <to_be_added_info_> set.

          Also, call remove_reference() if reference counting if needed.

          - complex_dispatch_handler(): Added reference counting to
          upcalls.

          - ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Notify::purge_pending_notifications():
          - ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Notify::notify():
          - ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Notify::handle_signal():

          Added reference counting for notifies.

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T:

          - Not sure why we were including Test_and_Set.h when we only
          needed to include Event_Handler.h.

          - dispatch_info() and dispatch_info_i(): Made these virtual so
          that they can be specialized.

          - ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T: Added <recurring_timer_> so
          that we can determine if we need to call remove_reference() if
          it is not a recurring timer and if reference counting is
          required.  This value is passed to the timeout() method of the
          upcall functor.

          - timeout(): When handle_timeout() returns -1, invoke
          cancel_timer() on the reactor if the event handler has a valid
          reactor, otherwise invoke cancel() on the timer queue.  It is
          necessary to get the same locking as was used when registering
          the timer, which was potentially done holding the reactor lock
          while the timer queue could have been configured with a null
          lock.

          - schedule():  No longer a pure virtual method.  It now grabs
          the lock, call schedule_i(), and finally calls registration() on
          the upcall functor.

          - registration(): This method is called when a timer is
          registered.

          - preinvoke(): Invokes add_reference() on the event handler if
          reference counting is required before making the upcall.

          - upcall(): Changed the signature to pass
          ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T instead of the individual
          parameters.

          - postinvoke(): Invokes remove_reference() on the event handler
          if reference counting is required after making the upcall.

          - cancel_type() and cancel_timer(): Split cancellation() into
          two methods.  cancel_timer() is called when a timer is
          cancelled.  cancel_type() is called when a handler is
          cancelled. Also added <dont_call> parameter to these method.
          cancel_timer() will be used for reference counting and
          cancel_type() will be used for calling handle_close().

          - expire(): Call preinvoke() before calling upcall() and
          postinvoke() after calling upcall().

          - deletion(): Now calls cancel_type() and cancel_timer() for
          each timer remaining in the queue.

        * ace/Timer_List_T:
        * ace/Timer_Wheel_T:
        * ace/Timer_Heap_T:
        * ace/Timer_Hash_T:

          - schedule_i(): This method replaces the old schedule() method.
          Locking is not necessary anymore.

          - cancel(): This method will call cancel_timer() once for each
          timer cancelled and cancel_type() once for each handler
          cancelled.

          - cancel_i(): The <skip_close> check will be performed in the
          upcall functor.

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T:

          - ~ACE_Timer_Heap_T(): Don't use <cur_size_> for the for loop
          since it reduces after free_node() is called.

          - cancel(): Not sure why this is the only cancel() where the
          upcall is made outside the lock.

        * ace/Timer_Wheel_T:

          - expire(): Made this method similar to Timer_Queue_T::expire()
          by (a) invoking preinvoke() before calling upcall() and invoking
          postinvoke() after calling upcall() and (b) making sure that we
          skip past time values that have already "expired" when
          rescheduling.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T:

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall: Updated this upcall functor to match
          the new APIs.

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::registration():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::cancel_type():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::cancel_timer():

          Nothing to be done in these methods since
          registration/cancellation will be handled by the upcall functor
          of the timer hash.

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::preinvoke():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::postinvoke():
          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::preinvoke():

          Assert that these methods never get invoked since we don't
          invoke expire() on the buckets.

          - ACE_Timer_Hash_Upcall::deletion(): Call up to the upcall
          functor of the timer hash since the timer hash does not invoke
          deletion() on its upcall functor directly.  This is because
          entries are actually registered with the buckets, and this
          method will be invoked when the buckets are cleaned up.

          - Hash_Token: Added TYPE information to the token.  This
          required templatizing Hash_Token since TYPE is a template
          parameter.

          - reschedule(): Cancel the old timer before registering the new
          one.  Otherwise, the old timer will always remain in the
          buckets.  Also, make sure that the new bucket position is noted.

          - dispatch_info_i(): This method needs to be specialized to give
          the original act and not the modified act.

          - free_node(): Needs to cancel the timer in addition to freeing
          the node.

          - expire(): Only call cancel() for timers that don't need to be
          rescheduled.  reschedule() takes care of removing the old timer
          for timers that need to be rescheduled.  Also, made this method
          similar to Timer_Queue_T::expire() by invoking preinvoke()
          before calling upcall() and invoking postinvoke() after calling
          upcall().

        * ace/Proactor:

          Updated ACE_Proactor_Handle_Timeout_Upcall upcall functor to
          match the new APIs.

        * ace/Connector:

          Completely reworked the Connector to utilize the reference
          counting provided by the Reactor.  This new design fixes bugs
          1405 and 1408.

          - There used to be a hash map that mapped handles to service
          handlers.  There is no need for this map since the Reactor
          already keeps this mapping.  We now keep a simple handle set to
          remember the non-blocking connects in progress.  This will help
          when the Connector is closing down and we need to cancel the
          non-blocking connections in progress.

          - The Connector no longer needs to inherit from
          ACE_Service_Object since it does not register with the Reactor.
          We now use ACE_NonBlocking_Connect_Handler for handling
          non-blocking connects. The resume(), suspend(), and init()
          no-ops, and fini() and info() were removed.

          - The <mutex_> is no longer needed since we use the Reactor lock
          to do all our synchronization.  This will solve bug 1408.

          - We no longer need the <closing_> flag.

          - Need to add a <reactor_> field since the Connector is no
          longer an event handler.

          - Reference counting of ASTs is no longer needed since event
          handlers are reference counted.

          Thanks to Andrew Voumard <andrewv@melbpc.org.au> for helping
          with this.

        * tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test:

          This test is used to check reference counting of the Event
          Handler when it interacts with the Reactor.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test:

          This test tries to represents what happens in the TAO ORB wrt to
          event handlers, reactors, timer queues, threads, and connection
          caches, minus the other complexities.  The following three
          Reactors are tested: Select, TP, and WFMO.

          The test checks proper use and shutting down of client-side
          event handlers when it is used by invocation threads and/or
          event loop threads.  Server-side event handlers are either
          threaded or reactive. A purger thread is introduced to check the
          connection recycling and cache purging.  Nested upcalls are also
          tested.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test:

          This test is used to check reference counting of the event
          handlers when it interacts with the reactor notification
          mechanism.

        * tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test:

          New test is used to check reference counting of the Event
          Handler when it interacts with Timer Queues.

          Added new tests:

          - MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test
          - NonBlocking_Conn_Test

          - WFMO_Reactor_Test

        * tests/Conn_Test.cpp:

          Updated template instantiations.

        * tests/icc.bat:
        * tests/run_tests.bat:
        * tests/run_tests.psosim:

          Removed this file since it has become obsolete.

        Wed May 14 17:56:13 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/OS.i:

          - event_timedwait(): For relative times, the <timeout> parameter
          was being modified.  Instead use a stack variable such that the
          <timeout> parameter is not modified.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T:

          - expire(): Remove nodes from the buckets instead of simply
          getting them and canceling them later.  Also, if timers were
          expired, find the new earliest time.

          - reschedule(): No need to cancel the timer node since it is now
          removed from the bucket in expire().

          - free_node(): No need for this function since nodes are removed
          from the bucket in expire().

          - cancel(): No need to pass <act> to bucket's cancel() since the
          act comes from the Hash Token.  Also, only perform upcall and
          related cleanup on successful bucket cancel.

          - Added asserts in the code since there is not enough error
          checking (and recovery) going on.

        * ace/Reactor:
        * ace/Reactor_Impl:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor:

          Renamed handler() to find_handler() since ACE_HANDLE is an "int"
          on UNIX platforms and that causes ambiguity between
          handler(ACE_HANDLE) and handler(int).

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp (unbind):

          unbind() and bind(): Minor fixes for UNIX specific code.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.cpp:

          Added template instantiation for ACE_Auto_Array_Ptr<sockaddr_in>.

        * ace/Connector.cpp:

          cancel() and close(): Changed calls from Reactor::handler() to
          Reactor::find_handler().

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp:

          Added template instantiations.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:

          - main(): Added code to ignore SIGPIPE.

          - test(): Converted this into template class so that multiple
          instances of reactor implementation can be created.

          - Added additional asserts.

        Thu May 15 18:12:10 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor (find_handler):

          Fixed minor oversights.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:
        * ace/Connector.cpp:

          Fixed unused arg warnings.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:

          - Added a Pipe class. It is a replica of the ACE_Pipe class.
          Only difference is that this class always uses two sockets to
          create the pipe, even on platforms that support pipes.

          - Removed some test cases that don't work on Linux.

        Tue May 20 18:33:07 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Connector:

          Reverted the Connector to inherit from ACE_Service_Object again.
          Even though the Connector no longer registers with the Reactor,
          it still needs to inherit from ACE_Service_Object so that it can
          be used through the Service Configurator primarily for dynamic
          linking.  The resume(), suspend(), and init() no-ops, and fini()
          and info() were restated.

        Mon Jun 30 16:31:33 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL_LIB.dsp:

          Fixed the project names - they should be:

          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Static Release"
          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Static Debug"

          instead of:

          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Release"
          # Name "ACE_SSL_LIB - Win32 Debug"

        Wed Jul 02 15:31:33 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.cpp:

          handle_close() on the Connector was being specialized to know
          when the connection was not successful.  This is not the correct
          approach in the first place since one should look for close() on
          the service handler.  In addition, handle_close() is no longer
          used by ACE_Connector.  Therefore, I changed this to use close()
          on the service handler.

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Caching/http_handler.h:

          Included "ace/Svc_Handler.h" explicitly.

        * examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp:

          Included "ace/Test_and_Set.h" explicitly since
          ace/Timer_Queue_T.h is no longer including it.

        Thu Jun 26 17:36:13 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Added -tests_TAO and -examples_TAO options to make all projects
          in TAO tests and TAO examples.

        Thu May 22 14:13:37 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * Merged Reactor_RefCount branch with the main truck since all ACE
          level changes are now complete.  New branch is
          Reactor_RefCount_1.

        Tue May 27 19:59:25 2003  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * Merged Reactor_RefCount_1 branch with the main truck to avail
          new changes by Bala to the TAO connection handlers.  New branch
          is Reactor_RefCount_2.

Mon Jul  7 12:38:01 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp: Updated the implementation of all the
          dequeue_*() methods so that the "next_" and "prev_" pointer of
          the dequeue'd message block are set to 0.  Failure to do this
          can cause weird behavior when a dequeue'd message block is
          passed to ACE::write_n().... Thanks to Wenlong Tang
          <tang_long@hotmail.com> for reporting this.

Mon Jul  7 11:14:02 2003  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_structure/any_op_cs.cpp (visit_enum):

          Fixed a cut and paste error that was causing the code generation
          for the any operators in the stub source file to be skipped. Thanks
          to <dyafe@itgil.com> for reporting the bug.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_enum/any_op_cs.cpp:

          Fixed cut and paste error in the explicit template instantiation.

          target.

Sun Jul  6 09:55:16 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Task.cpp: Fixed compile errors with MSVC 7.1 when
          ACE_HAS_ANSI_CAST  and RTTI is turned on. Thanks to Marek Brudka
          <M.Brudka@elka.pw.edu.pl> for providing the patch.

        * THANKS: Added Marek to the hall of fame.

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:

          Added the TAO_RTSCHEDULER_CFLAGS flag to build RTSCheduler
          library using Borland compiler.

Fri Jul  4 07:29:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Added support for the -pipe command line option of the g++ compiler
          on Win32. This uses pipes instead of intermediate files and speeds up
          the compilation. This is enabled by default but can be disabled by
          adding pipes=0 to your platform_macros.GNU file. Thanks to
          Serge Kolgan <skolgan@trigraph.com> for this suggestion.

Thu Jul  3 22:05:58 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h:
          Moved the ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SETSTACK definition to os_pthread.h
          along with all the other pthread related definitions.  This
          should help eliminate warnings about using a the deprecated
          function pthread_attr_setstackaddr.

Thu Jul 03 17:00:47 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client.mpb: Added "security"

Wed Jul  2 23:58:11 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
          FreeBSD 5.1 implements <stdint.h> (ACE_LACKS_STDINT_H) and
          reentrant password functions (ACE_LACKS_PWD_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS).
          rand_r has been implemented for quite some time now
          (ACE_LACKS_RAND_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS).

          Rolled back Wed Jul  2 22:17:15 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com> temporarily, since it is defined
          inconsistently and compilation will fail if ACE_HAS_ANSI_CASTS is
          just defined and not defined as a number.

Wed Jul  2 22:17:15 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-all.h/
          Added test for ACE_HAS_ANSI_CASTS != 0, not just its existence

Wed Jul  2 13:16:14 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/config-doxygen.h:
          Added define of __ACE_INLINE__ so that inlining will be turned
          on in order to help identify unwanted inter-header dependencies.

Tue Jul  1 20:47:35 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          Added include of os_stdio.h.  This picks up FILENAME_MAX on
          Windows and fixes an alignment problem with ACE_PI_Control_Block
          due to differing definitions for MAXNAMELEN.  Thanks to
          Serge Kolgan <skolgan@trigraph.com> for help figuring this out.

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_SYS_UN_H and ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_H.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_mman.h:

        * ace/QtReactor.h:
        * ace/QtReactor.cpp:

          The QtReactor works by semi-unifying the Qt Event loop with the
          Reactor event loop.  Most of the time, the Qt Event loop is the
          dominant loop, but occasionally, when wait_for_multiple_events
          gets called, the reactor loop becomes the dominant loop.

          Previous QtReactor implementations only overloaded
          register_handler, caused them to never notice when an
          application changed the mask on a previously-registered handler,
          e.g., via ACE_Reactor::schedule_wakeup.  Thus, the Qt event loop
          never knew about the new interest or lack thereof, and didn't
          call it back.

          This newer version overloads ACE_Reactor::bit_ops, and tweaks
          the registrations with the Qt event loop according to bit_ops'
          arguments' mask operations.  This *should* allow us to catch
          every twiddling of masks, although there is no comprehensive
          regression test for this for any kind of reactor.

          From inspection, it appears as if the XtReactor might need
          similar changes.

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Added ace/pre.h and ace/post.h to the exclude list.  This will
          clean up the file dependency graphs a bit and make the more
          complex ones a bit easier to read.

          Updated MPC with the latest features and changes from OCI's repo. Created
        new mpb base projects to make mpc files as simple as possible, and updated
        existing mpb base projects. Added and updated mpc files to use the latest
        features and make use of base projects.
          Added the create_ace_build.pl script that is more MPC friendly and works
        on Windows.
          Removed unused nightly.mwc.
          Note : The new MPC base projects will now output all library files to
        consistent locations across platforms. This is controlled by the three
        files acelib.mpb, tao_output.mpb, and orbsvcs_output.mpb using the
        libout keyword. Currently all of these are set to output to $ACE_ROOT/lib.
        All libraries will be placed in this directory, including .dll files on
        Windows. This means that Windows users will have to add %ACE_ROOT%\lib to
        their %PATH%. This is analogous to %LD_LIBRARY_PATH% on Unix.

          <dhinton@dresystems.com> which made ACE_DLL member variable a
          reference as part of subsetting, which caused
          Service_Config_Test to fail.

          pthread_mutex_timedlock() declaration to os_pthread.h.

        * tests/Makefile.tests:
          Added special build rule when on hpux that changes the link
          order, i.e., main.o comes before x_Test.o.  Hopefully this
          will clear up linker errors on Hp with the gcc compiler that
          started appearing after the tests directory was reorganized.

Tue Jun 24 15:47:16 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client.mpb: Added
          $(CIAO_ROOT)/ciao to idlflags.

          Added $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs/orbsvcs to libpaths and linking
          Security to even a simple stub DLL because of the way
          components.idl is being set up.  (Hint: we really don't need
          them.)

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_component.mpb: Reorganized
          the template since I moved some of the libraries to ciao_client
          to fix the components.idl definition problem.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb: Added this new
          template to isolate customize CIDL rules for servant DLLs.  It
          turned out they also requires the stuff defined in the
          Deployment module (thus, the CIAO_Server library.)

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd: Added code to define
          CIAO_ROOT in Makefiles if it's not defined already.

          Thanks to Chad Elliott for helping me setting up the custom
          rules for CIDL compiler and answering my tons of questions.

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Broke out the Naming Service flat-file persistence tests and
          added a new Redundant Naming Service test.  Both these tests
          are disabled on mininum CORBA.

          Removed include of OS.h and/or ACE.h from headers and adjusted
          includes in headers and other files by including appropriate
          headers in order to reduce dependencies as part of the
          subsetting effort.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/Asynch_IO.cpp:
        * ace/Asynch_IO.h:
          Changed u_long to unsigned long to help remove dependencies.
          Moved the typedef for TRANSMIT_FILE_BUFFERS here from OS.h.

        * ace/Functor.h:
        * ace/Functor.i:
          Changed u_long to unsigned long to help remove dependencies.

        * ace/OS.h:

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (PLATFORM_SSL_CPPFLAGS):

          Some Linux OpenSSL installations compile in Kerberos support.
          Add the Kerberos include path to preprocessor include path.
          Fixes build problems on Red Hat 9 installations.  Note that this
          is an interim fix.

Fri Jun 20 10:07:39 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Switch this to be a project instead of a feature.  It doesn't hurt
          to inherit from it if you don't use the MOC_Files component.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:

          Added + and - to the escape_regex_special() method.

Fri Jun 20 09:52:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added inheritance from qt_moc and qt_reactor.  These will only be
          processed if the 'qt' feature is enabled.

        * ace/qt_reactor.mpb:

          Added QtReactor_moc.cpp to the list of files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added inheritance from the qt base project.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt.mpb:

          Contains the basic feature definition for qt libs and apps.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Contains the custom definition for MOC files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ArrayHandle.pm:

          Removed this file.  It isn't necessary anymore.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the way feature files are read.  This new way is better
          and less hacky.

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Don't modify the file if no precompiled header is found.

Fri Jun 20 14:28:12 UTC 2003  Johnny WIllemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Updated this file because of the os splitting.

Fri Jun 20 09:08:05 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Fixed the usage to display the correct options.

Fri Jun 20 08:54:29 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added code to process type specific assignments that may be
          defined within a feature.

Fri Jun 20 08:10:11 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added documentation about the new feature project type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          Defaulted the qt feature to disabled.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ArrayHandle.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          The majority of the code for handling feature project went in
          here.  One main thing that was changed is that instead of using
          the <$fh> paradigm to read files, the following is used
          $_ = $fh->getline().  This is compatible with the new ArrayHandle
          module that I added.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Options.pm:

          Added a missing space in the completion command.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the code to match some new methods added in Creator and
          ProjectCreator.

Thu Jun 19 13:03:49 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the BUILD target wouldn't be updated when the
          project had component requirements.

Thu Jun 19 12:14:31 2003  Gan Deng <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst

          Added the latency tests for sequences of various data types.

Thu Jun 19 11:36:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Updated the GNUACE template to issue information as to why a
          particular project wasn't built based on the comps, requires and
          avoids values.

Thu Jun 19 12:18:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:

        * ace/os_include/os_stdio.h:
          Moved include of remLib.h to os_stdio.h, and uncommented
          sysLib.h since it is needed for sysClkRateGet().  Thanks to Rod
          Andzik <andzik@rtlogic.com> for help tracking this down.

        * ace/os_include/os_netdb.h:
          Removed the VXWORKS tests for hostent and servent.

Thu Jun 19 07:50:04 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug with multiple 'specific' scopes in a single project.

Thu Jun 19 07:13:16 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Documented the existing 'specific' keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to specify multiple project types with the
          'specific' scope.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Removed ACESHLIB from the lit_libs assignment.

Thu Jun 19 12:04:28 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/Default_Constants.h:
          Added guards around ACE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
          ACE_LD_SEARCH_PATH_SEPARATOR_STR.  Thanks to John Michael
          Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for reporting the problem.

Thu Jun 19 07:01:57 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h: Since LynxOS lacks sys/select.h and
          dlfcn.h header files, config file needs ACE_LACKS_DLFCN_H
          and ACE_LACKS_SYS_SELECT_H to be defined. Thanks to  Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for the patch.

Thu Jun 19 06:35:26 2003  John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net>

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Patches to get ACE building on OSX10.2
          again.

Thu Jun 19 00:27:38 2003  Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timeprobe.h:
        * ace/Timeprobe.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.h:

          Advanced new timeprobe. New features are a
          ring buffer for elements kept in data structure.
          This eliminates the ACE_ASSERT when an element
          is attempted to be inserted into a full data
          structure. Old data is overwritten until the
          cache is read and cleared.

          Timeprobes now include a second argument to
          allow for an ACE_ALLOCATOR. This allocator allows
          for the data structure that will contain the
          ACE_Timeprobes to be done in the constructor. A
          new function called 'increase_size' allows for
          the data structure to increase the number of
          measurements it can take. It does so by creating a
          new structure with the new size and copying the
          elements from the old structure.

        * ace/Makefile.ace:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache.cpp:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache.h:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache.i:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache_T.cpp:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache_T.h:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache_T.i:

          Added new Metrics Cache.

        * ACE/ace/OS.h:

          Added two new macros called ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN
          and ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY. ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN
          returns an array of class pointers with their space
          preallocated and each entry initialized. If there is
          an error the value contained in RET_VAL is returned.
          ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY is the same but there is no
          return of a value if there is an error.

Wed Jun 18 21:27:44 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/exceptions.html: Added documentation for the

Wed Jun 18 17:20:28 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp:
        * ace/Log_Record.h (print): Changed the 3rd argument to be of type
          ACE_OSTREAM_TYPE instead of ostream.

        * ace/ace/config-sunos5.5.h: Added ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS and
          removed ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRES_SOURCE.

          Thanks to Keith Snively <ksnively@d-a-s.com> and J. Russell
          Noseworthy <j.russell.noseworthy@objectsciences.com> for
          providing these patches.

Wed Jun 18 15:59:18 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Added includes of os_fcntl.h, os_netdb.h, os_semaphore.h,
          os_signal.h, os_stdio.h, os_stdlib.h, os_stropts.h, os_unistd.h,
          arpa/os_inet.h, sys/select.h, and sys/os_socket.h to the VxWorks
          section.  All the includes in OS.h will be reorganized once the
          builds stabalize.

        * ace/OS.h:
          Commented out remLib.h and sysLib.h since they don't appear to
          be used by ACE at all.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6ProjectCreator.pm:

          For custom defined values, convert $(...) to the corresponding
          environment variable accessor, if it is required.  Custom builds
          done in the MS based IDE's are placed in a batch file and then
          executed.  For this particular case, $(...) doesn't work so we
          convert the values on assignment.

          with precompiled headers.

Tue Jun 17 14:42:25 2003  Gautam H. Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp:

          Change was necessary for build on RH 9.0 to work properly.

          ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex and also changed the
          ACE_Condition_Thread_Mutex to

          deadlock.  Thanks to Thomas Groth <groth.th@nord-com.net> for
          providing these patches.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp (symbol): Added missing newlines in
