        * ace/DLL.h:
        * ace/DLL_Manager.h: Corrected and expanded the descriptions of how
          DLL/library names are handled, decorated, and located.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:
          In handle_events(), if returning -1 because the reactor isn't
          ready to handle events, also set errno to ESHUTDOWN to tell the
          caller why. Fixes Bugzilla #3974.

Thu May 12 18:08:47 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Added command settings for
          preprocessing C and C++ source files.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Added rules to preprocess
          C and C++ files when directed.
        
          These allow one to now quickly produce a preprocessed version of
          a source file. Ala... make -f GNUmakefile.ACE ACE.i
          would preprocess ACE.cpp and put the result in ACE.i.

Fri Apr 29 14:01:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc: For Message_Queue_Test add -bmaxdata:0x20000000 to
          linker options to extend the available data space at run time.
          Avoids the heap smashing the stacks.

Fri Apr 22 15:19:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Add support for XL C++ 11.

Mon Feb 28 20:29:59 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Event_Analyzer.cpp:
        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/Event_Analyzer.cpp: Replaced the
          name "mod_name" with "module_name" to avoid a clash with macro
          defined in /usr/include/sys/stropts.h encountered when optimized
          build was done.

Mon Feb 28 18:10:19 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Remove the -qfuncsect
          option from CCFLAGS; it caused an occasional odd problem and the
          only reason it was added (Jul 17 2002) was to try and remove
          duplicate symbol diagnostics from template instantiations.
          Thanks to Phil Mesnier for raising this issue and identifying
          the fix.

Tue Feb  1 14:28:18 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.cpp (operator+=): Add a temporary for the return
          value to quiet an IBM XL C++ 10 optimizer warning about returning
          the address of a temporary. No, I'm not kidding.

Wed Jan 26 20:17:28 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: If XL C/C++ 10.1 is used,
          use the same compiler options as for XL C/C++ 9.

Fri Jan 21 17:04:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Set ACE_LACKS_(STR|WCS)TO[U]LL when
          the requisite long-long compiler settings are missing. Enables
          use of these functions when they're available.

        * m4/ace_func.m4: Remove the parts of ACE_FUNC_WCSTOLL and
          ACE_FUNC_WCSTOULL that set ACE_LACKS_*_PROTOTYPE. The use of
          the ACE_LACKS_*_PROTOTYPE was removed from ACE code in
          Thu Jan 20 11:42:53 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>
          plus, it's wrong. The functions (at least on HP-UX, which seems
          to center on the issue here) are available when needed via a
          #pragma extern, which effectively inlines the code from the
          compiler. Adding a prototype is the wrong thing to do in this
          case.

        * m4/compiler.m4: Add -ext to aCC's options. Turns on long-long.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Remove all the specific
          macro setting to try and select particular threading features and
          Rogue Wave libs. Use -mt and be done with it. -mt does the right
          thing wrt RW and preprocessor feature macros based on the -AA/-AP
          options. Also add -ext to turn on long-long.

Fri Jan 21 00:15:19 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acemfcexe.mpb: New base project
          that sets the proper subsystem and macros for an MFC app.

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.ico:
        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.rc:
        * tests/ACE_Init_Test_Resource.h: Modernized resource defs to let
          ACE_Init_Test build and run properly.

        * tests/tests.mpc: Added the rest of the needed files for ACE_Init_Test
          and made it require mfc; base it off acemfcexe (new, above).

Mon Jan 17 20:47:01 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.cpp (handle_accept): If the new handler has
          already set its own proactor pointer, don't reset it. Fixes
          Bugzilla #3947.

Wed Jan  5 23:10:05 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Bug_2610_Regression_Test.cpp: Fixed a bunch of ACE_ERROR
          statements to log the actual error cause; also fixed for IPv6.

Wed Jan  5 21:47:19 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Bug_2609_Regression_Test.cpp: Carried over improvements to this
          tests, particularly for IPv6, from 5.8 tree.

Sun Nov  7 00:13:13 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.cpp: Mismatching the addr->name test is not
          necessarily an error.

Fri Nov  5 14:23:26 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Added a hook for users to
          include site-private rules in a build. If the user places a
          "rules.private.GNU" in any build directory it will get included
          from rules.local.GNU. The "private_rules_file" make variable
          can be set to override the name and/or location of the file.
          If no such rules file exists, its absence is silently ignored.
          This facility can be used, for example, to integrate a specialized
          code checker into the build process.

Thu Nov  4 15:17:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): For platforms that have the GNU-extended
          gethostbyname2_r() function, use it instead of getaddrinfo() for
          a IPv6 hostname lookup. Customer reports that it getaddrinfo() is
          hugely slower than gethostbyname2 on large vlans. The alternate
          code is used if ACE_HAS_GETHOSTBYNAME2 is set in config.h.

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.cpp: Add some IPv6 address and name lookups.

Tue Nov  2 01:25:05 UTC 2010  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (ACE_Log_Msg::log): Added

          ACE_OS::memset(format,'\0',128);

          to ensure the format string has known values.  Thanks to Chad
          Beaulac <chad dot beaulac at objectivesolutions dot com> for
          this suggestion.  This fixes bugid 3923.

Thu Oct 28 17:45:10 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): Corrected ACE_HAS_IPV6 checks made in
          Wed Oct 27 22:16:12 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>.

Wed Oct 27 22:16:12 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): When looking up a hostname, always use
          gethostbyname() for IPv4 requests, even if IPv6 is available.
          getaddrinfo() (used when IPv4 and 6 are both available) is hugely
          slower than gethostbyname() in large vlan environments. Note that
          even though gethostbyname() can grok IPv6 on Linux, it can't
          anywhere else, so I avoided trying to go that route.

Wed Oct 20 16:07:09 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp (ACE_Thread_Timer_Queue_Adapter::svc):
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp (expire):
          Temporarily release and reacquire the mutex around timer dispatch.
          This prevents a deadlock on user code with multiple threads doing
          timer-related operations.

Thu Sep 02 11:18:34 EDT 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* ACE version 5.7b released.

Thu Sep  2 14:59:27 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (handle_ready):
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp:
        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Test.cpp: Reverted the changes from
          Wed Sep  1 19:31:24 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          They caused other problems with existing usage. The referenced
          TAO test behind the problems needs to be fixed, not ACE.

Wed Sep  1 19:31:24 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (handle_ready): Changed the timeout behavior to just
          return 0, no errno, as ACE_OS::poll() and ACE_OS::select() both do.
          This restores historic behavior changed inadvertently at
          Fri Aug 27 19:17:11 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp:
        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Test.cpp: Re-added the if/switch on return value from
          ACE::handle_read|write_ready() to detect timeout and set errno
          here.

          These changes were necessary to fix the TAO faults test. Thanks
          to Johnny and Simon for narrowing down the cause and testing
          the fix.

Mon Aug 30 16:48:34 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/FIFO.h:
        * ace/FIFO_Recv.h:
        * ace/FIFO_Send.h: Clarified initialization and open behavior.

Fri Aug 27 19:17:11 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (handle_ready, handle_timed_complete,
                       handle_timed_accept): On platforms where poll() is
          available, prefer that to using select() for checking a single
          handle's state and/or waiting for a condition. This preference
          was previously only used if ACE_HAS_LIMITED_SELECT was set. The
          ACE_HAS_LIMITED_SELECT choice is removed, making ACE_HAS_POLL the
          setting that switches this preference. The driving reason for this
          is that if select() is called to detect changes on a handle whose
          values falls outside that which can safely be stored in an fdset,
          the handle-setting macros/functions will set/clear bits outside
          of the fdset. This results in very weird memory changes, often in
          the stack, which are very hard to diagnose. poll()'s operation
          does not suffer from this affect. With the growing use of large
          numbers of handles and use of ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor on Linux,
          the rate at which this problem was cropping up was increasing.
          Thanks to Olivier Langlois for diagnosing this problem and
          proposing the patch.
        
          (handle_ready): Properly set the poll condition for read and/or
          write. Thanks to kumaran.prem@gmail.com for this fix.

        * ace/Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Test.cpp: Replaced use of ACE_OS::select() with
          ACE::handle_ready() and friends.

        This all resolves Bugzilla #3606.

Fri Aug 27 15:01:41 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Connector.{h cpp} (ACE_NonBlocking_Connect_Handler): Add a
          handle_close() which calls handle_input() if called by the
          ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor to remove a failed connect. Apparently,
          Linux epoll, at least sometimes, signals EPOLLERR on a failed
          nonblocking connect, unlike the select() case which selects the
          failed fd for read. Thanks to Kannan Ramaswamy <kannan dot
          ramaswamy at cogcap dot com> for this information and fix.

Wed Aug 25 19:58:19 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h cpp}: Regarding change number 2 at
          Fri Mar 26 14:07:55 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          dispatching notifies in only one thread at a time was 1) wrong
          (TP_Reactor doesn't do this), 2) broke important existing
          applications at a customer site. This has been fixed so that the
          notify dispatch behavior is like ACE_TP_Reactor: when the
          notify handle is signaled, extract one notification, release
          the token, dispatch the notification. Thus, each thread will
          dispatch one notification, and multiple threads can dispatch
          them at the same time if there are multiples.

          Also fixed an error where it was possible to lose notice of a
          notification. Resolves Bugzilla #3328.

Thu Jul 15 17:53:47 UTC 2010  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
        * THANKS:
        
          Restore pre-gestalt behavior of returning -1 if svc.conf does
          not exist and an ACE_Service_Config::open() is expecting to use
          the default file.

          Thanks to Daynesh Mangal (daynesh@gmail.com) for reporting the
          errant behavior.
        
Thu Jun 24 02:07:18 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.inl (open): Allow the command line options to
          override the passed ignore_static_svcs argument. Restores correct
          operation, fixing Bugzilla #3865.

Fri Jun 18 19:58:55 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp: Add _get_dll_unload_policy() function that
          returns ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY_LAZY; this prevents the DLL_Manager
          from running down ACE framework components just from unloading
          a service contained in ACE itself.
          Fix for Bugzilla #3856.

Wed May 19 11:29:14 UTC 2010  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.inl:
          This fixes bug 3848. Now ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor::Handler_Repository
          will maintain its max and current size.
          ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor::size() will return number of handlers
          registered in the reactor. Also this commit fixes code formatting
          and simplifies conditionally compiled code.

Tue May  4 21:23:44 UTC 2010  Chad Beaulac <chad@objectivesolutions.com>

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:
          One of problems is that ACE_Module_Type::name gets its
          value from the svc.conf file. The ACE_Module that it references
          gets its name from the static factory method used to create the
          module. When the names don't match the call to ACE_Stream_Type::fini
          fails to remove any ACE_Modules from the underlying ACE_Stream.
          Since none of the ACE_Modules are removed, ACE_Module_Type::fini
          tries to call fini on the ACE_Module reader and writer ACE_Task
          instances. And they've already been deleted by ACE_Stream::close
          called from ACE_Stream_Type::fini.

          Reassigned ACE_Module::name in ACE_Module_Type::init to
          ACE_Module_Type::name and fixed the SEGV at shutdown because of the
          issue described above.

          All of these issues are related: #3334 #3205 #2916 #3847

Fri Apr 23 09:38:35 EDT 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* ACE version 5.7a released.

Tue Apr 20 18:46:38 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Service_Config_Stream_Test.{cp conf}: Brought this test over
          from hte dev stream as well as Bug_3334_Regression_Test.cpp.

Mon Apr 19 18:17:30 UTC 2010 UTC 2010 Chad Beaulac <chad@objectivesolutions.com>

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp
          Modified ASR::fini to print debug info for empty
          service entries and handle empty service entries.
          This fixes the ASR remove functionality that was
          one of the reasons SC_Server was crashing at shutdown.

        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/SC_Server.cpp
          Removing signal handler before main exit to present SEGV

        This fixes Bugzilla #2916 and #3205.

Mon Apr 19 12:44:56 UTC 2010 Chad Beaulac <chad@objectivesolutions.com>

        * ace/Service_Types.h
        * ace/Service_Types.inl
        * ace/Service_Types.cpp
          Added service_type_ attr to expose the type of service being
          managed to the ACE_Service_Repository. This allows the ASR to
          manage the lifecycle of the ACE_Module and ACE_Stream in order to
          avoid a double delete of ACE_Module at shutdown.

          ACE_Stream_Type::fini was modified to not call ACE_Module_Type::fini
          as this will results in a double delete when
          ACE_Service_Repository::fini is called.
          ACE_Stream_Type::remove(module_name) was modified to not call
          ACE_Module_Type::fini as this will results in a double delete
          when ACE_Service_Repository::fini is called also.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp
          Modified ASR::fini to iterate over the service_array_ twice.
          ACE_Service_Type::fini is called on all ACE_Stream_Type and
          ACE_Service_Object_Type instances first. Then, fini is called on
          all ACE_Modules_Type instances. All calls to fini are done in the
          order the services appear in the ASR::service_array_ except for
          the grouping described here. The calls to ACE_Module_Type::fini
          must be done last because ACE_Stream_Type::fini accesses the Modules
          so they must not be deleted by a call to ACE_Module_Type::fini
          before that.

        * tests/Bug_3334_Regresssion_Test.cpp
          Added call to ACE_Service_Repository::fini_svcs() to capture all
          debug output before the application exits.

        * tests/run_tests.lst
          Removed !FIXED_BUGS_ONLY from Bug_3334_Regression_Test

        This fixes Bugzilla #3334

Tue Apr 13 19:34:40 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h cpp}: Reorder the enqueue/pipe operations
          when adding a notification to close the race where notifies can get
          lost in the ACE_HAS_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE case. Also fixed a misplaced
          #endif in read_notification_pipe() and cleaned it up some.

        Pulled these fixes from the dev stream:

        Fri Mar 26 14:07:55 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h inl cpp}: Refinements to the way notifies
          are handled:
            1. The notify handler was being dispatched multiple times per
               notify; this has been fixed, which increases performance.
            2. Notifications are now dispatched in only one thread at a time.
               This brings more parity to the way notifies are handled in
               other reactor implementations.

        * tests/MT_NonBlocking_Connect_Test.cpp:
          And another attempt to workaround WFMO reactor. The previous

        * tests/MT_NonBlocking_Connect_Test.cpp:
          Fixed a test on Windows for WFMO reactor which doesn't support
          work_pending() function.

        Wed Mar 17 11:58:10 UTC 2010  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        Committed the changes that I had to revert before x.7.7.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
          Changed the code so that close() is called in case of failure
          instead of destroy().

        * ace/Connector.cpp:
        * ace/Connector.h:
          Changed the fix for bug#3731. Now NBCH adds a reference in
          constructor and removes it in destructor if the SVC_HANDLER that
          it owns is reference counted. This is a cleaner solution than the
          one used before.

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.h:
        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.cpp:
        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp:
          Extended NonBlocking_Conn_Test and changed Process_Strategy_Test
          because of the change in Strategies_T.cpp.

        * tests/MT_NonBlocking_Connect_Test.cpp:
        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Added a new test. This can be a reproducer for the bug#3731 which
          currently doesn't have its own test.


        Wed Mar 10 10:31:16 UTC 2010  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Fixed bug#2609 and enabled the test for it. Thanks to Milan
          Cvetkovic <milan dot cvetkovic at mpathix dot com> for
          contributing this.

Fri Mar 19 16:44:37 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (find_handler): If the handle isn't
          registered, don't try to dereference a null pointer; return 0.

Wed Mar 17 20:00:45 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_common.GNU: Make the ARFLAGS
          setting overridable.

Tue Nov 10 06:31:33  2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp (enqueue_*): When enqueuing blocks, grab the
          notifier pointer before releasing the guard; check it and do any
          needed notify() outside the lock scope. Avoids dereferencing 'this'
          when the message queue is deleted between the time the guard is
          released and the notify is checked. User is still responsible for
          ensuring the lifetime of a notifier the user supplies.
          Also, moved the monitor updates out of notify() and into the
          enqueue_* methods, inside the guard scope since they refer to
          object state; rely on the Monitor docs that say the updates are
          well-behaved.

Tue Mar  2 21:02:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (mask_ops_i): If the specified handle is
          not registered, return -1 instead of crashing.

Fri Feb 12 14:05:21 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp: Fix unused variable warning.

Thu Feb  4 15:32:24 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h: Two performance improvements to resolve
          Bugzilla #3714:
            1. The notify handler is no longer suspended/resumed around
               notify processing. This removes the biggest source of CPU
               consumption introduced at ACE 5.7 - simply acquiring/releasing
               the token to handle notifies, each of which triggered another
               token acquire/notify cycle.
            2. As I/O handlers are suspended before callback, they are not
               immediately resumed on callback return. Instead, they are added
               to a "to be resumed" list that is examined just prior to the
               next epoll_wait() call; any to-be-resumed handles are added
               back to the epoll set just before waiting. This removes another
               need to acquire the token just to resume a handler.

Tue Jan 26 17:02:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (unbind_all): When shutting down, call
          handle_close() on all registered handlers. Fixes Bugzilla 2750.

Thu Dec 31 20:54:51 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (get_cpuinfo): Don't use a CPU MHz value 0.
          I got a customer report with a real cpuinfo file showing 0.

Thu Dec 31 17:46:10 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_fl.mpb: Rather than add
          PLATFORM_GL_LDFLAGS twice, one should be PLATFORM_X11_LDFLAGS.
          Thanks to Aaron Scamehorn for catching this.

Thu Dec 31 17:24:14 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: If both static_libs_only
          and shared_libs_only are set, report the error and stop. Thanks to
          Howard Finer for reporting this.

Mon Dec  7 16:09:18 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Basic_Types_Test.cpp: Add a verification for the endianness
          setting.

Wed Nov  4 00:07:49 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (resume_handler_i): If asked to resume a
          handler without any bits currently set, just note the handler has
          been resumed, don't fail it. Prevents orphaned handle if a
          auto-suspended handler's callback clears the lone bit set.

Tue Oct 20 16:20:33 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp (enqueue_*): Move the notify() call outside
          the lock scope; holding the lock across a call that may block (or
          do anything else we don't know about) is dangerous. It resulted in
          deadlock at a customer site.

          See Bugzilla #3250 for any follow-up issues.

        * ace/Process_Mutex.h: Fix doxygen stuff and clarify the behavior
          when based on semaphores vs. mutexes where there's a choice.

Tue Sep  8 20:27:14 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Strip CLEANUP_INSTALL before
          checking for blank to be sure it doesn't inadvertantly try to RM
          a string of spaces.

Sat Aug 29 22:41:33 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Event_Handler.h: Edited doc for resume_handler() to note that
          it also works with ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor.

Thu Aug 27 20:27:52 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd: When building requirement-
          checking and LDFLAGS for building binaries, take ARCH builds into
          account to properly locate libs.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Don't do the ARCH adjusting
          until after including platform_macros.GNU where ARCH would be
          defined.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU: Fix building, installing, and
          cleaning up libs built in an ARCH build.

Tue Aug 18 19:09:40 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-macros.h: In ACE_NOTREACHED, aC++ 03.* needs to have the
          unreachable line removed as well.

Wed Aug  5 23:28:43 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp: When applying the modules in a dynamic
          stream, note that they were link()ed in reverse order from what
          the order is from the svc.conf file. So reverse the order when
          pushing them on the stream. Fixes Bugzilla #3721.

Tue Aug  4 14:32:24 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Configuration.h:
        * ace/Configuration.cpp (ACE_Configuration_Heap::open): Make multiple
          open() calls an error (return -1, EBUSY) rather than leaking
          an allocator and whatever it had allocated.
          Fixes Bugzilla 1324.

        * tests/Config_Test.cpp: Add test case for multiple open() calls.

        * NEWS: Noted the behavior change on open().

Tue Jul 28 18:13:22 UTC 2009  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_Memory.h: Replace the ACE_throw_bad_alloc macro
          definition with return (void*) 0 if exceptions=0 is enabled.
          Thanks to John Lindal <lindalj at yahoo-inc dot com> for this
          fix.

Thu Jul 23 16:40:55 UTC 2009  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp: Added some additional error checking to
          ACE_OS::strerror() to avoid problems when errnum is out of
          bounds.  Thanks to Aleksandar Vukajlovic <aleksandar dot
          vukajlovic at finsoft dot rs> for reporting this.

Fri Jul 17 18:32:45 UTC 2009  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.cpp (mktime): Set t_sys.wMilliseconds to 0 so
          it's initialized properly.  Thanks to Ryan Carmichael
          <RCarmichael at drs-tem dot com> for this fix.

Mon Jul  6 20:33:00 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:

          Fixed a bug where the number of bytes passed to ACE_OS::malloc is
          incorrect for ACE_USES_WCHAR (each character can be > 1 byte).

Mon Jun 22 09:33:40 CDT 2009  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

	* ACE version 5.7 released.

Tue Jun 16 15:14:52 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_main.cpp:

          For Windows CE/Mobile: when constructing argv[0], quote the full
          path to the exe if it contains spaces (\Program Files\...).

Mon Jun 15 07:45:04 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bug_3673_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Added a new test for bugzilla 3673, this test whether exception handling
          works correctly. This doesn't work with CB2007 which is really a compiler
          bug. This test makes it easier to see if other compilers have the same
          bug

Fri Jun 12 19:05:43 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl:

          Windows Mobile 6 can return WSAENOPROTOOPT instead of WSAEOPNOTSUPP
          for setsockopt with an unsupported option.

Fri Jun 12 19:16:04 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Revert the change below, Adam has a better fix
        * ace/config-WinCE.h
          Set ACE_LACKS_SO_RCVBUF for WinCE 5, it is not supported

Fri Jun 12 18:37:04 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-WinCE.h
          Set ACE_LACKS_SO_RCVBUF for WinCE 5, it is not supported

Fri Jun 12 14:12:04 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Removed !FIXED_BUGS_ONLY from Process_Test. Not
          sure why it's there and I never see Process_Test fail.

Fri Jun 12 11:24:09 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp: Added missing ifdef ACE_HAS_EVENT_POLL.

        * tests/run_test.lst: Removed !FIXED_BUGS_ONLY from those fixed:
          Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test_Dev_Poll
          Reactor_Remove_Resume_Test_Dev_Poll
          Refcounted_Event_Handler_Test_DevPoll

Fri Jun 12 00:45:09 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h cpp inl}: Fixed multi-thread behavior of
          ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor to resolve Bugzilla 2740, 3178, 3188, 3279.
          Note that fixing 3178 involved adding the manual-resume behavior from
          ACE_TP_Reactor which was easy after the other fixes. Essentially
          what was done is:
             - Change epoll_wait() from returning all ready events to just one.
             - Registered events now include the EPOLLONESHOT flag, so once
               an event is delivered for a handle, no more will be until
               epoll_ctl() is called again to reset the events.
          This has the effect of suspending handlers around I/O upcalls and
          preventing registration changes from happening while another thread
          is waiting for events.

        * tests/Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test_Dev_Poll.cpp:
        * tests/Refcounted_Event_Handler_Test_DevPoll.cpp:
          When registering the test handle for events, register for read and
          write, not everything. Registering for everything leaves 'connect'
          set when 'write' is removed, but they both map to the same event
          on non-Windows reactors.
          For the _Dev_Poll test, remove the BSD, VxWorks, Lynx-only case for
          removing write-mask - this should always be done.

        * tests/MT_Reactor_Upcall_Test.cpp: When setting up the
          ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor, set the restart flag.

        * tests/Bug_2740_Regression_Test.cpp: Tweaks for more informative
          logging and remove false-fails on peer socket closes.

        * tests/run_test.lst: Removed !FIXED_BUGS_ONLY from
          Bug_2740_Regression_Test.

Thu Jun 11 19:27:33 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

          Added additional PRF question about build method (commit performed
          on behalf of Chris Cleeland).

Thu Jun 11 13:25:09 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Only define the custom export macros when they are not defined yet

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
          owner_ is a bool

Thu Jun 11 13:15:09 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.3.GNU:
          Use $(HOST_EXE_EXT) when host_root is set

        * include/makeinclude/platform_cegcc.GNU:
          Set qos to 1 and updated header

Wed Jun 10 18:18:09 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-9.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:
          Fix for Windows CE with msvc9

Wed Jun 10 14:07:09 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.3.GNU:

          Minor adjustment to the part of the change below concerning
          "Allow in-place (no HOST_ROOT) cross-compilation on Win32 hosts."
          If the host tool variables (like $(TAO_IDL)) are already end in .exe
          don't add .exe again.

Mon Jun  8 18:39:58 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Message_Queue_Vx.h:
        * ace/OS_main.h:

          Added ACE_Export to ACE_Message_Queue_Vx.
          Added "exports" for the symbols ace_os_main_i and ace_main_i.
          This allows them to work with GCC 4.x hidden visibility on platforms
          that use redefinition of main (VxWorks).

        * contrib/minizip/minizip.mwc:

          Added a workspace so minizip will be "found" when running
          mwc.pl -recurse.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.3.GNU:

          Both VxWorks and LynxOS:
          For shared library builds (RTP), use -rpath-link to silence
          warnings from the linker.  We assume the libraries in $ACE_ROOT/lib
          will be present at runtime.

          VxWorks only:
          Allow in-place (no HOST_ROOT) cross-compilation on Win32 hosts.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:

          Default "distrib" to 1, which means we will not set RPATH, similar to
          other platforms.  This resolves bug #3678.

        * tests/Network_Adapters_Test.h:
        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Signal_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Fix ACE tests that were failing in single-threaded builds.

Mon Jun  8 09:51:05  2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bug_1890_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Bug_2540_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Put the reactors on the heap to get these tests running
          with Windows CE where we only get a 64Kb main thread

Sun Jun  7 17:53:05  2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Tokenizer_T.h
        * ace/SString.cpp
        * ace/SString.h
          Moved ACE_Tokenizer to its own file and reworked it to
          the C++ template ACE_Tokenizer_T. ACE_Tokenizer is then a
          typedef of ACE_Tokenizer_T<ACE_TCHAR>. This makes it
          possible to use a char tokenizer in a wchar build

        * ace/ace.mpc:

Thu Jun  4 08:56:05  2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (isatty):
          Check the return value of _open_osfhandle, if it returns -1,
          it failed and then calling _isatty with -1 will cause an
          assert of the msvc9 runtime

Mon Jun  1 08:09:05  2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp:
          Fixed gcc4.4 warning in a different way, broke other builds

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Changed version checks to not have to patch again for a next

          Fixed bug 3681, code would not build with glibc-2.10 because the

        * ace/Configuration.{h,cpp}
          With WinCE RegKeyDelete just does a recursive delete, on regular

        * apps/gperf/src/Key_List.cpp:

          Fixed an incorrect check which resulted in valgrind warning.

Tue May 12 08:31:05  2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_errno.h:
          Added ACE_ERRNO_GET, this has to be used when errno is passed to a
          C variable length argument . With WinCE errno is a class instance
          which we can't pass through a variable length argument, the cegcc
          compiler gives a warning about this, it results to an abort at
          runtime. ACE_ERRNO_GET will return the errno as int with WinCE

          error back to the caller and not hide it.

Sat May  2 03:21:01 UTC 2009  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Moved the definition of LIB_PREFIX from rules.lib.GNU to
          wrapper_macros.GNU.
          Now that the checks for library dependencies (i.e. the LIB_CHECK
          variable) depends on LIB_PREFIX, this latter variable needs to
          be defined in all Makefiles.
          However, Makefiles for binaries do not include rules.lib.GNU.
          I am pretty sure they call include wrapper_macros, thus my
          choice for the new location.

          to compile on CE gcc.

        * ace/Process.cpp:
          Removed CE gcc compiler warning by
          using ACE_UNUSED_ARG.

        * ace/Registry.cpp:
        * ace/Registry.h:

        * ace/config-vxworks6.6.h:
        * NEWS:
          Enabled the vxAtomicLib by default for VxWorks 6.6 and newer.
          If you don't want to use this library, undef ACE_HAS_VXATOMICLIB
          in your config.h file

Mon Apr 20 08:45:32 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Another fix for HPUX

        * ace/UUID.h:
        * ace/UUID.inl:
        * ace/UUID.cpp:
        * tests/UUID_Test.cpp:

          Redesigned the internal structure of the UUID so that its key
          data members are a contiguous chunk of memory.

          Implemented a hash () method for the UUID. This will enable it
          to be used in ACE_Hash_Map_Manager objects.

          Remvoed the default constructor (), copy constructor () and
          assignmetnt operator from the UUID_Node object since the UUID
          performs such operations.

Fri Apr 17 15:06:32 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * debianbuild/patches/19-gcc43.dpatch:
          Removed, not needed anymore

Fri Apr 17 15:03:32 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.{h,inl}:
          Added support for VxWorks vxAtomicLib. If you want to use
          that library add ACE_HAS_VXATOMICLIB to your config.h file

        * ace/config-vxworks6.4.h:

          implementation of get_ip_interfaces we have to use

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao-orbsvcs-daemon.patch:
          This patch doesn't work anymore with svn head, if this
          is a real issue, it has to be addressed in the real code
          and not with a patch. This should already be possible with
          the -ORBDeamon flag

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao-ciao.spec:
          Don't apply ace-tao-orbsvcs-daemon.patch, fixed a small

Mon Apr 13 12:19:18 UTC 2009  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          Reverted previous change.

Sun Apr 12 20:37:11 UTC 2009  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          The Rawhide nightly build shows that the scandir and alphasort
          functions have been redefined to finally take dirrent args. The
          detectable difference appears to be in the glibc version code,
          which is 2.9 on the Rawhide build machine.

Sat Apr 11 13:13:49 UTC 2009  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-macosx-leopard.h:

          Fix typo from previous commit.

Fri Apr 10 03:00:44 UTC 2009  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:
        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-common.h:

          The newly added [un]setenv wrappers don't compile on qnx rtp
          because that platform defines unsetenv as having a void
          return. It is possible that other platforms have this as well,
          as legacy linux man pages show that signature.

Thu Apr  9 12:34:41 UTC 2009  Marcel Smit  <msmit@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:

          Introduced ACE_HAS_CEGCC. When defined,
          config-win32-cegcc is included.

        * ace/Numeric_Limits.h:
          "#ifdef" replace by "#if defined"

Mon Apr  6 21:59:51 UTC 2009  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU: Don't acc CFLAGS to
          CCFLAGS; set options that make sense to C and C++ in the
          respective CFLAGS/CCFLAGS. Not all options are cross-compatible
          so they shouldn't be blindly included. Has the side-affect of
          removing the double -pipe (and other options included twice)
          and fixes Bugzilla #3232.

Mon Apr  6 15:17:23 UTC 2009  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp: Added a new close_test() function

          Linux configured with "clock=pit" on the boot line (commonly used
          for virtual machines) can report a 0 MHz CPU, in which case ACE
          must run calibration for the High Res Timer to avoid a division by 0.

Wed Mar 25 19:27:45 UTC 2009  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Address the possibility that both PTHREADS and STHREADS are
          available, which is the case on Solaris 5.5 and newer. The
          header prefers PTHREAD definitions to STHREAD, so now this code
          does the same.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Windows Vista/Server 2008 and newer do have native support for
          condition variables. Added a compilation time flag
          ACE_HAS_WTHREADS_CONDITION_VARIABLE, when this is defined ACE will
          use the native Windows condition api's. Did some unrelated const,
          performance, and code improvements.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp (checkUnicodeFormat):

Tue Mar 24 11:38:22 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp (checkUnicodeFormat):
          Fixed a bug that the file pointer wasn't set to the start of the
          file when the file is just 1 byte large. This fixes bugzilla
          3532, thanks to Martin Gaus <gaus at gmx dot de> for reporting
          this.

Mon Mar 23 23:11:49 UTC 2009  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Sig_Handler.cpp: Fixed a silly bug in the use of
          ACE_Fixed_Set_Iterator that was causing every other signal in
          ACE_Sig_Handlers to be skipped.  Thanks to Andreas Drescher <ace
          at anticat dot ch> for reporting this bug.

Sun Mar 22 19:21:06 UTC 2009  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp:
          Added define ACE_HAS_WIN32_PRIORITY_CLASS. On win32
          platforms where process priority classes exists,
          one can use this define.

Fri Feb 20 09:28:33 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg_IPC.h:

          (ace/svc_export.h is back again).

        * tests/Based_Pointer_Test_Lib_Export.h:

Fri Feb 20 07:29:18 UTC 2009  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.h:
          Added new ACE_HAS_STREAM_LOG_MSG_IPC which controls whether the
          ACE Log_Msg IPC should use streams or not. When ACE_HAS_STREAM_PIPES
          is defined we default to 1, else to 0. We do see that using stream
          pipes causes problems on at least Solaris, so the user can decide
          to set this value explicitly to 0

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h:
          Disable warning 4250, and 4355, we do this for the other
          msvc versions but not for vc8

          compiling with GCC 2.x.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Do not define ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS. It is now handled by
          config-g++-common.h.

Wed Feb 18 09:22:29 UTC 2009  Marcel Smit  <msmit@remedy.nl>

        * tests/DLL_Test.h:
          Revert changes made by Johnny (just use
          ace/svc_export.h again).

        * tests/DLL_Test_Export.h:
          Removed since ace/svc_export.h is
          used again.

Tue Feb 17 23:56:45 UTC 2009  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          passed to ACE_DEBUG/ACE_ERROR is converted automatically to
          unicode in an unicode build. The %p expects an unicode string,
          if a plain ascii string is passed in, this is just handled as
          unicode string and could lead to a crash because then we are
          just reading random memory
