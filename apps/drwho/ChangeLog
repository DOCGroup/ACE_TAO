Wed Sep 30 13:00:52 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Fixed a bunch of warnings related to char * and const char *.
  	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <doros@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting
 	  this.

Sat Sep 12 21:21:01 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Made zillions of changes to "ACE"ify all of the code.  Drwho is
	  now officially working again!

Sun Sep  6 22:48:52 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Replaced all Str::*() methods with the new ACE::*() methods,
 	  which are more "standard".

	* Began to work on drwho after a 5 year absence...

Sun Feb 14 16:13:10 1993  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net1.ics.uci.edu)

	* Yow. Once again back at work...  This time I fixed things up so
 	  that the release compiles properly with Solaris 2.1 C++, g++
 	  2.3.3, and the Sun C++ compiler on Sun OS 4.1.x.  To do this I
 	  had to change the user-defined memory allocator somewhat, since
 	  the Sun C++ compiler was using the global NEW operator to
 	  allocate pools of memory behind my back...  Naturally, this
 	  reaked havoc with the existing version in the server, which
 	  returns all the allocated memory to the free list once a request
 	  is satisfied.  In addition, g++ had a weird multiple
 	  inheritance/pure virtual function bug that I fixed by reordering
 	  certain pure virtual functions.  Oh what fun... ;-) Anyhow,
 	  everything is now back in running order!

Sun Dec  6 16:13:21 1992  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net1.ics.uci.edu)

	* Yow, well, after about 8 months of total neglect I'm finally
 	  back at work on this program!  The current changes I did today
 	  involved getting drwho to compile with g++ 2.3.2.  This required
 	  a couple of small work arounds in the source code due to bugs,
 	  but hey, I guess it is better than nothing right?!
	  
	  Also, I had to fix a couple of places where I didn't correctly
 	  initialize static variables (the compiler implementations have
 	  changed since last year obviously).  Also, I've changed a couple
 	  of the default server hosts to reflect the fascist policies of
 	  our support group ;-) (I've no longer got access to certain
 	  servers...)

	  Anyhow, I think drwho is once again running with g++, so now I
 	  can hand the release over to Ericka... ;-)

Wed May  6 23:12:02 1992  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

	* There is something horribly wrong with g++ 2.1.  Therefore, I
 	  had to make a couple of changes in the pmc-rusers.C and
 	  pm-client.C files in order to make the blasted thing compile
 	  when I had pointers to member functions...  Make sure to change
 	  this back when g++ is fixed...

Tue Feb  4 11:23:12 1992  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net6.ics.uci.edu)

	* The blasted program was crashing when there were consecutive
 	  newlines in the input file.  I fixed
 	  File_Manager::get_login_and_real_name and
 	  File_Manager::open_friends_file so that they detect and skip
 	  over these consecutive newlines.

Thu Nov 21 21:55:00 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net6.ics.uci.edu)

	* Make the time that drwho uses to consider a host idle be a
 	  command-line parameter.

Wed Nov 13 14:24:40 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at bastille.ics.uci.edu)

	* Something else that ought to be done:

	  Add a flag to the -R option that allows the hostname to be
 	  printed using the internet address and/or the hostname...

Sat Nov  9 13:45:30 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at bastille.ics.uci.edu)

	* Added zillions more changes yet again.  We now have an rusers
 	  compatibility mode (-R), to go along with the -a, -w, and
 	  default (flo) options.

	* Changed the -w option so that it only returns the name of the
 	  host machine where the user is logged in.  This way, I can say:
	  
	  % talk schmidt@`drwho -w schmidt`
	  % rsh `drwho -w schmidt` w

	  etc... ;-)

	* Added support for the -L option (print using login name rather
 	  than real name).  Also added support for the -l option (print
 	  out verbosely, a la ls -l!).

Sun Oct 27 21:32:15 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at bastille.ics.uci.edu)

	* Need to complete the -s and -S options to support sorting the
 	  output by login name and real name, respectively...  In order to
 	  support the '*' indication with this scheme we probably need to
 	  lists, one for active and one for inactive users!

Tue Oct 22 00:13:21 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net6.ics.uci.edu)

        * Make another zillion changes...

Sun Oct 20 21:35:24 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net6.ics.uci.edu)

	* Added support for the -p option to allow setting the client and
 	  server port number from the command-line.

	* Things done so far:

	  * Owen also wants an new rflo feature (done)

	    I also want a version that given a command like:

	      whereis omalley

	    would return the login where that login is active if there is
	    one (ie. omalley@zola). Then you could have commands like: 

	      talk `whereis omalley`

	    that would find where I am and try to talk to me there.

	  * Another neat addition would be: have an option (e.g., `-a') so
 	    that rflo would return *all* the users logged in and then look
 	    up their names using the yp passwd stuff! (partially done, but
 	    not very elegantly yet...). (done)

	  * Make the port number a command-line option... (done)

	  * we also need think about how to incorporate inheritance and
 	    dynamic binding into this thang (probably it can be used for
 	    the local/remote split, and also perhaps for the
 	    friends/everyone split (see below)). (done)

	  * Fix up the options stuff wrt the -F option etc... (done)

	  * Have I fixed the is_active shit? (done)

	  * we need a "message abstraction" that abstracts away from the
	    details of packets protocols and remote operations protocols.
	    (done).

	  * Note, should make an option so we could read the names of the
	    hosts to query from a file... (done)

Fri Oct 18 16:17:39 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net6.ics.uci.edu)

	* I've made countless changes...  

Wed Oct 16 17:42:40 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net6.ics.uci.edu)

	* Undid the message manager abstraction and merged it in with the
 	  Friend_Manager client and server.  This really cleans up the
 	  interface!

	* Yow, make zillions of important changes to make the
 	  client/server split more explicit...  Now the Friend_Manager is
 	  split into client and server, the message manager is split, and
 	  the communications manager is also split.  Each file is much
 	  smaller and easier to understand!

Mon Oct 14 18:36:55 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net1.ics.uci.edu)

	* Added support for the -h and -? options, that print out a long
	  and short usage message, respectively.

Tue Oct  1 09:28:29 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

	* The -a option works a great deal better too...  I added a check
 	  in the File_Manager::open_passwd_file routine to strip off the
 	  extra subfields in the pw_gecos field, since this info isn't
 	  really very useful and makes the "real name" field too long!

	* Added some extra stuff to the Comm_Manager so that I could
 	  change the max size of the UDP datagrams that are passed around.
  	  As it turns out, I don't really need to do this, but it is more
 	  robust this way...

Thu Sep 26 14:00:45 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

	* Make sun3 and sun4 subdirectories to help the build process!

	* Changed the UDP port number from 12346 to 12344 so I wouldn't
 	  collide with Owen!
	 
	* There is a weird bus error problem on the sun 4s...  Hum...

	* Yow, got everything working again...

	* Still to do:

	  * Think about fixing the -f option to work correctly for
	    *relative* filenames...

	  * Make UDP_BUFFER_SIZE a command-line option...

	  * Modify server.C to be started by inetd.

	  * For -a option... if they are a friend, use the name from 
	    .friend.dta otherwise use the name from the passwd file. 

	  * Don't forget about:

	    delete Friend_Manager::friend_record;
	    delete Friend_Manager::sorted_record;

	    Need to figure out a good way to deal with this!

Mon Sep 23 16:09:46 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

	* Added a neat feature that now allows the user to specify which
	  hosts to examine by specifying an option ('-F') on the
	  command-line that reads the contents of that file and inserts it
	  into the list of files. 

Wed Sep 18 10:46:41 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at bastille.ics.uci.edu)

	* We need to make all the interfaces throughout rflo much more
	  object-oriented, e.g.:
	  
	* Made a host-manager abstraction to handle all the host
	  machine related operations.  This makes the options stuff
	  *much* cleaner!

	* Make rflo compile with g++ 1.37.2!  Now it compiles with cfront
	  2.0, Saber C++ 1.0.1 and g++-1.39.0 and g++-1.37.2.

Tue Sep 17 19:02:47 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

	* Started merging in the stuff Owen did.  I'm trying to maintain a
 	  consistent programming style...  The Owen stuff adds support for
 	  timeouts and fixes problems with returning a count of the number
 	  of friends!

Wed Sep  4 10:14:51 1991  Douglas C. Schmidt  (schmidt at net4.ics.uci.edu)

	* Things to do:
	  
	  * Add comprehensive daemon support for server.C.
	  * Add timeout stuff in case hosts are down!
	  * Talk to support about making a standard daemon.
	  * Fix the problem with returning the number of friends.
