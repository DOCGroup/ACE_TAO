This directory contains an example that illustrates how the ACE
Service Configurator can configure static and dynamic services, both
from the command-line and from a svc.config file.  We define several
instances, i.e., Timer_Service_1 and Timer_Service_2 of the SAME
service just to exercise different configuration options.  A "real"
application would usually define different services.
