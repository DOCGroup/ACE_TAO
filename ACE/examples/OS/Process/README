This directory contains two examples: <imore> and <process>.  They
show how you can play with various features of ACE_Process to create
new processes.

imore:
-----
This example shows how to redirect the output of one process (in our
case, the parent process) to another process (child process.)  This is
very similiar what a UNIX shell does when we "pipe" command together.
You can select whether you want to use named pipes or a unnamed pipe.


process:
--------

This example shows how to use ACE_Process to "portably" create new
processes.  The ACE_Process_Options class allows applications to
portably specify path, command-line arguments, environment variable
values.  It also allows applications to set the new process' standard
handles (stdin, stdout, and stderr).  ACE_Process is created with the
ACE_Process_Options and can be used to perform operations on the
running process.

Notice that this example uses NT version's UNIX utilities like
"DATE.EXE," and "ls.exe."  You can find where to get them from
Microsoft's NT page on the Web.

Run the application as ./process -u to get all the command-line
options.

Here's an example output:

lambada:OS/Process> ./process -a
