This directory contains an example which
tests the setting of the Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP)
values in the
IP TOS field of a stream of UDP packets.

Running the example
===================

(1)  On one host, run:
        server [UDP port number]

     If port number is omitted, a default port number of 20002
     is used.

(2)  On a second host, run:
        diffserv_test [destination host] [destination port]

        The host and port of where the server is running should
        be specified.

     A stream of UDP packets will be sent from to the server,
     with various codepoints set.

(3)  Look at the Diffserv Field (formerly known as the TOS field)
     of your packets, using a protocol analyzer, such as Ethereal.




Introduction
============
In RFC 2474, the Type of Service (TOS) field in
the IP header was renamed the Diffserv (DS) field.
The DS field is one octet (8 bits).

        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |         DSCP          |  ECN  |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

The first 6 bits of the field are
reserved for the Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP).
There are 64 possible values (0-63) for the DSCP.

Bits 6 and 7 of the DS field are reserved
for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
ECN is defined in RFC 3168.


Per-Hop Behaviors (PHB)
=======================

A Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) is a description of the externally
observable forwarding treatment applied at a differentiated
services compliant node.

Certain PHB's are defined in RFC's and associated with
different DSCP values.  Other values are undefined and left
for experimentation.  Please refer to the RFC's for a full
explanation of the attributes of the various PHB's.
