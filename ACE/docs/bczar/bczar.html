      <title>The realm of the build czar</title>
    </head>
    <h2>Build Czar Duties</h2>
    <p>
      The main duties of the Build Czar are summarized as follows
      <li>
        Continuously monitor the builds using the <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/scoreboard">
          Scoreboard </a>
      as one of the primary source of information.
      <li>
      Notify developers who broke compilation to fix the errors as soon as possible,
      ideally by the next day. A red color in the "Compile" column is not at all
      acceptable - the Build Czar needs to ensure that these problems are identified
      and fixed in a timely manner. If possible, the Build Czar should let developers
      know what the source of problems might be. It is quite possible that developers
      who checked in the code or users who provided the patch may not have resources
      to investigate the issues, so the Builds Czar's help is essential to keep
      things moving ahead.
      <li>
      Keep an eye on the tests that are run in every build. Anything abnormal needs
      to be notified to the right developer. The Build Czar should try helping the
      developer by providing stack traces (in case of crashes) or other details like
      printouts with debugging level turned on.
      <li>
        Some tests fail in the daily builds for many reasons like known bugs, transient
        timeouts etc. Make sure that no new test failures show up. This <a href="mailto:jwillemsen@remedy.nl">
          guy</a>
      knows most of the information. Ask him to help you out with known problems.
      Keep the builds ticking. Any red on the "Last Finished" column in the
      Scoreboard should be fixed. The link to the "Build Name" indicates the machine
      where the build is being run.
      <li>
      The builds don't cover all the possible configurations. If you get a bug report
      about a compile error in a particular configuration, try setting up a build to
      make sure that it doesn't show up again if it has been fixed.
      <li>
        Keep an eye on the <a href="http://bugzilla.dre.vanderbilt.edu/">bugzilla
        </a>
      entries that are registered by users and developers. Decide on the bugs that
      need to be fixed for the micro and pain developers for an ETA.
    </p>
    <P>
      The document <a href="./privileges.html">here </a>talks about the powers of a
      build Czar.
    </P>
    <P>
      The Build Czar is empowered to set up more builds on his own for his
      convenience. This <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DOCGroup/autobuild/master/README">
        page </a>has a step by step instructions on how to do that.
    </P>
    <P>
      The build czar can get the build configuration by looking at the config portion
      of the scoreboard.
    </P>
    <p>Pro-active involvement by the build czar is necessary. Being a pro-active
      build czar requires monitoring the git repository carefully and responding
      quickly to suspected changes to keep the repo stays stable.</p>
    <p>After an email from the Coverity scan project check the Coverity project and
       check that there are no new errors reported. If so, contact the person who
       introduced the error.</p>
    <p>Check the daily test statistics email to determine any drop in test failures.
       Do note that when there are a lot of compile errors the test results are really
       unusable.</p>

    <h2>Recipe for Cutting a Minor Kit</h2>
    <P>
      The build czar is also in charge for the release of the micro. Cutting a micro is
      as simple as cutting butter if things go well. Here is the procedure followed
      while cutting a micro:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The whole process takes somewhere between 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>
          We suggest you take advantage of GNU Screen so that even if your SSH session is
          interrupted, the cutting process can continue. This command must be installed on
          the machines we use to cut the release.
          <ul>
            <li>
              type <code>screen</code> to start screen.</li>
            <li>
              execute commands as normal. Note that Ctrl-A is special in screen, so you need
              to type Ctrl-A-A to send a Ctrl-A to the shell</li>
            <li>
              should your session be interrupted, reconnect and type <code>screen -x</code></li>
            <li>
              when finished, just type exit twice</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            After login check that you can,
            <br>
            <code>ssh bczar@download.dre.vanderbilt.edu</code><br>
            to ensure that this succeeds. If not fix the problem, if ok exit again back to
        <li>
          Prior to starting this, gather aggregate release notes from all developers.
          This is usually in the form of an email plea asking to update all NEWS files in
          the archive. These NEWS files are used as part of the release notes for the release.</li>
        <li>
          Make sure your release system has all the needed tools. This can be achieved on Fedora
          using:
          <ul>
            <li><code>yum install perl svn screen pysvn automake doxygen bzip2 tar gzip openssh graphviz zip libtool GitPython</code></li>
            <li><code>yum update</code></li>
          </ul>
          or on OpenSuSE
          <ul>
            <li><code>zypper install perl screen python-pysvn automake doxygen bzip2 tar gzip openssh graphviz zip libtool python-gitpython</code></li>
            <li><code>zypper update</code></li>
          </ul>
          If you want to perform a full build with qt support, than run:
          <ul>
            <li><code>yum install deltarpm ntp rubygem-rmagick bison xerces-c-devel psmisc yum-utils gdb unzip glibc-devel libasan bison redhat-lsb perl-Pod-Usage rubygems clang make patch libcgroup-devel ant setuptool system-config-network-tui system-config-firewall-tui lcov gnuplot java-1.8.0-openjdk git-svn perl svn screen pysvn automake doxygen bzip2 tar gzip openssh graphviz zip libtool gcc-c++ boost-devel valgrind openssl-devel gcc qt4 fltk-devel bzip2-devel rsync openssl lzo-devel zziplib-devel acpid acpi nfs-utils java xerces-c xerces-c-devel mc qt qt-devel icecream ruby ruby-devel lksctp-tools-devel git telnet GitPython NetworkManager wget mailx</code></li>
          </ul>
          For some optional i686 packages run
          <ul>
            <li><code>yum install openssl-devel.i686 xerces-c-devel.i686 glibc-devel.i686 glibc.i686 libstdc++.i686 ncurses-libs.i686 zlib.i686</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Setup your ssh access to github according to the github <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">ssh documentation</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Checkout a new workspace on a Fedora system with the last public release and with
          all patches installed.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The best place to create the workspace is under <code>/export/anduriltmp/bczar</code> (if you are on anduril). Don't
            use the home directory itself, it is an NFS share and not really fast.
          </li>
          <li>
            Checkout like this:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO.git ACE_TAO</code></li>
              <li>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO.git MPC</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Set $DOC_ROOT to point to the new workspace you checked out.</li>
        <li>
          Set an environment variable SIGNATURE indicating your full name. This is used
          to fill the commit entry.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example,<tt>export SIGNATURE="Johnny Willemsen"</tt></li></ul>
        <li>
          Set an environment variable MAILID indicating your mail id. This is used to
          fill the mail id portion of the commit entry.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example,<tt>export MAILID="jwillemsen@remedy.nl"</tt></li></ul>
        <li>
          Change directories to <tt>$DOC_ROOT</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
          Tag the release by executing<br>
          <code>ACE/bin/make_release.py --micro --update --tag --push</code><br>
          This will only take a couple minutes to complete and once done successfully,
          you can carry on with BOTH creating the kits and generating the doxygen
          documentation in parallel. NOTE that <code>--micro</code> should be replaced
          with <code>--minor</code> or <code>--major</code> as appropriate.</li>
        <br>
        After the repository has been tagged check each file listed below to make
        sure version numbers are updated as expected.<br>
        <br>
        In the <em>EXTREMELY</em> unlikely event that something goes wrong during the <em>
          tagging</em> of the repo, the following files must be returned to the state
        they were in before the release process started and then checked back into git:<br>
        <ul>
          <code>
            <li>
              ACE/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM</li>
            <li>
              ACE/VERSION</li>
            <li>
              ACE/TAO/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM</li>
            <li>
              TAO/VERSION</li>
            <li>
              TAO/tao/Version.h</li>
            ace/Version.h</li> </code>
        </ul>
        In most cases, a<br>
        <code>svn revert -R *</code><br>
        from DOC_ROOT will suffice.<br />
    The tag will also need to be removed (both in Middleware and MPC):
    ACE+TAO-X_Y_Z (where X is the ACE Major version number, and Y & Z are the
    Minor and Micro release numbers of the release that is to be restarted).<p>
      E.g.:<br>
      <code>cd ACE_TAO && git tag -d ACE+TAO-X_Y_Z<br />
        cd MPC && git tag -d ACE+TAO-X_Y_Z<br />
      </code>
      <br>
      Note that this <em>only</em> needs to be done if the <em>tagging</em> fails. If
      kit creation fails, simply restart that process.
      <li>
        Create the kits by executing<br>
        <code>ACE/bin/make_release.py --kit</code><br>
        This will take somewhere around 2-4 hours to complete.
        <ul>
          <li>
            These commands only tags and creates the kits for the software itself, not
            documentation, this can be started in parallel with this activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            The kits end up in <tt>$DOC_ROOT/packages</tt></li>
        </ul>
    <p>
    To summarize, the following is a transcript of the steps up to this point
    executing successfully:
    <p><code>$ ssh ..<br>
        No default printer<br>
        screen<br>
        cd $HOME<br>
        rm -rf DOC_ROOT<br>
        mkdir DOC_ROOT<br>
        cd DOC_ROOT<br>
        export DOC_ROOT=$PWD<br>
        git clone https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO.git ACE_TAO<br>
        git clone https://github.com/DOCGroup/MPC.git MPC<br>
        cd ACE_TAO<br>
        ACE/bin/make_release.py --micro --update --verbose<br>
        ACE/bin/make_release.py --micro --tag --verbose<br>
        ACE/bin/make_release.py --micro --push --verbose<br>
        ACE/bin/make_release.py --kit<br>
      </code>
    <p>
      Feel free to cut and paste with suitable edits.
      <li>
        The packages end up by default under $DOC_ROOT/package-&lt;PID&gt;, you can
        copy them to the webserver using the following commands. (Note that &lt;PID&gt;
        needs to be the numerical pid of the process that created the kit, use<br>
        <code>ls -ald</code>
        to determine the correct filename.) At the moment you execute these commands
        all users can download these packages.</li>
      <code>scp $DOC_ROOT/package-&lt;PID&gt;/ACE*
        bczar@download.dre.vanderbilt.edu:/export/www/download.dre/ACE+TAO-distribution<br>
      </code>
      <li>
        After the repository is tagged you can also start generating the doxygen
        documentation in parallel with the kit generation above.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Login to a release system you prepared with the same packages as above:<br>
            <code>screen</code></li>
          <li>
            After login check that you can,
            <br>
            <code>ssh bczar@download.dre.vanderbilt.edu</code><br>
            to ensure that this succeeds. If not fix the problem, if ok exit again back to
            your release system. </li>
          <li>
            <code>cd /tmp</code><br>
            and remove the contents of the doxygen directory and recreate it again with</li><br>
          <code>rm -rf doxygen</code><br>
          <code>mkdir doxygen</code><br>
          <code>cd doxygen</code><br>
          If you create the doxygen documentation on <code>naboo.dre.vanderbilt.edu</code>
          than make sure you use <code>/web/users/isisbuilds/tmp/ACE_wrappers</code>
          as working directory
          <li>
            Update the workspace with the right version tag (replace the X_Y_Z with the ACE
            version number being released e.g. 5_6_7)
            <br>
            <code>git clone https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO.git --depth 1 --branch ACE+TAO-6_4_5 ACE_TAO</code><br>
          </li>
          <li>Change to the ACE_TAO directory using <br>
          cd ACE_TAO</li>
          <li>
            Set the needed environment variables using<br>
            <code>export ACE_ROOT=$PWD/ACE</code><br>
        <code>export TAO_ROOT=$PWD/TAO</code><br>
        <code>export CIAO_ROOT=</code><br>
        <code>export DANCE_ROOT=</code><br>
        <code>export DDS_ROOT=</code><br></li>
          <li>
            Check the doxygen version at the shell by executing the command:<br>
            <code>doxygen --version</code>
            This should be at least 1.6.2
          </li>
          <br>
        Now you are ready to create documentation
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>cd $ACE_ROOT</code><br>
        <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/generate_rel_manpages</code><br>
        When this is ready copy the resulting files using<br>
        <code>scp ACE-html.tar.gz ACE-html.tar.bz2 ACE-html.zip ACE-html.tar.gz.md5 ACE-html.tar.bz2.md5 ACE-html.zip.md5 bczar@download.dre.vanderbilt.edu:/export/www/download.dre/ACE+TAO-distribution</code>

          We now have a bczar Bugzilla user (bczar@dre.vanderbilt.edu) with full
          privileges which points to the bczar user at ISIS. To gain access to this
          account as a new build czar, you could update the ~/.forward file on one of the
          ISIS hosts (for example bczar@naboo.dre.vanderbilt.edu) with your own email
          address (but be aware that if you leave this ~/.forward file in effect, you
          will get innundated with cron mail messages from all of the ISIS lab build
          machines, so it is probably best to remove it after obtaining the Bugzilla
          password). From the "Bugzilla - Main Page"
          (http://bugzilla.dre.vanderbilt.edu/index.cgi) click on one of the various
          "LogIn" links, and from this login page you should be able to "Submit Request"
          to change a forgotten password. If you enter bczar@dre.vanderbilt.edu and click
          "Submit Request" this will email you the password change link to
          bczar@dre.vanderbilt.edu, which will then in turn be forwarded to your own
          email account. Simply copy this link into your browser to set your own bczar
          password for the next steps.</li>
        <li>
          here is the description of how to add a new version through Bugzilla.</li>
        <li>
          go to any Bugzilla "Query" page, you should see a grey box at the bottom. click
          "Log in" link to log in as bczar@dre.vanderbilt.edu.</li>
        <li>
          look at the grey box at bottom again. You will see several links following
          "Edit". Click on the "Product" link.</li>
        <li>
          you are then at "Select product" page. You should see a list components, i.e.,
          ACE TAO. Click on the product you want to edit.</li>
        <li>
          you are then at "Edit product" page. Scroll down a bit, you should see a list
          of all versions coming with this product. At the very beginning of the list,
          you should see "Edit versions" link. Click this link.</li>
        <li>
          you should see a "Add a new version" text box and a "Add" link just above the
          grey box at the bottom. Click on this link</li>
        <li>
          you are then at "Add version of [Name of the product]" page.</li>
        <li>
          you are able to add the new version now.</li>

        <li>
          Move contents of the temporary directory's html to this directory -<br><code>mv ../tmp/html .</code></li>
        <li>
          Now back our of this directory and remove the already existing softlink to the "Micro" directory -<br><code>cd ..<br>rm Micro</code></li>
        <li>
          Create softlink "Micro" linking it to new Documentation using -<br><code>ln -s 6.3.4/html
          Micro</code>. If this is a minor release also update the <code>Stable</code> link.</li>
        <li>
        Remove the directory tmp -<br><code>rm -rf tmp</code></lib>
      </ul><br>
      <li>
        On <b>download.dre.vanderbilt.edu</b> where the kit was uploaded to and once <b>BOTH</b> the kit
        and doxygen generation have finished their work, you should also move the packages to the
        previous versions directory with the appropriate decorators.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>cd /export/www/download.dre/ACE+TAO-distribution</code></li>
          <li>
            Check that the packages in this directory are all from today</li>
          <li>
            Modify <b><code>/export/anduriltmp/bczar/copy_script.sh</code></b>
          to use the correct ACE version X.Y.Z and run it.
          <li>
            Update the copy_script.sh file for the new micro release</li>
        </ul><br>
      <li>
        Validate the packages on the webserver whether they are really containing the new release. Make at least
        one build where you run the TAO Hello world test and check if the libraries are having the
        correct version number.</li>
      <li>
        Update in the autobuild archive the file configs/scoreboard/releases.xml with
        the made release (version number and release date). This is used by the integrated scoreboard on http://scoreboard.remedy.nl.</li>
      <li>
        Update the ACE_wrappers repo:<ul>
        <li>docs/Download.html to show the new release. Make sure you refer to the
        previous_versions directory, that way we can exactly track how many people
        download a specific version.</li>
      <li>
        etc/index.hml to show the new doxygen package you installed</li>
        <li>bin/diff-builds-and-group-fixed-tests-only.sh to give the correct default old_date for this release.</li></ul>
      <li>
        Update the ACE/NEWS and TAO/NEWS files to have a new section for the next release.</li>
      <li>
        Update OpenSuSE Build service using
        <code>
        osc checkout devel:libraries:ACE
        osc add <new release>
        cp rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec .
        cp debian/control debian.control
        cp debian/dsc ace.dsc
        cp debian/changelog debian.changelog
        cp debian/rules debian.rules
        osc commit
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a new pull request for homebrew-core to update ACE to the new release, see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ace.rb
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a new pull request to Microsoft vcpkg to update ACE to the new release, see https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/ace
      </li>
      <li>
        Mail the approved release announcement out to, at minimum the following:
        <tt>ciao-users@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu</tt>, <tt>ciao-announce@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu</tt>,
        <tt>tao-users@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu</tt>, <tt>tao-announce@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu</tt>,
        <tt>ace-users@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu</tt>, <tt>ace-announce@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu</tt>.
        Do this as yourself (not as bugzilla). <b>N.B.</b>
      You will not be able to post to the users' lists unless you are subscribed to
      them. Odds are you will not be able to post to the announce lists at all. Ask
      someone else (like Doug or Johnny) to do this step.<br>

      Tips to being a Build Czar</h2>
    <p><ol>
      <li>Trust no one.</li>
      <li>Be careful with <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">this guy</a>, he
      is notorious in breaking builds (and fixing them as well...Rumour has it that
      it's actually a super-scalar, super-pipelined processor capable of out-of-order
      execution, in human incarnation).</li>
      <li>Don't forgive people who break ACE :-)</li>
      <li>If a build hasn't run in a long time (symptoms are a "red" in the Last Run
      column of the build scoreboard), delete the .disable file in
      /path/to/build/directory/BUILD_NAME/ by hand.</li>
      <li>Think of the group who wrote the scoreboard update script, every time you
      catch an otherwise not so obvious error with the help of the scoreboard. Tell <a href="mailto:devo-group@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu">
        DEVO group</a> about it.</li>
      <li>Send a note to  <a href="mailto:sysadmin@isis.vanderbilt.edu">sysadmin@isis.vanderbilt.edu</a> asking for the repo to be frozen. Provide them a list of names, including yourself and bczar to be granted write permission.
      </li>
      <li>Compile once on Win32, Linux and Solaris before cutting a micro.</li>
      <li>Trust the release script when making a release. Don't make tar balls by
      hand.</li>
      <li>When all hell breaks loose, don't wait for the nightly builds to monitor
      improvement. Instead manually start the builds.</li>
      <li>Maintain private up-to-date workspaces for problem platforms (read as
      Solaris).</li>
      <li>Don't hesitate to ask for help.</li>
      <li>When you get an account to access the svn repo, make sure you are added to
      the correct groups, for example,
      gid=100(users),5000(doc),5002(acetaodev),5003(cvs). Otherwise you will have
      problem to checkout various modules.</li>
      <li>Install your public key to the different machines you have frequent access
      to avoid typing password.</li>
      <li>Update this page if you have any more tips for future build czars :-). This
      page is in git under <code>ACE/docs/bczar/bczar.html</code></li>

    <h2>Build Czar Arthur</h2>
    <p>Many years have passes since the days of the legendary Build Czar Arthur. His
      duties were given to him by the mystical Lady of the Lake, who outlined the
      first responsibilities of the Build Czar.</p>
    <tt>
      <br>
      Then bespake the Lady of the Lake,<br>
      And these were the words said shee:<br>
      &quot;I knoweth of thy deeds, thou noble Arthur,<br>
      but thy task hath not finished for thee&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Thou shalt feitch thy trusty steed,<br>
      And cleanse thy builds againe;<br>
      Then shallt thy ryde hath finnished,<br>
      When new kits released thee cann.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Then bespake him noble Arthur<br>
      And these were the words said he:<br>
      &quot;With what weapons shallt I use,<br>
      To asure these from the devil free?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Then appeered before noble Arthur,<br>
      Uppon the ground a sacred scroll<br>
      Conjurred by the Lady of the Lake<br>
      Borne of the earth in a roll.<br>
      <br>
      She saies, &quot;Clasp this to thine selfe<br>
      For thee shallt find need for it.<br>
      It shall keep others in the cold,<br>
      Only to be ressurected when thee sees fit.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Others shall join thy person,<br>
      To ryde with thee in thy quest;<br>
      Thee shallt be thankful of theire help,<br>
      And to alsoe hold them steadfast.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;But if theire talke too lodly rise,<br>
      And causeth much damage to thine cuntry,<br>
      He must come forth, and make proclamation,<br>
      For the next one he shall be.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      So hath Arthur to the Lady spoke:<br>
      &quot;For I sweare, and save my othe,<br>
      While enimes and evils I seeke,<br>
      I shall fight against them bothe.<br>
