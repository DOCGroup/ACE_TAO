 software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to
 use, modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the
 DOC software source code and object code produced from the source, as
 well as copy and distribute modified versions of this software. You
 must, however, include this copyright statement along with any code
 built using DOC software that you release. No copyright statement
 needs to be provided if you just ship binary executables of your
 software products.
 .
 You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases
 and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code
 that is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not
 misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself
 or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will
 prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an
 open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're
 using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let
 [10]us know so we can promote your project in the [11]DOC software
 success stories.

 The [12]ACE, [13]TAO, [14]CIAO, [15]DAnCE, and [16]CoSMIC web sites

 of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular

 indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages,
 including without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the
 possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is

 merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose,
 noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade
 practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
 their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to
 the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
 software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington
 University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or

 DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on
 the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
 their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction,
 modification, or enhancement. A [20]number of companies around the
 world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC
 software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is
 Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US
 daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of
 2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for
 the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software
 obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems
 users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they
 upgrade their operating systems accordingly.

 MPC (Licensed Product) is protected by copyright, and is distributed under
 the following terms.
 .
 MPC (Make, Project and workspace Creator) is an open source tool, developed
 by OCI and written in Perl. It is designed to generate a variety of tool
 specific project files from a common baseline. Through the powerful
 combination of inheritance and defaults MPC is able to reduce the
 maintenance burden normally associated with keeping multiple target
 platforms, their unique build tools, and inconsistent feature sets current.
 It is also easily extensible to support new build environments. The
 objective is to solve the prevalent problem of fragile build environments,
 usually experienced by developer groups, by replacing it with a singular
 robust build environment, and an active community of users committed to its
 evolution.
 .
 Since MPC is open source and free of licensing fees, you are free to use,
 modify, and distribute the source code, as long as you include this
 copyright statement.
 .
 In particular, you can use MPC to build proprietary software and are under
 no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using
 MPC. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the MPC code, such as
 copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the MPC code, that will
 prevent MPC from being distributed freely using an open source development
 model.

 LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED AS IS WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND INCLUDING

 LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED WITH NO SUPPORT AND WITHOUT ANY OBLIGATION ON
 THE PART OF OCI OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES TO ASSIST IN ITS
 USE, CORRECTION, MODIFICATION OR ENHANCEMENT.

 Support may be available from OCI to users who have agreed to a support
 contract.
 .
 Liability

 OCI OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH
 RESPECT TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS OR ANY PATENTS BY
 LICENSED PRODUCT OR ANY PART THEREOF.
 .
 IN NO EVENT WILL OCI OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR
 ANY LOST REVENUE OR PROFITS OR OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT AND CONSEQUENTIAL
 DAMAGES, EVEN IF OCI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
