The following directory is a placeholder for the Doxygen
generated files.  The index.html file only makes sense if you download
a ACE-html.tar.gz file from:

https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO

or if you generate the Doxygen documentation using the
configuration files in $ACE_ROOT/etc/*.doxygen and/or the perl script
in $ACE_ROOT/bin/generate_doxygen.pl
