Please use the PRF form below to submit bug reports, problem reports,
etc., to the ACE developers and interested users.  Post it as issue or
discussion at https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO. If you are using OCI,
MicroFocus, or  Riverace's versions of ACE do not use github, but
instead contact those companies for support.  Please paste your
PRF as text, _not_ as an attachment.

We prefer that all bug reports be submitted through github issues.
See https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO/issues for more information
about how to do this. Not using this problem report form
will make it harder or impossible to identify the problem, and in
many cases we will be unable to help at all.  Also please try to
browse the existing github issues and the ChangeLog files to find
out if your problem has been solved in a more recent version of ACE.

PLEASE make your Title: line as descriptive as possible.
Titles like "ACE bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!
Also, do _not_ include the word "help" in the Title!

When including your config.h and platform_macros.GNU files as requested
below, only include the contents if you use the recommended method of
including the platform-specific file in your file. If you use a link
to the platform-specific file, simply state which one - DO NOT
include an entire platform-specific configuration file in the form.
