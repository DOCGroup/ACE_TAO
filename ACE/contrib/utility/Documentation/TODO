New features/changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@@ DefaultImpl<> looks ugly. Is there a way to just write DefaultImpl 
   (or, perhaps some other name)? Maybe also rename Interface to Object
   (will be consistent with Introspection::Object).

@@ Abort facility

@@ Maybe rename converter to convert

@@ Maybe make reference counting object implement Introspection. However it
   will introduce inter-library dependency. Nop, this is a bad idea.

@@ Maybe move <library>.hpp one level up to Utility/.

@@ Go thru C++Templates chapter on RefCounting and SmartPointers and see if 
   anything can be applied?

@@ Examples for many features are missing

@@ Introspection::TypeInfo should use set instead of vector for bases.


Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@@ code in <pre> does not look nice in lynx (see Hetero/index.html for example)


Building environment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Should probably make lib rules to build library when target is test (try to
   run 'make clean && make test' from Utility root).

@@ Makefile variable names inconsistency (e.g. cxx_translation_units and CXX_PREPROCESS_FLAGS)

%% Rename Config to Build or rather BuildRules?

@@ Compiler-specific stuff is left after make clean. Potentially dangerous 
   idea would be to remove everything except known files

@@ Multi-compiler configuration

@@ Building library with sources in sub-directories.


Pre-release fixes
