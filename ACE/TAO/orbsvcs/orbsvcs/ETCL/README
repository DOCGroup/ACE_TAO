# Implement an "Extended Trader Constraint Language" parser.
# This language was defined as part of the Notification Service 
# [give URL] to define filtering constraints.  It is in fact an
# extension on the "Trader Constraint Language", using in the Trading
# Service [URL] to constraint on user queries.
#
# Other services use the same language, including the Logging Service,
# parts of the Fault Tolerance services and (in the future) TAO's
# Real-time Event Service.
