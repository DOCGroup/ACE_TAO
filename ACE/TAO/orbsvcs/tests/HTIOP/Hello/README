/**

@page Hello Test README File

Simple Test to test the functionality and usage of HTIOP protocol

	Please refrain from "improving", extending or expanding this
test, if you need to change

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.


This test also demonstrates how one could use HTIOP with the corbaloc
or corbaname syntax. Note that corbaloc support requires the server register
the object reference with the IOR table internally, the corbaname support
requires the NamingService running.
