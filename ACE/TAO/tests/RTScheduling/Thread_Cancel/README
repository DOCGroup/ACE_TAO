Case
----

This test illustrates the DT cancel mechanism when the DT's are local
(ie. DT's do not span multiple nodes). Four DT's are created. Each DT
has 3 nested scheduling segments. A reference to each DT is
stored. These references are then used to cancel teh corresponding
DT. When the DT is cancelled it throws the CORBA::THREAD_CANCELLED
exception.

To Run
------

./test

Typical Output
--------------

Scheduling Segments for DT 1 :
Scheduling Segment Name - Harry
Scheduling Segment Name - Potter
Scheduling Segment Name - Chamber of Secrets
Scheduling Segments for DT 2 :
