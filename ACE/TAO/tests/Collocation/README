This program performs a series of sanity check on the collocation
support in TAO.  It also serves as an example of how to separate stub
and skeleton + implementation from the main program.

After building the example, you'll get:

        Collocation_Test_Stubs.{dll,so}: This library contains stub implementations.

        Diamond.{dll,so}: This library contains the implementation Diamond object.

        Collocation[.exe]: This program performs the collocation test.
