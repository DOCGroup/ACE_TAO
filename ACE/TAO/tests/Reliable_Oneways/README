@page Reliable_Oneways Test README File

	A regression test for reliable oneways.  The test verifies
that each SyncScope policy can detect the problems that it should
detect, but only those.

- SYNC_WITH_TARGET: the server raises exceptions on a oneway request,
  those should be detectable with this policy, as well as
  OBJECT_NOT_EXIST when the server object is destroyed and TRANSIENT
  exceptions when the server process is terminated.

- SYNC_WITH_SERVER: the exceptions raised by the servant should not
  be detectable, while OBJECT_NOT_EXIST and TRANSIENT exceptions
  should be.

- SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT: only TRANSIENT exceptions are detectable, no
  COMM_FAILURE, OBJECT_NOT_EXIST or the exception raised by the
  servant could be visible.

- SYNC_NONE: only TRANSIENT exceptions are detectable.  It is expected
  that some requests may go through without any exceptions, even after
  the servant is terminated.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_sync_none.pl
$ ./run_sync_with_transport.pl
$ ./run_sync_with_server.pl
$ ./run_sync_with_target.pl

	each script returns 0 if the test was successful.  In addition
you can use:

$ ./run_test.pl

	to run all the tests in a single shot.  Notice that this last
script takes too long for nightly builds.
