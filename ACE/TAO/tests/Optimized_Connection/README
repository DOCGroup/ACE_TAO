        This is a test of the Optimized Connection Endpoint Selector.
The OC provides the means to set a connection timeout.

        For this test we have an IOR which contains unresolvable endpoints.
Normally this will result in the client waiting for a TCP timeout. However
in this test we configure a 1300 milliseconds timeout.

        If in future the IOR endpoint becomes a resolvable address, please
regenerate a valid one using the ../Hello/server.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
