Member example shows how you can build a simple multicast group
using transactional multicast (TMCast). Each member can be either
a sender or a receiver.

The sender sends small messages to the multicast group with a random
wait period in [0, 1] second range. The receiver is simply receiving
those messages and prints them out.

To start the sender you can execute something like this:

$ ./member s sender-1 239.255.0.1:10000

Here the first argument ('s') indicates that new member will be
a sender. The second argument ('sender-1') is an id of the new
member (each member of the group should have a unique id). And
the third argument ('239.255.0.1:10000') specifies IPv4 multicast
address and port (you can choose you own).

To start the receiver you can execute similar command:

$ ./member r receiver-1 239.255.0.1:10000

After you have started both the receiver and the sender you
should see a sequence of messages printed by the receiver.

Note, since the group can exist with only one member for a
very short period of time you should start first two members
virtually at the same time. See TMCast documentation for more
information about why it behaves this way.

You may want to add more than one sender to the group if you
want to see how TMCast operates in a totally-ordered mode.
