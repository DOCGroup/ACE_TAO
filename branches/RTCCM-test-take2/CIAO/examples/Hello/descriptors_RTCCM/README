 README for RTCCM example -- $Id$ --

This subdirectory contains a simple example showing how to use the
RTCCM extension supported by CIAO.  This example doesn't really use
any of the RT capability, rather, it only shows how to associate
component instances with sets of RT policies we wish to apply.  See
$CIAO_ROOT/docs/schema/ServerResourceUsage.txt for more details on how
to put together a ServerResource file (such as the
rt-config-example.scr in this example) to define sets of policies and
how to associate these policy sets with component instances (as in
rt-example.cdp.)

Because the test uses RT scheduling policies to run the
NodeApplication, you will need administrator privilege to successfully
execute the test script, rt_run_test.pl.  Remember to set up the
environment variables (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ACE_ROOT, and CIAO_ROOT) for
the script to execute okay.
