This test verifies that IOR interceptor support is working properly.
It does so by adding a unique tagged component to the IOR.  If the
IOR interceptor support is working properly, then the it should be
possible to extract that tagged component from the IOR on the client
side via the

  PortableInterceptor::ClientRequestInfo::get_effective_component()

method from within a ClientRequestInterceptor, for example.

Run the test as follows:

	$ perl run_test.pl

Output should be very similar to the following:

==== Running IORInterceptor test
(4956|16384) Added tagged component containing the
(4956|16384)   string "FOO_IORInterceptor" to all profiles.
(4956|16384) Added tagged component containing the
(4956|16384)   string "FOO_IORInterceptor" to all IIOP profiles.
(4956|16384) Successfully retrieved effective policy.

(4957|16384) String extracted from tagged component data: FOO_IORInterceptor
"test_i" is shutting down.
Event loop finished.
