This is to test the functionality of the Object Reference Template and
the various other conditions that have to be met according to the ORT
spec.

The various conditions that are tested here are

1. That establish_components() and then the components_established()
   method is called every time a new POA is created.

	For this, I just create some POAs and keep a count on how
many times the establish components is called.

2. An ORT is initialized every time a new POA is created.

3. Check the identity of the ORT using the adapter_name() and such other
   methods in the Object Reference Template abstract valuetype.

	The server and the client are just simple. There will be an
interceptor whose establish_components() and components_established()
methods should be invoked when a POA is created.

4. The other thing to test is that when ever the state of the POA
manager changes, the adapter_manager_state_changed() method is
invoked.  I am not going to do anything about it .. may be just have a
debug statement.

5. And, of course that the application's implementation of the
make_object() is invoked. I wont do anything in it .. just call
create_reference_with_id() again .. may be.

6. Simple checks are for checking if -ORBId and -ORBServerId are
working. But, this can be checked by passing command line parameters
and invoking the corresponding functions to check if they are working
perfectly.

How to run:
===========

Run the server.

./server -o server.ior -ORBId ORT_test_ORB -ORBServerId ORT_test_server

Run the client.

./client -k file://server.ior
