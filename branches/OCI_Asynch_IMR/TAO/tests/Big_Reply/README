	A stress test for receiving large replies. This test is a part
	of the bug 575 test suite. One of the problems that users have
	faced in a reactive configuration is that the clients have not
	been able to receive large replies from the server. This test
	actually tests that feature. This test will not work till we
	check in bug 575 fixes.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
