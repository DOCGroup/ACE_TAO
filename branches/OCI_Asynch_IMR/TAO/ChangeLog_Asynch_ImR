        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Adapter_Activator.h:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Adapter_Activator.cpp:

          In order to support asynchronous interfaces, the adapter has to use the
          default servant rather than the servant locator. The servant locator does
          not give an opportunity for asynch processing.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Forwarder.h:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Forwarder.cpp:

          The initial cut at implementing AMH.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_Service.mpc:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Locator_Options.h:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/Locator_Options.cpp:

          The feature is optional for now at least.

        * tao/ImR_Client/ImR_Client.mpc:

          Add support for generating asyncronous stubs and skeletons for working
          with the ImR.
