        * ace/Countdown_Time_T.cpp:
        * ace/Countdown_Time_T.h:

          Make the countdown time instances nestable. Prior to this change,
          if a function using the countdown time to subtract a duration
          happened to call another function that also used a countdown time
          instance to subtract from the same instance, the inner countdown
          would subtract its span and then the outer one would do the same
          resulting in the same span of time being subtracted twice.
