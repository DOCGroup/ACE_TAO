<h3 align="center">TAO Real-Time Architecture&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This page describes and compares the two main ORB designs we considered for
supporting Real-Time CORBA 1.0 in TAO.&nbsp; The first design, codenamed <i>reactor-per-lane</i>
and shown in Figure 1, was chosen for our initial implementation.&nbsp; The
second design, <i>queue-per-lane</i>, might also get implemented in the future,
as a part of a project evaluating alternative ORB architectures for Real-Time
CORBA. </p>
<h3 align="center">Design I: Reactor-per-Lane</h3>
In this design, each Threadpool Lane has its own reactor, acceptor, connector
and connection cache.&nbsp; Both I/O and application-level processing for a
request happen in the same threadpool thread: there are no context switches, and
the ORB does not create any internal threads.&nbsp; Objects registered with any
Real-Time POA that does not have the <i>ThreadpoolPolicy</i>  are serviced by <i>default
threadpool</i>, which is a set of of all the application threads that invoked
<CODE>orb-&gt;run ()</CODE>.

<p align="center">Figure 1: Reactor-per-lane</p>
<p>When a Real-Time POA is creating an IOR, it includes one or more of its
threadpool's acceptor endpoints into that IOR according to the following
rules.&nbsp; If the POA's priority model is <i>server declared</i>, we use the
acceptor from the lane whose priority is equal to the priority of the target
object.&nbsp; If the
priority model is <i> client propagated,</i> all endpoints from the POA's
threadpool are included into the IOR.&nbsp; Finally, if the <i>PriorityBandedConnectionPolicy</i>
is set, then endpoints from the threadpool lanes with priorities falling into one of the specified
priority bands are selected.&nbsp; The endpoints, selected according to the
rules above, and their corresponding priorities are stored in IORs using a special
<i>TaggedComponent </i><CODE>TAO_TAG_ENDPOINTS</CODE>.&nbsp; During each
invocation, to obtain a connection to the server, the client-side ORB selects
one of these endpoints based on the effective policies.&nbsp; For example, if the object has
<i> client propagated</i> priority
model, the ORB selects the endpoint whose priority is equal to the priority of the client thread making the
invocation.&nbsp; If on the client-side, during invocation, or on the
server-side, during IOR creation, an endpoint of the right priority is not available, it
means the system has not been configured properly, and the ORB throws an exception.&nbsp;
The design and rules described above ensure that when a threadpool with lanes is
used, client requests are processed by the thread of desired priority from very
beginning, and priority inversions are minimized.</p>
<p>Some applications need less rigid, more dynamic environment.&nbsp; They do
not have the advanced knowledge or&nbsp; cannot afford the cost of configuring all of the
resources ahead of time, and have a greater tolerance for priority
inversions.&nbsp; For such applications, threadpools <i> without</i> lanes are a way to go.&nbsp;
In TAO, threadpools without lanes have different semantics that their <i>with-lanes</i>
counterparts.&nbsp; Pools without lanes have a single acceptor endpoint used in
all IORs, and their threads change priorities on the fly, as necessary, to
service all types of requests.</p>
<h3 align="center">Design II: Queue-per-Lane</h3>
In this design, each threadpool lane has its own request queue.&nbsp; There is a separate
I/O layer, which is shared by all lanes in all threadpools.&nbsp;&nbsp;The I/O layer has one
set of resources - reactor, connector, connection cache, and I/O thread(s) - for each priority
level used in the threadpools.&nbsp; I/O layer threads perform I/O processing
and demultiplexing,&nbsp; and threadpool threads are used for application-level request
processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="queue-per-lane.gif" width="387" height="384"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 2: Queue-per-lane</p>
<p>Global acceptor is listening for connections from clients.&nbsp; Once a
connection is established, it is moved to the appropriate reactor during the
first request, once its priority is known.&nbsp; Threads in each lane are blocked on
condition variable, waiting for requests to show up in their queue.&nbsp; I/O
threads read incoming requests, determine their target POA and its threadpool,
and deposit the requests into the right queue for processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center">Design Comparison</h3>
<i>Reactor-per-lane</i> advantages:
<ul>
  <li><b>Better performance</b><br>
    Unlike in <i>queue-per-lane</i>, since each request is serviced in one
    thread, there are no context switches, and there are opportunities for&nbsp;stack and TSS optimizations.</li>
  <li><b>No priority inversions during connection establishment</b><i><br>
    </i>In <i>reactor-per-lane</i>, threads accepting connections are the same
    threads that will be servicing the requests coming in on those connections, <i>i.e.</i>,
    priority of the accepting thread is equal to the priority of requests on the
    connection.&nbsp; In <i>queue-per-lane</i>,
    however, because of a global acceptor, there is no differentiation between
    high priority and low priority clients until the first request.</li>
  <li><b>Control over all threads with standard threadpool API<br>
    </b>In <i>reactor-per-lane,</i> the ORB does not create any threads of its
    own, so application programmer has full control over the number and
    properties of all the threads with the Real-Time CORBA Threadpool
    APIs.&nbsp; <i>Queue-per-lane</i>, on the other hand, has I/O layer threads,
    so either a proprietary API has to be added or application programmer will
    not have full control over all the thread resources..</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Queue-per-lane</i> advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Better feature support and adaptability</b><br>
    <i>Queue-per-lane</i>&nbsp;supports ORB-level request buffering, while <i>reactor-per-lane</i>
    can only provide buffering in the transport.&nbsp; With its two-layer
    structure, <i>queue-per-lane</i> is a more decoupled design than <i>reactor-per-lane</i>,
    making it easier to add new features or introduce changes&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Better scalability</b>&nbsp;<br>
    Reactor, connector and connection cache are <i>per-priority</i> resources in
    <i>queue-per-lane</i>, and <i>per-lane</i> in <i>reactor-per-lane</i>.&nbsp;
    If a server is configured with many threadpools that have similar lane
    priorities, <i>queue-per-lane</i> might require significantly fewer of the
    above-mentioned resources.&nbsp; It also uses fewer acceptors, and its IORs
    are a bit smaller.</li>
  <li><b>Easier piece-by-piece integration into the ORB<br>
    </b>Ease of implementation and integration are important practical
    considerations in any project.&nbsp; Because of its two-layer structure, <i>queue-per-lane</i>
    is an easier design to implement, integrate and test piece-by-piece.</li>
</ul>
