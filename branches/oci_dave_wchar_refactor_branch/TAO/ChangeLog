          Found the trouble that was crashing the endpoint test. It was

        * tao/params.cpp:

          One of my patches inadvertently flipped the sense of the
          share_profiles default from 0 to 1. However, I think that 1
          should be the default, since it generates more compact IORs. It
          has been that way for years in the OCI version of TAO, but I am
          keeping the default 0 here for tradition. This value is
          overridden by using -ORBUseSharedProfile [0|1] ORB_init option.

          The motivation for these changes was to enable support for
          ORB-local Service Objects. This for instance, makes it possible
          for differently configured ORBs to coexist within the same
          proces.

          In order to accomplish this, each orb (core) owns a "Gestalt",
          i.e. a service object repository instance. There is also a
          process-wide, or "global" gestalt, which is the default
          repository where service objects are registered. The latter
          retains the interface and behavioral compatibility with any
          existing code. As a consequence of this design choice, any
          un-named orb(s) will default to using the ubergestalt, which is
          consistent with the prior behavior.

        * tao/DLL_Parser.cpp:

          Fixed the parse_string() method to use the correct ORB gestalt
          when looking up a dynamic service object. That resolves a
          failure in TAO/tests/Object_Loader test.

        * tao/ORB.cpp:

          Relocated some aging comments about having first to instantiate
          the singleton manager to the correct place (ORB_init). Added a
          gestalt parameter to the call to open_services. Edited a few
          lines to fit within the standard length requirement.

        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.i:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Added a member and an accessors for the private service gestalt,
          owned by the core. Replaced the call to methods that use the
          implicit ubergestalt with ones that specify the gestalt to use
          for service objects.

          Added an ACE_Service_Config_Guard to make sure the ORB
          initialization uses the correct repository.

          Updated more references to process_directive() and instance() to
          use ACE_TCHAR.  Updated references to process_directive() to use
          ACE_TCHAR for consistency.

          Added #if !defined(TAO_AS_STATIC_LIBS)/#endif around code, which
          is only meaningful when TAO is _not_ statically compiled;
          Updated the service and DLL symbol names used to load the
          CodecFactory_Loader, PolicyFactory_Loader and
          TypeCodeFactory_Loader dynamic services, in the cases where
          those services are not statically linked and TAO supports
          dynamic linking. (Thanks Ossama, for pointing that out.)  Added
          code to try and explicitly load an IORInterceptor adapter and
          Concrete_IORInterceptor_Adapter_Factory, if TAO supports (is
          built with) dynamic linking;

          Updated the code that loads the IORTable adapter to be exception
          safe; Edited a few lines to fit within the standard length
          requirement.

        * tao/Parser_Registry.cpp:

          Updated to explicitly specify the correct gestalt for the ORB.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.h:
        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:

          Refactored the initialization code to separate process-wide
          aspects of initialization from those having to do with the ORB
          instance. It is necessary to deal with global initialization
          because of the large number of use cases, where the first thing
          a process does is to call ORB_init, and consequently -
          open_services. There are also cases where a process calls
          Service_Config::open, initializing the process-wide
          configuration and only then proceeds to call ORB_init - for
          example when using Service Configurator to load a DLL that uses
          an ORB. The close_service is now only responsible for calling
          close in the ORB's own gestalt, the ACE Object Manager is the
          one that is clobering the process-wide Service Configuration.
          Updated to explicitly specify the correct gestalt to be used.

        * tao/default_resource.h:
        * tao/default_resource.cpp:

          Added the ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency member to the default
          resource factory to expressly maintain the factory's dependance
          on TAO_Codeset library, because the order of destruction may be
          reversed in some cases. The member help us keep our access to
          TAO_Codeset_Manager instances by upping the ref count on
          TAO_Codeset's DLL. This is far from elegant, but a complete
          reference counting scheme for the ORB services is a more complex
          undertaking than what the available resources currently permit.

        * tao/CSD_ThreadPool/CSD_TP_Strategy_Factory.cpp:

          Fixed an (unrelated) issue arising from a call to strcmp() with
          two different character types - only visible when ACE_USES_WCHAR
          is in effect.

        * tao/Codeset/Codeset_Manager_i.h:
        * tao/Codeset/Codeset_Manager_i.cpp:

          (minor) Added void as argument to the ctor and dtor.

        * tao/PI/ORBInitializer_Registry_Impl.h:
        * tao/PI/ORBInitializer_Registry_Impl.cpp:

          Implemented an init() method, which registers all the static
          services, usually taken for granted with the loading of
          TAO_PI. Previously, static initializers were used, however the
          dependent static services were being registered only globally,
          which broke the ORBs that needed ORB-local services.

        * tao/PI/PI.h:
        * tao/PI/PI.cpp:
        * tao/PI/PolicyFactory_Loader.h:
        * tao/PI/PolicyFactory_Loader.cpp:

          Removed the static initializers code and made it part of the
          dynamic service's init method. See the comment above.

        * tao/PortableServer/Root_POA.cpp:

          Explicitly specified the gestalt to be used for registering
          dynamic services.

        * tests/DLL_ORB/Test_Client_Module.cpp:
        * tests/DLL_ORB/Test_Server_Module.cpp:

          Provided an ID for the client and server's ORB.  In the future,
          an option may be devised so that the user can specify if they
          want any ORB to use its own gestalt, even if it does not have an
          ID. The reverse would be to force all ORBs to use the global SR,
          even if they have an ID.  Fixed a a SEGV upon process
          termination. The first thing a client process does in its main()
          is to load a dynamic service - Test_Client_Module, using a call
          to ACE_Service_Config::process_directive(). The service does
          call ORB_init(), which causes the population of the SR with a
          number of static and dynamic SOs. At process termination now
          however, any services registered following the ORB_init () call
          are destroyed first and will be unavailable when the
          Test_Client_Module is finalized. Like the Resource Factory, for
          example.

          The solution is to provide and ORB id for any ORB, which will
          loaded as part of a dynamic service.  Since the service gestalt
          is tied to the ORB id, this will cause the new ORBs to create
          and manage the lifetime of their own Service Repositories. The
          ORB_init() will be invoked in the context of each distinct SR
          and any SO an ORB needs will go there. At process termination,
          the Test_Client_Module will be finalized, which will clobber the
          ORB's SR and any SO registered there.

          This change was of OCI by David.Gibbs@igindex.co.uk. He had
          previously requested the addition of support for SO_KEEPALIVE
          and as a result we found that the framework existed for
          communicating a value of SO_DONTROUTE, so it was decided that we
          go ahead and add the feature. I consider this change provisional
          in that it isn't strictly required and so if someone strongly
          objects to its existence it can be pulled. Otherwise it is
          simply completing what someone else had started a while ago by
          adding configuration values for socket options to IIOP protocol
          properties definition.

          timeout while also using CORBA messaging and the Connection
          Timeout policy. Both of these connection timeouts are
          dynamically loaded and one would override the other. This change
          allows both to be loaded, and if both are initialized to nonzero
          values, the lesser of the two timeouts is used. This results
          from a bug originally reported to OCI by friedhelm.wolf@homag.de.

          These changes support a new technique for active connection
          establishment when presented with a profile containing multiple
          possible endpoints. This commit resolves bugzilla bug #2485.

          The technique in question is "parallel connects" meaning
          attempting to connect to many endpoints simultaniously. It was
          conceived as a way to deal with timeouts when the Invocation
          Endpoint Selector would first try to connect to one or more
          unreachable endpoints. If those endpoints were defined as IP
          addresses (not hostnames) or as resolvable hostnames that
          pointed to unreachable IP addresses, the connection
          establishment would take potentially several minutes to time out
          and eventually encounter a reachable endpoint. In the case of
          shared profiles (those using TAG_ALTERNATE_IIOP_ENDPOINT) this
          delay impacts every single invocation.

          This parallel connect feature (also referred to somewhat
          inacurately as a strategy) avoids this by supplying all the
          endpoints in a profile to the connector and letting it first
          test to see if any are already cached and available, and if not,
          to open connections to each and wait for a winner. When the
          first connection completes, any pending connections are
          terminated.

          In order to minimize the use of pending connections, an iterator
          traverses the list of endpoints creating new connections and
          also checking any existing connections for completion. If the
          first endpoint happens to be reachable and the server responds
          quickly enough, the client may not open any more connections.

          If the server does not respond immediately, a wait strategy is
          entered. This wait strategy may be Reactive or Leader/Follower
          based. In either case, a specal "multi event" type is used to
          allow a single thread to wait on one of many connectors, and
          then to clean up those that didn't finish in time. The parallel
          connect feature is also available using blocking connects, but
          the only advantage there is in checking the cache for all
          endpoints in the profile, there is no performance gain during
          actual connection establishment.

          The parallel connect strategy differs from another endpoint
          selection optimization, available in
          tao/Strategies/Optimized_Connection_Endpoint_Selector.*. That
          strategy works by examining all profiles simultaniously, this
          feature still treats separate profiles separately. This profile
          separation is necessary to support Load Balancing and Fault
          Tolerence. Also, this feature requires additional support to be
          built into protocol specific connectors (IIOP is currently the
          only protocol supporting parallel connects) whereas the other
          feature works regardless of the protocol.

          As this is a new feature, it is disabled by default. Use the
          -ORBUseParallelConnects option to enable its use. A second
          option, -ORBParallelConnectDelay, is used to introduce a small
          delay between the opening of new potential connections if the
          server is particularly busy. This is useful to minimize the
          impact on a busy server if more than one of the available
          endpoints is reachable. Also, because this feature only focuses
          on one profile at a time, the server must be run with
          -ORBUseSharedProfiles enabled (it is disabled by default).

          This is a new test for the parallel connect feature. It works by
          having the server open two endpoints, one aliased to something
          unreachable. The client then uses different wait strategies to
          make invocations on the server and records the time for
          each. These tests also include counter-examples in which
          parallel connects are not used, and these take several minutes
          to run. On my Linux machine the timeout period is about 3
          minutes which causes the overall test to take about 9 minutes to
          run.

          The EndpointPolicy is a new, TAO-specific policy that is applied
          to POAManagers via the POAManagerFactory. This commit resolves
          Bugzilla bug #2484.

          The Endpoint policy acts as a filter for constraining the final
          endpoints or profiles listed in an IOR when it is created by a
          POA associated with the POAManager containing the policy. The
          EndpointPolicy value is a sequence, allow multiple endpoints to
          be published.

          The way this works is that the ORB is initialized with all the
          -ORBEndpoint options it needs to provide access to all the
          objects it will serve. Then POAManagers are created with
          Endpoint policies that contain only the endpoints that are to be
          used for its subset of objects. For instance, the ORB could
          define one endpoint for insecure, internal-use-only objects, and
          another for secure internet-facing objects. Using the Endpoint
          Policy these different objects would only get one or the other
          endpoint. Mechanically what happens is that first all Acceptors
          are queried to construct an MProfile, then the resulting
          profiles/endpoints are compared to entries in the policy, those
          not matching are eliminated. It is possible that an endpoint
          policy will exclude all the profiles, which would result in an
          exception being raised at object reference construction time.

          Endpoints are matched in their final form. This means that if an
          IIOP Endpoint makes use of the hostname_in_ior attribute, that
          is the name the policy will use to match.

          Endpoint values are protocol specific. A value for IIOP is
          provided, but new values must be defined to support other
          protocols. The Endpoint value is a local object. New protocol
          specific values do not have to be added to the
          TAO_EndpointPolicy library, but they must specialize
          EndpointPolicy::ValueBase and the implementation must derive
          from TAO_Endpoint_Value_Impl.

          The profile contains the base endpoint as an attribute. This
          caused a problem for the endpoint removal scheme mentioned
          above. If a profile contains two or more endpoints, and the base
          happens to be the one to be eliminated as a result of the
          endpoint comparison, the only thing that could be done is to
          copy the contents of the first alternate into the base, then
          eliminate the duplicate.

          A new test case for the endpoint policy. This test currently
          fails due to an unresolved interaction with the sequence
          code. The error appears to be related to memory corruption, but
          the cause has not yet been determined. The error only manifests
          when the multiple profiles portion of the test is being
          run. This is where an unmodified IOR would contain two profiles,
          each with one endpoint. The problem does not occur when a single
          profile has two endpoints.

          These files are new/updated to support the POAManagerFactory,
          which was added to the CORBA 3.0.2 specification. The PMF is
          used to allow for the explicit creation of POA Managers which
          can then be supplied to POAs during POA creation. POA Managers
          may now also carry policies which will influence all POAs
          associated with it. This work builds on the effort originally
          started by Johnny Willemsen back in the pre-1.4.8 era. This
          commit resolves Bugzilla bug #1785.

          Fixed a bug in these tests, in the test code for element 0 of
          a string sequence was set and after that the length was set to 1.
          The setting of 0 is possible because the OMG doesn't define
          exceptions for this so it is allowed, then setting the length to
          1 does reinitialize element 0 so that we don't get old values.
          This was not done with the old sequences, then just the old
          value was returned and things worked then.

          These are further valuetype changes that are related to Bugzilla
          #2162. The problem is that TAO assumes that a valuetype's
          typecode is always encoded as 0x7FFFFF02 <repID> but that is not
          compliant with the spec. It is also valid to encode a valuetype
          typecode as 0x7FFFFF00 which indicates that the actual type of
          the value matches the formal type for the argument for which the
          value is a parameter.  TAO already had most of the hooks in
          place to support this, but was missing a key bit of
          functionality. This patch adds that functionality, the ability
          to test that the formal type matches the actual type when
          marshaling values.

          Valuetypes encoded this way are substantially more efficient, if
          the type can be implied then there is no need to carry the
          actual type id.  Unfortunately to do so blindly would break
          backwards compatibility with all previous versions of TAO.
          For the time being, the effective code to cause TAO to marshal
          values using the more efficient typecode is disabled using a new
          compile-time flag, TAO_HAS_OPTIMIMIZED_VALUETYPE_MARSHALING,
          which must be defined to give TAO the opportunity to use this
          new technique. THIS FLAG BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY. It is
          not a violation of the spec to always encode the valuetype's
          type ID when marshaling, so TAO can continue being backwards
          compatible and not be in violation of the spec. The only
          violation comes when failing to unmarshal a value which is using
          an implied type ID.

          I would prefer to not have a compiler flag to guard the use of
          optimized marshaling, but I don't know any other way to do it.
          At the point where the decision is made, there is no reference
          to an ORB Core so there is no easy way to set a dynamic option
          that could be used to selectively control this optimization.

Tue Apr 25 15:14:13 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

          Merging in truncatable valuetype support. This work was done on
          an OCI controlled patch then brought in via patch. The premise
          is to support the "truncatable" keyword for valuetypes as
          defined in sections 3.9.1.3, 5.2.5.3 and 15.3.4.1 of the CORBA
          3.0.3 specification. Practically, this means supporting the
          marshaling of typecode lists and chunked values. Chunked values
          requires the retention of state, namely nesting level, during
          the marshaling. This was handled by creating a new ChunkInfo
          type that is created on the stack during the marshaling of a
          valuetype and is passed through all the intermediate marshal
          methods. This commit resolves Bugzilla #2483

          Valueboxes by definition cannot be made truncatable, but they
          derive from the same valuebase, thus they must support the same
          signature for creating a list of repository ids. Otherwise these
          are whitespace only changes.

          truncatable keyword was defined or not. This also includes the
          definintion of the new ChunkInfo type.

          Fixed duplicate symbols when linking with vc7/vc8. The trading
          service used the TAO_String_Hash_Key class to store strings
          in hash maps, this class is derived from CORBA::String_var which
          has been refactored to a template. This causes problems with
          vc7/vc8 because the base template is exported from multiple
          libraries. This has been resolved by usign CORBA::String_var
          in the hash map and deliver an ACE_Hash, ACE_Equal_To and
          ACE_Less_Then template specialization. This solves now the
          link problems, the runtime issue that appeared after the
          sequence merge has not been fixed yet. Also see bugzilla bug

           RT8248(Bug 1647) is a race condition involving two threads
           active in the same connection handler at the same time.
           The race is fixed by
           ensuring that a connection handler that has allowed its handle
           to be resumed in the Reactor does not return "1" from
           handle_input. "1" is the Reactor's "call me back immediately"
           value. Essentially, you can't give up ownership of yourself twice
           --  you give up owner-ship when you resume the handle, so you
           can't ask to be called back immediately.  (The SSLIOP handler
           is the only one that ever returns 1, so that's the only handler
           in which this manifests itself)

           The additional test (run_test_harsh.pl) is a longer (~5 minute)
           version of the MT_SSLIOP test that fails without this change,
           but succeeds with it.

           Also moved the code for Ciju's "connection close" fix of
           "Fri Dec 16 14:40:54 2005" (this entry is moved from OCI 1.4a)
           from the Connection_Handler.cpp to the Resume_Handle.cpp.

             * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp:

               When the client closes its connections, it sends an EOF
               to the server. The sever reactor gets an event for that
               handler. It first suspends the handler and then dispatches
               a thread to handle_input().Some where down the lane, a read()
               is done on the handle and automatically the handle is resumed.
               At this point another thread CAN enter the reactor and
               since the handle being closed has been resumed, the reactor
               will add it to its fd_set. As expected the reactor gets an
               event on that handle and dispatches someone else to handle
               that event.
               What this patch does is prevent the closing handler from being
               resumed. Thus it never does get added to the reactor
               fd_set and the possibility of getting a nil handler is removed.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (destroy_interceptors):

          Fixed race condition that allowed multiple threads to destroy
          interceptors concurrently.  Thanks to Iliyan for finding this
          race condition.

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_interface.h (be_add_operation):

          Changed the return type from void to AST_Operation*,
          the same type that is returned from the implementation's
          delegation to the private method fe_add_operation. This
          change allows an error in fe_add_operation (which will
          return 0 and probably be the result of a name clash) to
          get propagated up and be reflected in tao_idl's return
          value.

          Changed usage of be_add_operation() to check the new
          return type and return -1 if it is null. The IDL
          compiler formerly would output a 'redefinition'
          (name clash) diagnostic if a user operation name
          clashed with an implied operation name of AMI or AMH,
          and likewise if 2 ports of the same category in a
          component had the same name. Now the IDL compiler
          will also indicate failure when it exits.

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp:

          When the client closes its connections, it sends an EOF to the
          server. The sever reactor gets an event for that handler. It
          first suspends the handler and then dispatches a thread to
          handle_input(). Some where down the lane, a read() is done on the
          handle and automatically the handle is resumed. At this point
          another thread CAN enter the reactor and since the handle being
          closed has been resumed, the reactor will add it to its
          fd_set. As expected the reactor gets an event on that handle and
          dispatches someone else to handle that event. What this patch
          does is prevent the closing handler from being resumed. Thus it
          never does get added to the reactor fd_set and the possibility
          of getting a nil handler is removed.

          Changed to not inherit from 'core' so LifeCycle_Service
          executable is not installed.  It's not a stand-alone service
          like the others in ${TAO_ROOT}/orbsvcs, it is an example for use
          with ${TAO_ROOT}/examples/Quoter.  After x.5.1 we'll try to find
          a better place for this.  See bugzilla issue 2410.

          Initialise some pointers with 0, made some local variables const,
          use true/false instead of 1/0. Fixed bugzilla bug 2323 by:
          - When marshaling recursive unions for each case use a seperate
            stream so that the offsets do get calculated
          - For each recursive type be able to handle multiple members of
            the recursive type, we could only handle one occurence.
          For recursive types we should have more test cases, probably there
          are a few small bugs left in this code but these aren't catched
          by the current regression test suite.

          Mon Feb 27 16:23:50 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

          Introduce a new flag to idl_global to indicate when we need to
          force generation of the skeleton includes. Setting
          non_local_iface_seen_ to be true was causing undesirable side effects
          on non-inlined builds. Generate skeleton includes when the new
          need_skeleton_includes_ or non_local_iface_seen_ is true.

        * tao/Utils/Servant_Var.inl (operator=):
        * tao/Valuetype/Value_VarOut_T.cpp (operator=):

          Fixed problem where non-copying assignment prematurely decreased
          reference count on contained object by adding a check for
          self-assignment.  The canonical copy-and-swap idiom was used to
          provide a strong exception safety guarantee.  It doesn't require
          a self-assignment check for copying assignment but it may be
          needed for non-copying assignment.  Addresses memory access
          violations.

        * examples/RTScheduling/MIF_Scheduler/svc.conf.client:
        * examples/RTScheduling/MIF_Scheduler/svc.conf.server:
          Changed priority policy from direct to continuous.
          The direct does not work on AIX 5.3, but continuous
          seems to work everywhere.

        * tao/Array_VarOut_T.inl:
          Removed a nasty cast that shouldn't be necessary.
          Only broken builds, like MSVC6 should require the
          reinterpret_cast<>, otherwise builds should need
          no cast.  Thus, only the broken compilers should
          be singled out.  Thanks to the XL 7 compiler on
          AIX for pointing this out.

          Reverting a change, added with the commits from
          Fri Feb 10 20:40:31 UTC 2006 and Thu Feb  9 19:59:41 UTC
          2006. The original intent was to ensure that unsecured clients
          can not make invocations on servants, explicitly marked as
          secure. The problem is in that a client-side-only policy
          (Security::SecQoP*) was used, which is not permitted by the
          CORBA specification. An alternative solution, based upon
          SecurityLevel2 SecureInvocationPolicy or SecurityLevel3
          ObjectCredentialsPolicy should be sought. Thanks
          to Ossama Othman <Ossama_Othman at symantec dot com> for
          pointing that out and discussing the alternatives.

          Added insert_into_any methods for all basic types. Thanks to
          Nemoy Michael <michaeln at sintecmedia dot com> for providing
          the patches. This also fixes bugzilla bugs 2371, 2367, and 2422

Tue Feb 21 17:48:24 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * tao/Adapter.h:

          Remove the CORBA::Object_ptr argument from
          ::initialize_collocated_object on TAO_Adapter. We need to call this
          method in circumstances when a CORBA::Object is not available.

        * tao/Adapter_Registry.h:
        * tao/Adapter_Registry.cpp:

          Reflect the above change. Also ::initialize_collocated_object must
          now only return 0 for success if the stub it is working on has been
          fully initialized. The registry reflects this by continuing to try
          adapters until one returns 0.

          Similarly ::create_collocated_object now will potentially call the
          above method on all remaining adapters if, after an adapter has
          created an Object, the Object has not been fully initialized.

        * tao/IORTable/Table_Adapter.h:
        * tao/IORTable/Table_Adapter.cpp:

          Create a common method ::find_object which attempts to locate an
          object in in the table. Implement ::dispatch in terms of this method.

          Implement ::initialize_collocated_object to search the table using
          the above mentioned ::find_object method and, if one is found, to
          forward the stub it is initializing to this object ref. Reflect the
          change in API for ::initialize_collocated_object.

          Add an implementation of ::create_collocated_object in terms of
          ::initialize_collocated_object.

        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Table.h:

          Include the locking changes proposed by Robert Hancock (Robert dot
          Hancock at sedsystems dot ca) on bug #2130 with a couple of small
          mods. Thanks to Robert Hancock for providing these.

          Add a new method ::reinitialize_object to be called on stubs whenever
          an object has been forwarded or has fallen back from a forwarded
          location. This method determines if the stub has become (or ceased to
          be) collocated and performs the necessary actions to set the
          collocation relevent attributes on the stub.

        * tao/Object.h:
        * tao/Object.i:
        * tao/Object.cpp:

          Remove the members TAO::Object_Proxy_Broker *proxy_broker_,
          TAO_Abstract_ServantBase *servant_ and
          CORBA::Boolean is_collocated_ from this class. These are now held on
          the stub. Change all access to these values to delegate to the stub.

        * tao/PortableServer/Collocated_Object_Proxy_Broker.cpp:

          Remove the CORBA::Object_ptr argument from the function
          _TAO_collocation_Object_Proxy_Broker_Factory. It was unused and we
          need to use this when we don't have an Object.

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp:

          Reflect the change in API for ::initialize_collocated_object. Make
          that method and ::create_collocated_object use the new accessors
          for collocation attributes on the stub rather than the CORBA::Object.
  Make ::initialize_object only return 0 for success if it has fully
  completed the intialisation of an object. i.e. it managed to locate
          a collocated servant for the stub.

        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.i:
        * tao/Stub.cpp:

          Add the collocated servant, collocated indicator, and object proxy
          broker members from CORBA::Object to this class with appropriate
          accessors.

          Insert calls to ::reinitialize_object on the stubs ORB core at points
          where the stub may have moved to / from being collocated.

          Together all these changes fix bugzilla bugs #1741 / #2134; #2289;
          #1495; #2130.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/StructDef_i.cpp (members_i):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/UnionDef_i.cpp (members_i):

          Fixed a bug with nested structs/nested unions that results
          in the servant's ACE_Configuration_Section_Key (its
          placeholder in the repository) being changed to the key
          of the nested type, when processing returns to the top level
          Thanks to Richard Spence <richard.spence.extern@icn.siemens.de>
          for reporting the bogus exception thrown in TypeCodeFactory
          that uncovered the problem. This fix closes [BUGID:2407].

          -ORBIIOPProfileLock.

          Changed -ORBConnectionHandlerCleanup to support 0 and 1 as
          arguments.  Previously it only supported false, which made it
          impossible to set the option after the default was changed to
          false last September.  Support false (and now true) arguments
          for backwards compatibility.

          problems where *.idl files in IDL custom_only projects
          weren't listed.  This addresses a large part of the issue
          raised by Vladimir Panov where orbsvcs *.idl files were
          not installed.

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Impl.h:
          Extended documentation

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/AdvSlotExt/*:
          Another new PI test. We test the PI functionality in
          receive_request. When we set a value in TSC, then this should
          be independent of any change in RSC, so we set a value in
          TSC, then another value in RSC and then read TSC again and
          check if we did get the correct value back.

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Impl.cpp (set_slot):
          When this PICurrent has a lc_slot_table set, then copy this
          table we refer to to our own table befor we start modifiying
          our table.

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Copy_Callback.cpp:
          Only copy the slot table from source to destination when the
          destination still refers to the table of the source.

          These changes together fix bugzilla bug 2401 and 2398.

Wed Feb 15 09:01:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Copy_Callback.{h,cpp}:
          Changed the return type of the execute method to void, there
          was no real meaning for the return value

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Impl.cpp:
          Updated for the change of the return value type

          Added a test case for bugzilla bug 2401, in the receive_request we
          modifity the RSC, this should not effect the TSC, this bug has not
          been fixed yet, working on it

Tue Feb 14 08:30:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Regenerate.  Test now requires Strategies library.

Mon Feb 13 15:20:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/FT_ServerRequest_Interceptor.h:
          Changed is_primary from bool to CORBA::Boolean to fix compile
          errors with MacOS. Also removed is_primary method, was just
          declared and I couldn't find any implementation

Mon Feb 13 14:21:42 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_union.cpp (compute_default_value):

          When a clash is found between a declared case label value and
          the initialized default discriminator value for a boolean
          discriminator, changed the method of modifying the intialized
          discriminator defaul value from '++' to '^=', in order to
          be consistent with the changes in

          Thu Feb  9 16:31:17 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          since this type of discriminator value is now stored internally as
          a native boolean instead of a signed long.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_generator.h:

          Changed signature of one of the create_expr() overloads
          to match the signature change to constructors of be_expression
          and AST_Expression in

          Thu Feb  9 16:31:17 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

Mon Feb 13 13:47:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/AdvSlot/server.cpp:
          Improved this test, explicitly put a Long with value 5 in the PI
          slot and retrieve it later, this we can check whether we get
          the correct value back.

Mon Feb 13 13:02:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Copy_Callback.h:

Mon Feb 13 11:19:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/RTCORBA/Thread_Pool.{h,cpp}:
          Create the dynamic threads as detached, they can exit themselves
          when load drops again, so we then can't join on them. Used the
          same flags as for the TPC thread the ORB can create

Mon Feb 13 09:11:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Security/Policies/Foo_i.cpp:

          "CosNamingC.h", as per normal TAO include path conventions.

        * utils/catior/catior.mpc:

          Remove includes += definition.  The include path already has
          orbsvcs via inheritance from namingexe.

        * tests/OBV/ValueBox/Test_impl.cpp:

          Divide sizeof(VBlongarray) by sizeof(CORBA::Long) instead of
          sizeof(long).  Fixes OBV/ValueBox test on systems with 64 bit
          longs.

          Changed base class AST_Decl to use ACE_CString for its
          pd_file_name member, instead of using UTL_String*. Also
          changed static method idl_error_header() to take an
          ACE_CString for the filename argument. Easier to get
          this member type to stick around until we check for
          illegal primary keys, which must be done after all
          other parsing.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/value_typecode.cpp:

          Applied the fix suggested by Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> in [BUGID:2145], since it was
          never supplied by the bug reporter, and closed the entry.

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp (cat_codeset_info):

          Take into account CDR encapsulation byte order when demarshaling
          information from the encapsulation.  Fixes incorrect
          demarshaling in cases where CDR encapsulation byte order does
          not match CDR stream byte order.  [Bug 2400]

Thu Feb  9 21:07:51 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h:

          Changed the signature of the TAO_OutStream operator that
          takes a TAO_ACE_CHECK struct to get a const reference of
          the struct, instead of a non-const reference. In code
          generation, this struct is passed to the operator as a
          temporary, and gcc is evidently catching that a temporary
          shouldn't be passed as a non-const reference (Visual Studio
          did not catch it), but reporting the error as a failure to
          resolve the operator overload.

Thu Feb  9 20:17:37 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.am:

Thu Feb  9 20:06:18 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/FT_ServerRequest_Interceptor.cpp:

          Corrected the use of the length of the passing parameter to a
          function.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/FaultTolerance/FT_Service_Callbacks.cpp:

          Changed the return value of function is_profile_equivalent when
          comparing an IOR and an IOGR. Basically, when you compare an
          IOR and an IOGR, we need to return "DONT_KNOW",not
          "NOT_EQUIVALENT".

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/PG_Object_Group_Manipulator.cpp:

          A fix for using the object reference.

        * tao/IORManipulation/IORManipulation.cpp:

          Corrected the order of adding, removing profiles, and creating
          Object References.

Thu Feb  9 19:59:41 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          This change was adds enforcement for any Security::SecQoP*
          policies applicable on a POA, that may be different from the ORB
          default. It resolves an bug, which allowed security unaware
          clients to make invocations on "secure" objects when the ORB is
          configured with support for Security::SecQoPNoProtection.
          ("Secure" in this context means that the object is activated in
          a POA, for wich security policy was set to at least
          Security::SecQoPIntegrity.)

       * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Invocation_Interceptor.cpp:

          Added code to the interception point to ensure that any
          Security::SecQoP* policies are enforced.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:

          If TAO_ROOT or ACE_ROOT environment variables are set they
          override the path set by 'TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR'.  Both $TAO_ROOT
          and $TAO_ROOT/tao (or $ACE_ROOT/TAO and $ACE_ROOT/TAO/tao) have
          to be added to the list of preprocessor include paths.  Instead
          of unconditionally disabling appending the second include path
          when TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_PATH is defined, we just set it to '.' in
          the case neither TAO_ROOT or ACE_ROOT environment variables are
          set.

          Similarly, disable appending /orbsvcs, /CIAO, and /CIAO/ciao to
          TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_PATH, again setting the include paths to '.'.

          - Replaced all usage of the IDL compiler's internal type
            idl_bool (typedef of long) with native bool. Also
            replaced similarly typedef'd values I_TRUE and I_FALSE.

          - Extended the effects of the -Ge 2 command line option
            (which previously replaced 'ACE_THROW' with 'throw'
            and removed all generation of environment variables
            and forms of 'ACE_CHECK' in user defined operations)
            to remove generation of environment variables and
            forms of 'ACE_CHECK' in all operations, including
            overrides of inherited operations, to replace
            all forms of 'ACE_TRY' and 'ACE_CATCH', and  to
            remove generation of 'ACE_ENDTRY'.

          - regenerated lex.yy.cpp and y.tab.cpp, along with
            the associated diff files.

          - removed the passing of 'TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR/tao' path to
            the preprocessor, when 'TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used
            instead of the TAO_ROOT environment variable.

          - made many cosmetic changes to generated code formatting.

Thu Jan 26 20:36:47 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/be_produce.cpp(BE_cleanup):

          Removed code to destory the temporary holding scope entry in
          the repository after each IDL file is processed. Instead the
          lifetime of that entry is now tied to the repository itself.

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_adding_visitor.cpp (visit_typedef):

          Removed code that replaces a typedef with the same repo id
          with a new entry, which would invalidate any references to
          the typedef entry that other entries may hold. The IFR will
          now throw the BAD_PARAM minor code that corresponds to an
          attempt to create an entry for a repo id that already exists
          in the repository. Thanks to Richard Spence
          <richard dot spence dot extern at icn dot siemens dot de>
          for reporting the problem when the typdef is used as an
          operation parameter. This closes [BUGID:2381].

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IFRService/IFR_Service_Utils.cpp (name_exists):

          Changed the loop to be a FOR loop using the explicit section
          names, rather than a while loop calling enumerate_sections()
          to get each section name.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_i.h:

          Added lock() method to LogRecordStore that returns a reference
          to a ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX.  Changed Log_i and Hash_Iterator_i to
          use the lock (via the ACE_READ_GUARD... and ACE_WRITE_GUARD...
          macros), while removing its use within the Hash_LogRecordStore
          methods themselves.

          This change avoids any race conditions in read-modify-write
          operations (e.g. the set_* methods) that exist when locking is
          done entirely within the LogRecordStore.

          It also avoids acquiring and releasing the lock multiple times
          in the course of a single operation, which resulted in a modest
          performance improvement (~15%) for methods like write_records()
          and write_recordlist().

          In the future, we may want to abstract locking so instead of a
          rwlock it may represent a database session or transaction.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_i.h:

          Added a new member variable to store the log channel's object
          reference.  Until now, the code was calling _this() each time
          the reference was needed.  Not only was this inefficient (the
          reference is a field of each of the the structures used for log
          notification events, so it's needed relatively frequently), but
          also it resulted in the servant being activated in the RootPOA,
          so a transient rather than persistent IOR was returned.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/LogNotification.cpp:

          The event's logref field wasn't being set in state_change() and
          threshold alarm(), even though the log channel object reference
          was being passed to the methods.

Sat Jan 21 01:56:30 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log_i.cpp:

          Call reset_capacity_alarm_threshold () in set_log_full_action()
          if the value is changed.

          If the log full action is DsLogAdmin::halt, capacity threshold
          alarms are triggered when the size of a log exceeds one if its
          capacity alarm thresholds; if the log full action is ::wrap,
          capacity threshold alarms are triggered "as if coupled to a
          guage that counts from zero to the highest capacity threshold
          value".  The specification doesn't describe required behavior
          when changing from one to the other.  Since the recordkeeping
          needed for each option is so different, resetting may be the
          only realistic option --- at least that way we won't be using
          one set of data for the other.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log_i.cpp:

          The current revision of the log service spec is inconsistent
          whether an AttributeValueChange event should generated only if
          the attribute's value actually changed or whether it should be
          sent unconditionally.  TAO's log service implements the former,
          which I believe to be the most useful behavior.  Nevertheless,
          I've filed a defect report with the OMG for clarification.  I've
          also added a block comment to this effect before each instance
          to alert future maintainers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log_i.h:

          Changed set_week_mask() to avoid recomputing week_intervals_,
          updating the record store, and sending an AttributeValueChange
          event if the new mask has the same value as the old.

          Added operator== and operator!= for many IDL generated types and
          sequences.  Use them to compare old and new log attribute values
          to decide whether to send an AttributeValueChange event.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log_i.cpp:

          Although set_week_mask() updated week_intervals_ (an optimized
          representation) from the new mask, it didn't actually save it;
          this resulted in get_week_mask() returning the original value.

Thu Jan 19 02:45:48 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log_i.cpp:

          Call reset_capacity_alarm_threshold () in set_max_size () and
          set_capacity_alarm_thresholds () if the value is changed.  If
          either the max size or the threshold list is changed, the old
          capacity index no longer makes sense.

          Reseting the index means that a ThresholdAlarm event will be
          sent after the next threshold is crossed.  It is unclear whether
          this is the correct behavior.  An argument could be made that an
          event should be sent for each threshold that has already been
          crossed given the new max size or capacity alarm threshold list.

          Unfortunately the current version of the specification does not
          describe what is the correct behavior.

        * tao/Messaging/Messaging_ORBInitializer.{h,cpp}:
          Added a OBV Factory for the ExceptionHolder. At the moment we use
          AMI with collocation disabled the ExceptionHolder is marshaled
          and then tried to be demarshaled and then we need an OBV factory.
          For system exceptions things work fine now, for user exceptions
          always an UNKNOWN exception occurs in the _excep method, the
          meta data which user exceptions we could throw is not available
          in the current callstack so we just can't recreate the correct
          user exception, have to see how we could fix that but
          this is at least a good step in the direction. This only works
          for the new AMI mapping. This is part of the fix for bugzilla
          bug 2350. Thanks to Alan Stokes <alan at alanstokes dot org dot uk>

          The files listed above were modified to fix a problem that was
          observed in two similar tests.  The original problem was observed
          to occur when the test application was shutting down, and is not
          100% repeatable.  It is theorized that a race condition in the
          existing test code, causing the tests to sometimes succeed.

          When the test applications did fail, some platforms caused the
          message "pure virtual method called" to be printed to standard
          error.  A core file, created using Linux (FC3), showed a somewhat
          corrupt stack trace pointing to the implementation of the
          shutdown() operation in the Visual_i (servant) class (test_i.cpp).

          Both tests are very similar, and the following description applies
          to both.  Note that there are details not being described (such
          as the Portable Interceptor usage), but are not important to the
          problem that was fixed (hopefully).

          The test is a "collocation" (thru_poa) test, consisting of one
          application/executable.  A single IDL interface (Visual)
          is declared, and a servant class (Visual_i) is defined that
          implements the interface.

          The test application creates two active objects (ClientTask and
          ServerTask), and two ORBs.  Each active object is given its own
          ORB to use, and then each is activated in a separate thread.
          The "mainline" thread waits until both of the task threads complete,
          performs the expected vs. actual results comparison, and then exits.

          The ServerTask::svc() does the following:

            - Obtain the RootPOA
            - Create/activate the Visual_i servant object
            - Save the IOR to a file
            - Run the (server) ORB event loop.
            - Destroy the RootPOA
            - Destroy the (server) ORB.

          The ClientTask::svc() does the following:

            - Read/convert/narrow the server-side's IOR file into a
              "Visual" object reference (using the ClientTask's ORB).
            - Invoke each of the operations on the (Visual) object reference.
            - Invoke the "shutdown" operation on the (Visual) object reference.

          The problem lies with the servant's (Visual_i) implementation of
          the "shutdown" operation.  The IDL interface, Visual, declares the
          "shutdown" operation to be a "oneway" operation.  The
          Visual_i::shutdown() method is implemented to invoke
          "shutdown(false)" on the (server) ORB.  This is a rather common
          approach taken by many other TAO tests, but the approach doesn't
          work here because the servant object is collocated (thru_poa).

          The "oneway" operations do not work the same way under collocated
          versus remote request contexts.  A collocated oneway request gets
          treated as if it were a synchronous request, for it is the client's
          "requesting thread" that carries out the entire dispatching and
          invocation of the appropriate method on the collocated servant
          object.  Control is not returned to the client's requesting thread
          until the request is completely finished.

          So, the steps that lead up to the problem in the tests is that
          the ClientTask's thread is the thread that ends up invoking
          shutdown() on the (server) ORB.  At some point soon afterwards,
          and before the ClientTask's thread has been given back control,
          the (server) ORB event loop being run in the ServerTask completes.
          This causes the ServerTask thread to continue on in its logic,
          which is to destroy the (server) RootPOA, destroy the (server) ORB,
          and then go away (the ServerTask thread, that is).  Meanwhile,
          the ClientTask's thread left executing a method in an object that
          has been destroyed.  When the stack is unwound, bad things happen,
          and a segmentation fault, with a somewhat corrupt stack trace
          is produced.

          The fix to the tests was to stop destroying the (server) ORB
          in the ServerTask thread.  Instead, the application mainline code
          was modified (Collocated_Test.cpp) to destroy the (server) ORB
          after both the ServerTask and the ClientTask threads have
          completed.

          This change explicitly #includes those headers (most commonly

        * examples/ior_corbaloc/ior_corbaloc.mpc:

          Changed client and corbaname client projects not to inherit
          from portableserver.  These are pure clients.

          Changed corbaname client project to not add status_i.cpp to
          Source Files section.  It's not part of the client.

          Add *_IDL projects for compiling *.idl files.  This eliminates
          duplicate rules that would otherwise result when Makefile.am's
          are aggregated in the automake build.

        * examples/ior_corbaloc/corbaname_client.cpp

          Changed to #include "corbanameC.h" instead of
          "ior_corbaloc_client_i.h", which is actually part of the
          client project.

Wed Jan  4 21:27:38 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ChangeLog:

          Changed "add-log-time-format" to a really ugly lambda expression
          that formats changelog timestamps in UTC and works with both GNU
          Emacs and XEmacs.

Wed Jan  4 11:08:58 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp:

          Fix cut-n-pasto where unsigned long longs / long longs were
          compared with a floating point zero literal. This should be
          benign, but triggers a VC6 bug.

          - Frontend changes necessary to support a backend option
            for the CoSMIC IDL importer that passes a directory
            name instead of a list of IDL files. This option is
            not available for any other backends and should not
            affect their behavior.

          - Added a patch submitted by Ken Sedgwick <ken+5a4@bonsai,com>
            that fixes a bug in the functioning of TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Constraint_Visitors.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Constraint_Visitors.h:

          Changed lock strategy of implicit_ids_, filterable_data_, and
          variable_header_ maps from TAO_SYNCH_MUTEX to ACE_Null_Mutex,
          since accesses to the maps are already protected at a higher
          level.

          Explicitly set the size of the implicit_ids_, filterable_data_,
          and variable_header_ maps to 27, 31, and 31 hash buckets
          respectively.

          A fixed set of 9 keys are stored in implicit_ids_.  With the
          default hash_pjw() hash function, 27 buckets is the smallest
          table where each key is hashed to a unique bucket.  Further
          optimizations, perhaps using a minimal perfect hash, may be
          possible.

          A 31 bucket hash table size was selected for filterable_data_
          and variable_header_ because a typical structured event has very
          few if any attributes, the cost of allocating default (1024 hash
          buckets) size maps outweigh any benefits of fewer hash
          collisions.

          Disable building CSD_Strategy and RTScheduling subdirectories.
          These *.mpc files need major changes to support separate build

        * tao/Strategies/Optimized_Connection_Endpoint_Selector.h:

          A new feature requested by Homag.  This feature is an
          alternative endpoint selector that improves the performance of
          connection establishment when an IOR contains unreachable
          endpoints. The two elements of this optimization are a
          connection cache lookup before attempting any connections and a
          second means for setting the connection timeout without loading
          the AMI library to use the TAO-specific connection timeout
          policy.

        * tests/AlternateIIOP/svc.conf:

          The alternate IIOP test now uses the Optimized Connection
          Endpoint Selector to speed up the selection of the correct endpoint.

        Committing these changes on behalf of Tim Bradley
        <bradley_t@ociweb.com>.

          The following changes were made in order to support a new
          feature that is described in the CORBA 3.1 draft specification.
          The new feature consists of adding the capability to register
          Portable Interceptors with an associated set of Policy objects.
          In addition, a new Policy was introduced: the
          PortableInterceptor::ProcessingModePolicy.  This policy can be
          applied to either client request interceptors or server request
          interceptors.  There are three possible ProcessingMode values:

          - LOCAL_AND_REMOTE (the default)
          - LOCAL_ONLY
          - REMOTE_ONLY

          The policy is used during the dispatching of a CORBA request.
          It comes into play for remote requests as well as collocated
          (thru-poa) requests.  When the policy value is something other
          than the default value, the interception points on the
          corresponding interceptor may or may not be invoked.  For the
          LOCAL_ONLY policy value, the interception points are only invoked
          on the interceptor if the request is a collocated (thru-poa)
          request.  If it is a remote request, the LOCAL_ONLY policy value
          causes the interceptor to not apply to the current request.
          The REMOTE_ONLY has the opposite effect - only remote requests
          cause the interception points to be invoked in the interceptor.

          The server request portable interceptors were being supplied
          with a ServerRequestInfo object that referenced uninitialized
          operation arguments in the collocated (thru_poa) case.

          During testing of the new ProcessingModePolicy, another bug
          was observed.  Client request interceptors were not getting
          the proper "result argument" (both collocated and remote cases).
          The changes made to the tao/PI/ClientRequestInfo.cpp file fixes
          this bug.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_Constraint_Visitors.cpp:

          Changed TAO_Log_Constraint_Visitor constructor to use
          ACE_CString constructors that don't copy or take ownership of
          the string, this allows us to wrap string literals for use as
          map bindings with as little overhead as possible.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_Constraint_Visitors.h:

          Changed lock strategy of property_lookup_map_ from
          TAO_SYNCH_MUTEX to ACE_Null_Mutex, since all accesses to the map
          are already protected at a higher level.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_Constraint_Visitors.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Log_Constraint_Visitors.h:

          Explicitly set the size of the property_lookup_map_ to 31 hash
          buckets.  A typical log record has very few if any attributes,
          the cost of allocating the default (1024 hash bucket) size map
          outweighs any benefits of fewer hash collisions.

          "versioned" stubs/skeletons.

Tue Dec 13 09:27:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Shutdown_Utilities.{h,cpp}:
          The vc8 runtime seems to check wether a signal number is a valid
          one, if not it asserts. The Shutdown_Utilities where just
          calling remove_handler for all signal numbers, changed this to just
          call it for the signals we registered. This way we can end the
          orbsvcs executable with ctrl-c again.

        * tao/Array_VarOut_T.h:
        * tao/Array_VarOut_T.inl:

          In the TAO_Array_Forany_T<> template class:

          - Changed initialization values for the CORBA::Boolean
            nocopy_ member from '0' to 'false'.

          - Removed the 'const' qualifier from the nocopy_ member.
            This member gets assigned to in the class assignment
            operator, and because of this, tools like insure++
            complain. It's a mystery why C++ compilers don't
            complain as well. This fix closes [BUGID:2326]. Thanks
            to Brian Buesker <bbuesker@qualcomm.com> for reporting
            the problem.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/performance-tests/RedGreen/RedGreen_Test.cpp (DTOR):
          Add try/catch block around call to ec->destroy() because it

          gets caught and noticed printed.  We also now catch and print
          any exception raised in the DTOR since there's little chance of
          doing anything about it, and at least this way we get
          information.

        * tests/IDL_Test/constants.idl:
          Added several wstring constants for test

Fri Dec  2 01:35:31 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.am:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/params_dup.c:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/params_dup.cpp:

          Reintroduced `params_dup.c' and removed `params_dup.cpp' file.
          Some C++ compiler/platform combinations cannot handle the broken
          OpenSSL function pointer conversions.  Stick with a C compiler.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/params_dup.h:

          Include the new "ace/config-macros.h" header instead of
          "ace/config-lite.h".  The former can be parsed by C compilers.

        * tao/TAO_Singleton_Manager.cpp:
        * tao/TAO_Singleton_Manager.h:

          Moved static "instance_" pointer to an anonymous namespace
          within the implementation file.  Allows the friend declaration
          to be removed, in turn fixing builds that cannot handle the
          global scope qualifier prepended to that friend declaration.

          Removed unused "preallocated_object" static array.

        * tao/Versioned_Namespace.h:

          Update preprocessor check to use new config-macros.h specific
          include guard preprocessor symbol.

        * TAO-INSTALL.html: Updated this file for VxWorks.
          Thanks to Nathan Anderson <nathan dot l dot anderson at lmco dot
          com> for these suggestions.

Thu Dec  1 20:17:29 2005  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Topology_Object.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Topology_Object.cpp:

          Removed TOPOLOGY_ID from here.  It should have been nmoved when
          the persistence stuff was broken into a separate library.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/XML_Loader.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/XML_Saver.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/XML_Topology_Factory.cpp:

          Moved TOPOLOGY_ID into here since that's all that uses it.

Thu Dec  1 12:08:17 2005  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.h: Revert previous change as it
          apparently confused Borland BC6.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Topology_Object.*:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reconnection_Registry.*:

          Changed manifest constants for TOPOLOGY_ID_NAME, REGISTRY_TYPE,
          RECONNECT_ID, RECONNECT_IOR, and REGISTRY_CALLBACK_TYPE from
          statics within the namespace to being declared in the namespace
          in the header, but defined in the .cpp file.  This de-warns on
          OS X Tiger G++ 3.3 builds, but may also have a minor reduction
          in footprint everywhere since now there will be only one
          instance of these rather than an instance everywhere the
          relevant header gets #included.

          Added 'after += ...' lines to files where projects share one or
          more IDL files. This change will order the builds and eliminate
          concurrency problems in VC8 builds. This is a temporary solution
          until there is time to apply J.T. Conklin's <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>
          approach of creating a separate project in each file that just
          executes the IDL compiler on the shared files, and ordering all
          other projects that build the resulting generated files to
          come after this step.

          New regression test script. Test the TAO SSLIOP under heavy load
          and it will fail. This test takes a long time to succeed so
          didn't put it in the standard test suite. We have no idea why
          it fails, but something is buggy in the SSLIOP support

          When using RTCorba threadpools dynamic threads can be used, these
          will be created on demand but will life forever after that. A new
          option has been added to the RT_ORB_Loader:
          RTORBDynamicThreadIdleTimeout. With this option a number of micro
          seconds can be specified. If a dynamic thread has not performed
          anywork in that time it will end itself. This way dynamic threads
          can go away if the load reduces again on the server, at the moment
          they are needed they are recreated. Because of this some internal
          administration has been updated, argument parsing has been updated
          and the timeout is passed through several interfacs.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_field.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_declarator.cpp:

          Added code generation for explicit inclusionn of
          tao/Managed_Types.h if TAO_(W)String_Manager is seen
          anywhere in the generated code. This inclusion is
          redundant now, but will make it easier to merge the
          new sequence implementation branch, where managed_Types.h
          will be changed to the name of a new file, into which
          templatized versions of TAO_(W)String_Manager have
          been factored.

        * tao/TAO_Singleton_Manager.h (~TAO_Singleton_Manager):

          Made destructor protected to address warnings about a class with

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Profile.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/UIPMC_Profile.h:

          Override the base class ::decode method with one that
          doesn't try and extract an object key from the CDR encoding.
          MIOP profiles don't have an object key marshalled between
          the address info and the tagged components.

          This fixes bug #2316.

        * tests/Bug_1670_Regression/Bug_1670_Regression.mpc:

          Added 'after' line in one project to avoid concurrently
          clashes in VC8 builds, since the two projects share an
          IDL file.

          to be able to know the complete type for the template arguments
          to its ACE_Auto_Ptr<> private instances.  Various circular
          dependencies make that difficult to impossible without
          restructuring, so we take this approach instead.

          This change should eliminate warnings from Windows-based
          compilers (e.g., VC8) about calling delete through a pointer to
          an incomplete type while instantiating ACE_Auto_Ptr<> methods.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.cpp:

          Only needed a forward decl in Object.h; we only needed the
          complete type in Object.cpp.  Maybe this will help footprint.

Wed Nov 23 09:20:03 2005  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

          Fix a few things I should have caught in the Great Merge, but
          missed.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Consumer.cpp (dispatch_request): Change
          from using deprecated TAO_DEFAULT_MINOR_CODE to TAO::VMCID.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp: Use
          real C++ static_cast<> rather than deprecated ACE_static_cast().

Wed Nov 23 14:53:09 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/ForwardRequest/PI_ForwardRequest.mpc:

          Added an 'after' line to one project to avoid concurrency
          collisions in VC8 builds, since the 2 projects in this file
          share IDL.

Wed Nov 23 14:31:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/OBV/ValueBox/client.cpp:
          This test was doing a few release calls to much causing it to
          crash.

Wed Nov 23 14:07:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuebox/valuebox_ci.cpp:
          Make sure all generated pointers are initialised to 0

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/run_test_ipv6.pl:
          Updated these scripts because of the following change, use
          1|0 instead of YES|NO
          Tue Nov 22 07:49:59 2005  Douglas C. Schmidt

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredPushConsumer.cpp:

          Fixed warnings about preferring one conversion over another
          from a _var that appeared on a couple of platforms.

Tue Nov 22 07:49:59 2005  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init): Updated the code to use 1 or 0 for
          options, rather than YES or NO.  Thanks to Abhi Sachdev for
          motivating this cleanup.

        * docs/Options.html: Updated the documentation to remove the use of
          YES and NO as options and replace them with 1 or 0 to be
          consistent with the other options.

Tue Nov 22 04:14:05 2005  Bala Natarajan  <bala_natarajan at symantec dot com>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_traits.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.mpc:

          Rather than disable this project in the ACE_FOR_TAO
          configuration, inherit from acesocketslib_for_tao to allow it to
          be used.

Tue Nov 22 09:33:30 (IST) 2005  Bala Natarajan <bala_natarajan@symantec.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.mpc:

          Do not build in ACE_FOR_TAO configuration.

Mon Nov 21 19:28:51 2005  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannel.h: Removed mistakenly left
          in attempt to #include EventChannel.inl.

Mon Nov 21 22:22:41 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuebox/valuebox_cs.cpp:

          Removed commented out code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_traits.h:

          Added code generation of Value_Traits<> template
          specialization for boxed valuetypes. Thanks to
          Johnny Willemse <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for reporting
          the missing code. This fix closes [BUGID:2311].

Mon Nov 21 20:14:09 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/RTCORBA/Private_Connection/RTCORBA_Private_Connection.mpc:

          Added an 'after' line for one of the two projects, since they
          share an IDL file and VC8 concurrency features need an
          ordering.

          This entry is the result of an accumulation of many changes in
          the OCITAO repository for the Notification Service and the
          subsequent merge of those changes back to DOC.  There have been
          general changes to improve code formatting in accordance with
          ACE guidelines, improve lax checking of emulated exceptions, and
          the like, so these sorts of changes are not noted on a per-file
          basis.

          These changes include changes from the following OCITAO 1.4a
          OCIChangeLog entries:

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Server.cpp:

          Added #include of valuetype header file to that the service can
          use valuetypes portably.

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Service.cpp:

          Made some error messages more informative and removed dead code.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Admin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ConsumerAdmin.cpp:

          Improved/removed crufty comments.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/AllocTracker.h (ACE_WIN32_HEAP_MONITOR):

          Explicitly scoped reference to CrtHeapDumper to address a
          compiler error.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.cpp:

          Changed methods using TAO_Notify_Method_Request_Queueable to use
          a pointer rather than a reference.  This improves expectations
          in areas of code that take the address of the reference and
          store it or treat it as a pointer.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Consumer.cpp (dispatch_request):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/CosNotify_Service.cpp:

          Handle COMM_FAILURE and TIMEOUT exceptions when pushing to a
          consumer. These exceptions used to result in simply discarding
          the event, but now they are considered a failure, and consumer
          resources will be released.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Consumer.cpp (dispatch_batch):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:

          Fixed the detection of dead consumers for batches of events, so
          that killing (or crashing) a consumer will correctly discard
          remaining queued events for that consumer, and prevent new
          events from being queued.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/CosNotify_Service.cpp:

          Simplify the types of threads from "dispatching, listener,
          source, and lookup" to simply be "consumer" and "supplier"
          threads.  This is the way they were used, anyway.

          Changed the info message printed at startup to correctly
          indicate that -DispatchingThreads threads are used
          *per-consumer_admin*.  Previously it indicated that the thread
          pool was per-channel.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannel.cpp (destroy):

          Fixed a memory leak where event channel destroy was not cleaning
          up the admins.  This avoids circular reference counting problems
          similar to those described in the next entry.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ConsumerAdmin.cpp (destroy):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannel.cpp (destroy):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.cpp (destroy):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxyConsumer.cpp (destroy):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ProxySupplier.cpp (destroy):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/SupplierAdmin.cpp (destroy):

          Fixed exceptions=0 builds logical error in destroy methods and
          made certain all owned circular refcounted members are released
          in class::destroy methods.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.cpp (init):

          Prefer ACE_Auto_Ptr<> to auto_ptr<>.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Dispatch.h (event_var_):

          Eliminated 'const'.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Event.h (CTOR):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Event.cpp (CTOR):

          Changed potentially confusing name of argument; it had "_var"
          appended when it was really a pointer of sorts.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Lookup.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Method_Request_Lookup.cpp:

          Eliminated 'const' on event_var_ data member and changed
          potentially confusing name of local variable in copy() b/c it
          had "_var" appended when it was really a pointer of sorts.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Constraint_Visitors.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Notify_Constraint_Visitors.cpp:

          Changed the filterable_data_ and variable_header_
          maps. Previously they contained a CORBA::Any* which was not
          properly reference counted; the reference count was always one
          regardless of the number of threads using the Any.  Now it is
          changed to contain the light-weighted CORBA::Any Object. Now the
          "bind" method for the map will pass in the value from
          StructuredEvent by value. Since the payload object of the
          CORBA::Any is reference counted, we are safe.

          This change fixed a Notification Service crash.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Object.h (lock_):

          Added new mutex to serialize access to state variables.  In the
          past, the notification service reused mutexes for different
          purposes, allowing a mutex in one scope to be used in a
          different scope.  When we started using reference counting on
          objects properly, these scopes occasionally crossed, creating
          deadlocks, race conditions, and all other sorts of mayhem
          associated with misuse of mutexes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Peer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Proxy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/ProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/PushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/PushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/PushSupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/PushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequenceProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushSupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredProxyPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredProxyPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredPushConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredPushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredPushSupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredPushSupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/XML_Persistence/run_test.pl:

          Changed how the persistence specific methods handle nil object
          references - since TAO throws an exception with url ref styles
          on nil references.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/README:

          Changed "ListenerThreads" to "SourceThreads".

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Reactive_Task.h (timer_):

          Changed to private scope.  There was no need for it to be
          anything but private.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Refcountable.h (TAO_Notify_Tracker):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Refcountable.cpp (TAO_Notify_Tracker):

          Added class to track reference counted objects in the
          notification service.  This is disabled by default, and enabled
          by setting the preprocessor macro
          TAO_NOTIFY_REFCOUNT_DIAGNOSTICS to 1.  Note that currently this
          class requires the availability of the STL map and string
          features.

          Use CORBA::Long for reference count rather than compilation
          environment's 'long'.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Routing_Slip.cpp:

          Updates to use isSet() predicate on TAO_Notify_Event::Ptr.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/ThreadPool_Task.cpp:

          Remove the fix for zombie threads, and instead use THR_DETACHED
          to avoid the problem entirely.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Topology_Factory.h (DTOR):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/EventChannelFactory.cpp:

          Add explicit virtual destructor to get around the problem in g++
          4.0 where inlines get hidden.  Without the virtual DTOR, this
          class does not get exported and code that dynamically loads
          classes derived from this class cannot access this type and
          access the derived instances through pointers of this type.
          This happens most notably when loading topology persistence
          mechanisms via the Service Configurator.

          The actual code for the do-nothing destructor is in
          EventChannelFactory.cpp.  I did this because the only chunk of
          code that uses Topology_Factory is already in that file, and it
          didn't seem terribly reasonable to create a completely new file
          to hold a do-nothing implementation of a destructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/XML_Topology_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/XML_Topology_Factory.cpp:

          Added explicit virtual destructor for the same reasons as
          described immediately above.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/AnyEvent.cpp:

          Changed ANY_CODE from being static to being
          scope-local.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Any/PushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Sequence/SequencePushConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Structured/StructuredPushConsumer.cpp:

          Removed asserts associated with parameters. If a param is not
          optional we throw a BAD_PARAM exception.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Basic.mpc:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/XML_Persistence/XML_Persistence.mpc:

          Provide explicit exenames for each project.  While not strictly
          required, this is "best practice" because it eliminates the need
          for MPC to open each source file and search for the pattern
          "*main*" to intuit an exename.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/Sequence.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_ETCL_Filter/Notify_Sequence_Push_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_ETCL_Filter/Sequence_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_ETCL_Filter/Sequence_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Filter/Notify_Sequence_Push_Consumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Filter/Notify_Sequence_Push_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Filter/Sequence_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Filter/Sequence_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Sequence_Multi_Filter/run_test.pl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/XML_Persistence/main.cpp:

          Fix incorrect use of pacing interval and other test issues.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Discarding/Notify_Structured_Push_Consumer.cpp:

          Fixed ACE_DEBUG printf-style message that had one too many
          arguments.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Reconnecting/event.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Reconnecting/ns_mt_both.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Reconnecting/ns_mt_topo.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Reconnecting/ns_st_both.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Reconnecting/ns_st_topo.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/XML_Persistence/svc.conf:

          Changed name of factory function used to dynamically load
          persistence mechanism to be consistent with the new use of
          ACE_FACTORY_NAMESPACE_DEFINE.

        Merged changes from OCI TAO 1.4a that optionally supports the
        serialization of requests. (See OCIChangeLog entry
        "Mon Nov  7 09:31:11 MST 2005  Tim Bradley  <bradley_t@ociweb.com>"
        for details.)

Wed Nov  9 15:59:01 2005  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Bug_2234_Regression/client.cpp

        Fixed a warning on the OS X build.

          Added exception raise to test_callback() in idl. This would fix the
          warnings on borland builds.

Wed Nov  9 10:20:05 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/CSD_Strategy/TestInf/csd_pt_testinf.mpc:

          Removed duplicated dependency on pi and codecfactory and removed
          dependency on interceptors since it's not needed and it makes the
          test library not built on minumum corba build.

Wed Nov  9 14:25:41 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/constants.idl:

          Reverted the change of

          Tue Nov  8 20:11:47 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          since that constant value is being used to address an Intel compiler
          bug, and the value itself is a legal one. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing this out.

Tue Nov  8 20:11:47 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/IDL_Test/constants.idl:

          Changed the literal rhs for one of the constants
          to a value that won't challenge compilers that are not
          compliant with the ANSI/IEEE minimum positive value for
          double. This change should eliminate a warning on
          SuSE 9.3 ICC90.

Tue Nov  8 11:49:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Bug_2074_Regression/Bug_2074_Regression.mpc:
          Added minimum_corba as base project

Tue Nov  8 10:41:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/server.cpp:
          Slightly changed this server, when we directly have all expected
          messages then there is no need to wait for anymore. If we don't
          have all messages, we print how many we have and then we run
          the orb for another 5 seconds to see if we get extra messages

Tue Nov  8 10:25:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_octet_sequence.hpp:
          Reimplemented the copy constructor and implemented the assignment
          operator in terms of using the copy constructor

Tue Nov  8 10:01:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Makefile.am:

          a BOOST_CHECK to chekd that we correctly return a null pointer

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_octet_sequence_ut.cpp:
          Trying to test the normal sequence behaviour and the special
          TAO optimization when TAO_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES in one file
          will make things hard to maintain, this file now just tests
          the default behaviour, the special behaviour is now done in the
          new unit test listed below.

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_octet_sequence_nocopy_ut.cpp:
          New unit test file

Tue Nov  8 08:49:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_octet_sequence.hpp:
          Specialization for unbounded octet sequences, enabled when
          TAO_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES is defined to 1. This is not
          ready yet, but this way it is easier to share the code
          and build it on multiple systems

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/Unbounded_Octet.cpp:
          Include unbounded_octet_sequences.hpp

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_octet_sequence_ut.cpp:
          Added a first extra test for when TAO_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES
          is defined

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_value_sequence.hpp:
          Enabled the explicit for the single argument constructor

        * tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/run_test.pl:
          Reduced test time to 10 seconds, long enough

Tue Nov  8 08:02:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/RTScheduling/Request_Interceptor.h (Client_Interceptor):

          Re-exported this class.  The export declaration was
          inadvertently removed.

        * tao/ORB_Core.i (add_tss_cleanup_func):
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (add_tss_cleanup_func):

          Moved this method out of line.  Allows the
          TAO_Cleanup_Func_Registry class to remain unexported from the
          TAO DLL.

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/TypeCode_Constants.h (_tc_UnknownUserException):

          Removed this forward declaration.  It's DLL linkage ends up
          differing from the same declaration in the DynamicInterface
          library.  Addresses "inconsistent dll linkage" warnings from
          VC++.

        * tao/PortableServer/POA_Current_Impl.h (POA_Current_Impl):

          Re-exported this class.  Unfortunately, some other TAO libraries
          make direct calls on this class.  Addresses unresolved symbol
          errors.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/field_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/field_cs.cpp:

          Added a 'const' qualifier to the generated member mutator
          argument for array member types, since this arguement has
          the same semantics as an 'in' operation argument.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_obv_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_obv_cs.h:

          Change generation of the initializing constructor definition to
          simply call the corresponding member mutators in the constructor
          body. This change allows reuse of the copy semantics already
          generated in the various member mutator methods, and as a side
          effect, avoids a VC6 compiler bug that complained when we had
          a call to the base class initializing constructor in the
          derived constructor's initialization list.

          This is a footprint reduction fix, eliminating a library dependency.
          TAO 1.4 introduced a new dependency on the Messaging, Valuetype,
          PI, and CodecFactory libraries for the CosNaming_Serv and
          CosEvent_Serv libraries.  Turning off CORBA Messaging did not remove
          this dependency. Thus, any application that uses CosNaming_Serv or
          CosEvent_Serv, but not CORBA Messaging, depends on those libraries
          anyway. This change eliminates the CosNaming_Serv and CosEvent_Serv
          dependencies on Messaging (and thus PI, CodecFactory, and Valuetype)
          when CORBA Messaging and Interceptors are turned off.  It reduces
          the footprint in that case by about 600K.
          There is a ACE ChangeLog entry with the same timestamp that
          descibes the MPC config file changes.

          Splitted PortableInterceptor::IORInterceptor into IORInterceptor
          and IORInterceptor_3_0. This is triggered by bug 1271 which contained
          issues about CORBA Compliance. In the 3.0.3 spec the IORInterceptor
          was splitted. This fixes bug 1271.

          IMPORTANT!!!
          If you use IORInterceptor methods components_established,
          adapter_manger_state_changed and adapter_state_changed you have to
          derive your implementation from IORInterceptor_3_0 else these
          methods don't get called!!!

          For IDL types that are added to the IDL compiler's
          AST via an FE_*Header class (interfaces, valuetypes,
          eventtypes, components, and homes), modified the
          creation of this class to pass in a scoped name
          created on the heap instead of on the stack.
          Memory allocated within this scoped name was being
          freed in a different scope, and it's dangerous
          to assume that the stack address would still be
          valid. Also added a destroy() method to the
          FE_InterfaceHeader class (base class to all the
          others) that handles the destruction of the scoped
          name member and its contents, if it is nonzero.

          The current Codec just encode/decodes wstring without
          using the codesets. When wstrings are encoded/decoded
          this causes problems. We found that there has been
          raised already an issue at the OMG for this: issue 6050,
          see http://www.omg.org/issues/issue6050.txt
          This proposes a new IDL method on CodecFactory,
          CodecFactory::create_codec_with_codesets.
          With this method a Codec can be created with specific
          codesets in place. We implemented this method in TAO,
          the only thing we will add soon is the extra check whether
          the requested codeset is supported, this is not possible
          at this moment because the codeset interfaces are not really
          setup in a way to do this.

Thu Oct 20 13:39:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Enabled the new AMI implementation as described in the CORBA
        3.0.3 specification. All tests and examples are updated to the
        new spec but if you want to use the old specification for
        your application then define TAO_HAS_DEPRECATED_EXCEPTION_HOLDER
        in your config.h and rebuild the core libs and the TAO IDL compiler.
        This deprecated AMI support will be kept alive until x.5.1 has
        been released and then we will zap it completely from the
        TAO distribution.

        When you want to update the application code for the new mapping,
        all _excep methods in the reply handler must be updated. Change
        the interface specific exceptionholder in the interface to
        ::Messaging::ExceptionHolder, change in the implementation the
        raise_x call to raise_exception.

Tue Oct 18 17:24:26 MST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Merged in the CSD (Custom Servant Dispatching) feature from OCI.

        The main changes to existing code are:

          - Four hooks are added to TAO_Root_POA to notify the CSD when poa
            is activated/deactivated and servant is activated/deactivated.
            Some areas of the code were instrumented to call these hooks to
            notify the CSD Strategy object of POA activation and deactivation
            "events".  Likewise, code was added to notify the CSD Strategy object
            of servant activation and deactivation "events".
          - A virtual method do_dispatch() is added to the TAO_Object_Adapter so
            the CSD object adpater can override the default implementation to
            dispatch the requests to the CSD strategy.
          - The remote requests and the collocated oneway requests are cloned when
            they are dispatched to the CSD strategy. To support the TAO_ServerRequest
            clone in the CSD library, the friendship is added to the TAO_ServerRequest
            class and it's data member classes such as TAO_Service_Context class,
            TAO_Operation_Details class and TAO_Tagged_Profile class.

        * tao/PortableServer/Root_POA.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/Root_POA.h:

          Added four hooks.

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/POAManager.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/ServantRetentionStrategyRetain.cpp:

          Instrumented to call the hooks.

        * tao/operation_details.h:
        * tao/Service_Context.h:
        * tao/Tagged_Profile.h:

          Added friendship with CSD_FW_Server_Request_Wrapper to support
          the TAO_ServerRequest clone in CSD library.

        * tao/TAO_Server_Request.h:

          - Changed the operation_details_ to be pointer to const
          TAO_Operation_Details object instead of const pointer to const
          TAO_Operation_Details object. This change is made to accommodate
          the change of TAO_ServerRequest clone in the CSD library.
          - Added friendship with CSD_FW_Server_Request_Wrapper to support
          the TAO_ServerRequest clone in CSD library.

        * tao/PortableServer/get_arg.h:

          Made the get_in_arg template function check whether the
          detail argument is nil. If the detail is not nil and the
          argument list in detail is nil(collocated oneway case) then it
          will demarshall the input CDR stream and get arguments. This
          change is made to accommodate the changes in TAO_Operation_Details
          clone that writes the argument list to the input CDR of the
          TAO_ServerRequest object.

        * tao/Intrusive_Ref_Count_Base_T.cpp:
        * tao/Intrusive_Ref_Count_Base_T.h:

        * tao/Intrusive_Ref_Count_Handle_T.h:

          These are two new classes that provide infrastructure-level support
          for classes that need an "intrusive" reference counting mechanism.

Tue Oct 18 00:19:41 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init):

          Corrected minor typo in previous commit.

Tue Oct 18 00:08:30 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/SystemException.cpp:
        * tao/SystemException.inl:

          Moved concrete SystemException constructors out of line again.
          The intended footprint decreases were unfortunately not seen
          across all platforms.

        * tao/ORB.h (resolve_service):

          Removed unnecessary return type and emulated exception
          parameter.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (resolve_service):

          Use snprintf() to simplify integer-to-string conversion and
          string concatenation.  Thanks to Jiang Wei <jw dot tao at sduept
          dot com> for providing a patch.

          Optimized to only determine multicast port if multicast default
          initial reference is enabled.

          Removed unused "return_value" variable.

          (resolve_initial_references):

          Updated calls to resolve_service() to reflect new signature and
          void return type.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init):

          Simplified code that sets Name Service default initial
          reference.

          Updated names of multicast-capable service IDs to match the new
          names in tao/objectid.h.

        * tao/objectid.h (TAO_MCAST_SERVICEID):

          Addressed global namespace pollution by placing this enumeration
          within the TAO namespace.  Also prepended each service ID
          enumerator with "MCAST_" to further reduce potential internal
          TAO namespace pollution.

        * tao/params.h:
        * tao/params.i:

          TAO_MCAST_SERVICEID is now TAO::MCAST_SERVICEID, as changed in
          tao/objectid.h.

Tue Oct 18 06:45:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/DynamicInterface/DII_Invocation.h:

Mon Oct 17 09:24:13 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * tao/orbconf.h:
        * tao/Messaging/ExceptionHolder*.*:
        * tao/Messaging/OldExceptionHolder*.*:
          Added also the new ExceptionHolder. Old and new are guarded with
          TAO_HAS_DEPRECATED_EXCEPTION_HOLDER. This is enabled at this
          moment until the new mapping is fully working, at that moment
          we remove this define from orbconf.h and it is up to the user
          to enable the old mapping

Mon Oct 17 11:40:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Messaging/*:
          Moved the ExceptionHolder to its own file (OldExceptionHolder)
          the latest CORBA spec describe an updated ExceptionHolder
          and this impacts the AMI generated but also user written
          code. Working on this new spec but we will keep the old
          mapping supported until x.5.1 has come out. By moving
          this to its own file we can easier support the new one

Mon Oct 17 11:19:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Messaging/*:
          Regenerated all files with the latest version of the idl

Sun Oct 16 12:05:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Buffering_Strategy.cpp:

          Merge changes from OCI TAO 1.4a to fix build errors for exceptions=0
          builds, remove the hard-coded repository IDs and the unneeded pragma
          prefix from this test, add various missing #includes for Windows
          builds, disable use of IFR persistence, add a new test script for
          this example, and make some changes to Consumer.cpp to make the
          script reliable.  Thanks to Paul Calabrese <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>
          and Chad Elliott <elliott_c@ociweb.com> for originating these
          changes.

Fri Oct 14 09:35:33 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.am:

          Regenerate.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent.mpc:

          Split out separate project for generating IDL files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ec_typed_event.mpb:

          Remove IDL Files section from project, they've been moved
          to ec_typed_event_idl.mpb.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/ec_typed_event_idl.mpb:

          New base project containing Typed Event IDL files.

Fri Oct 14 11:25:17 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

          Merge some changes from OCI TAO 1.4a that are mostly
          documentation.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:

          Move the documentation for the -g option from the front end
          to the back end.  This causes it to not be in the help message
          of other IDL processors (like tao_ifr) as it is specific to
          tao_idl.
          Add an error check to the processing of -t (avoids a core if
          no argument is passed).

        * docs/interfacerepo/tao_ifr.html:

          Document some missing options.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:

          Rename the servant_name variable and documentation to object_id.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Kokyu_Factory.cpp:

          Fix the scope settings for kokyu scheduling.

Fri Oct 14 14:45:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/DynamicInterface/ExceptionList.cpp:
          Use prefix increment/decrement and store the value after decrement
          in a temporarily variable and use that check whether to delete
          ourself to prevent a possible double deletion.

Fri Oct 14 14:07:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/run_test.pl:
          When the exe can't be spawned break directly instead of waiting
          for a minute

Fri Oct 14 08:55:07 2005  Ciju John  <john_c@ociweb.com>

        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Acceptor.cpp:

        Added new IIOP specific option 'reuse_addr' which would be
        provided to the -ORBEndpoint option to control socket level
        option SO_REUSEADDR being set/unset.

Fri Oct 14 12:13:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          64bit fixes

Fri Oct 14 09:08:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        From James Megquier <jmegq at radiance dot com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Service.h:
          This should be in the notification project, removed include of
          PortableServer, just add some forward declarations, this is
          an interface class, no need to pull in portableserver library

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.mpc:
          Moved service to Notification project

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Property.h:
          Added typedef for ULong property

Thu Oct 13 13:12:12 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/examples/ImR/Combined_Service/ImR_Combined_Service.mpc:

          Add synthetic dependencies for the gnuace build so that IDL-
          generated files used by more than one project won't be compiled
          multiple times simultaneously (with parallel builds), which may
          result in corrupted object files.  Thanks to Simon Massey for
          pointing out this problem in a scoreboard build.

Thu Oct 13 12:26:47 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Minor coding convention updates.  Class members outside of a
          base member initializer list should be referenced with the
          "this" pointer (e.g. this->client_request_interceptor_adapter_).

        * tao/Pseudo_VarOut_T.h:

          Added unimplemented copy constructor and assignment operator
          that accept a TAO_Base_var parameter.  Prevents invalid
          widening.

        * tao/Pseudo_VarOut_T.inl:

          Explicitly initialize TAO_Base_var in the copy constructor
          base member initializer list.

        * tao/SystemException.cpp:
        * tao/SystemException.inl:

          Inlined concrete system exception constructors and static
          _tao_any_destructor() method.  Since they are small, a good
          footprint decrease is achieved by doing so, especially since
          only a few of the concrete SystemExceptions are used within
          TAO.

        * tao/UserException.cpp:
        * tao/UserException.inl:

          Likewise.

          Moved _tao_type() method of out of line.  Since it is virtual
          inlining can cause RTTI related problems when using g++ 4.x's
          "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden" feature.

        * tao/TSS_Resources.cpp:

          Do not use "this" pointer in base member initializer list.  It
          is not guaranteed to be available until after base member
          initialization is completed.

        * tao/TSS_Resources.h:

          Minor include directive reorganization.

        * tao/PI/ClientRequestInterceptor_Adapter_Impl.h:

          Cosmetic update.

        * tao/PI/ClientRequestInterceptor_Adapter_Impl.cpp:
        * tao/PI/ClientRequestInterceptor_Factory_Impl.cpp:

          Corrected ACE_RCSID macro arguments.

Thu Oct 13 12:03:05 2005  Steve Totten  <totten_s@ociweb.com>:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_DynamicImplementation.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_Event_Loader.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_ProxyPushSupplier.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_TypedEventChannel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/CEC_TypedProxyPushConsumer.cpp:

          Applied several changes from OCI's TAO 1.4a release to fix problems
          in the Typed Event Channel implementation.  The primary fixes are to
          properly handle consumer/supplier disconnects when using typed event
          channels, and to properly deal with unresponsive push consumers when
          the reactive consumer control is used.  Also fixed some memory
          leaks.  Most of these changes originated from Jonathon Astle
          <jon@astle45.fsnet.co.uk> and Paul Calabrese
          <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>.

Thu Oct 13 10:06:22 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Any/Recursive/client.cpp:

          Added recursive union test case.

Thu Oct 13 11:54:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        From James Megquier <jmegq at radiance dot com>
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Notify/Service.{h,cpp}:
          Added destructor to fix runtime gcc4 problems. Fixes bugzilla
          2262

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification.mpc:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.am:
          Added new cpp file

Wed Oct 12 19:26:48 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * docs/notification/reliability.html:

          Fix library name in service config file examples.

          Fix formatting of NotifyExt.inl excerpts.

Wed Oct 12 12:47:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/server.cpp:
          Run the orb 3 seconds instead of 1 and print out how many
          messages we expect so that it is easy to see how many
          messages we didn't receive.

Wed Oct 12 10:53:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp,i}:
        * tao/Transport_Queueing_Strategies.{h,cpp}:
          Added new flush strategy. For asynchronous calls we now have
          the following behaviour:
          - Normal oneways are not explicitly buffered, but when send
            returns EWOULDBLOCK we buffer the message and schedule for
            output, we just send the data later and don't explicitly
            flush things, we return control directly to the app
          - Oneways with SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT, SYNC_WITH_SERVER and
            SYNC_WITH_TARGET, we don't explicitly buffer but when
            send returns EWOULDBLOCK we buffer things, but we do
            then explicitly flush things
          - When SYNC_NONE is specified, this is the same as
            TAO::SYNC_EAGER_BUFFERING and we do buffer then things
            explicitly

        * tests/Reliable_Oneways/client.cpp:
          After doing all calls run the orb for 3 seconds, this way at
          least all queues are flushed

        * tao/Strategies/SCIOP_Transport.cpp:

          Remove not needed include of tao/Sync_Strategies.h

Wed Oct 12 09:06:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Transport_Queueing_Strategies.{h,cpp}:
          Renamed Sync_Strategies to Transport_Queueing_Strategies, this is
          what it are, and there was already a todo that a rename should be
          done. Also use bool instead of int where usable and there is no
          need to export these classes.

          Emulated exception macros are not maintained anymore, so it

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/discriminant_ci.cpp:

          In the generated body of the _default() method for a
          union, which sets the discriminator to its default
          value (the _default() method is not generated unless
          the discriminator can have a valid default value),
          added a call to _reset(), which will free memory
          allocated for the existing active member. The former
          behavior, without the call to _reset(), was producing
          a memory leak in many cases when _default() is called
          on an instantiated union. Thanks to Georg Lohrer
          <news@tropezien.de> for reporting the problem.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/union_cs.cpp:

          Minor change to generated code formatting.

        * tao/Sync_Strategies.cpp:
          Changed the default for flush for TAO_Transport_Sync_Strategy to
          false. This means that when an application does oneway calls or
          AMI calls, we only buffer at the moment the send block and we
          schedule the transport for output but don't do a forced flush
          at that moment. We just control to the app and send out the data
          later when the socket is free again.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/drv_extern.h:

          Added some commonly used include paths to the list that is passed
          by the IDL compiler to the preprocessor, and to its own
          internal list of include paths. Some are necessary to find
          canonical IDL files without requiring command line include
          paths (the include path to find orb.idl was already added
          internally in the IDL compiler), while others are paths to
          files commonly included in applications. The current order
          of include paths is:

          1. $ACE_ROOT/TAO
          2. $ACE_ROOT/TAO/tao
          3. -I command line options
          4. $ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs
          5. $ACE_ROOT/TAO/CIAO
          6. $ACE_ROOT/TAO/CIAO/ciao

          The last 3 can be overridden by the user, by passing in alternate
          paths ahead of these 3 on the command line, but this practice
          is almost sure to cause link problems.

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/Any_Unknown_IDL_Type.cpp (_tao_decode):
          Take over the version of the source cdr. For example the
          (de)marshaling of a wstring is dependent on the GIOP version,
          it can be that we get a 1.1 version to decode, by default the
          version is 1.2 and when we don't take over the version number
          we try to decode a 1.1 version streams as 1.2 version which
          will fail. When we take over the version we correctly decode
          the stream later as 1.1. Thanks to Lothar Werzinger
          <lothar at tradescape dot biz> for reporting this issue
          and supply a test case. This fixes the Codec test in our
          daily builds.

          calls it now calls the new method send_asynchronous_message_i

          obtained from the base projects we derive from.

          Set TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR to $(includedir)/tao for automake

          Yet another emulated exception fix.

Thu Oct  6 10:02:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Big_AMI/*:
          Added new test to test the behaviour of AMI when sending
          large request. We shouldn't block in that case. Perl script
          will follow but put the files now in cvs so that I can build
          the server remotely and then test AMI between two hosts that
          are connected using the internet. Testing things locally doesn't
          show the issues I want to address

          Implemented the handling of IDL native declarations in an
          IDL operation exception list. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing out that, in the latest
          version of the CORBA Messaging specification, the
          ExceptionHolder valuetype contains an operation with this
          use case.

Mon Oct  3 12:37:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/RTCORBA/Thread_Pool.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Fixed deadlock that occured when a ThreadPool was being destructed
          when the ORB is still running. At that moment we did a wait on
          the thread pool wait the lock on the thread pool manager was still
          hold which resulted in a deadlock. Now each Thread Pool lane has
          its own lock to guard its state, the lock in the thread pool manager
          is just to guard the map in the manager. This fixes bugzilla bug
          #2235.
          Thanks to Anders Olsson <Anders dot EPK dot Olsson at ericsson dot com>

        * tao/LF_Event.cpp (state_changed):
        * tao/LF_Event.h:

          There was strange problem that showed up during our testing
          here. The problem happens only on peers that have server threads
          waiting for requests,  effectively leaving some threads hanging
          around LF waiting for the reply, when infact the reply was
          received by the server thread -- sort of missed wakeups.

          Problem: Server threads that wait for requests can process
          replies (for requests initiated by client threads) since they
          can get to the reactor right away and become leaders within the
          reactor. What happens when a reply is received by a server
          thread before a client thread adds itslf as a follower (in the
          LF loop as a follower)? Disaster.

          Context: Why disaster? The server thread, never bound by the
          synchronization in the LF, would pick the reply. It would
          check for the follower (without holding the LF lock), and since
          the follower is still joining the follower list, the LF_Event
          would not have a follower pointer. The server thread would then
          simply exit state_changed () without waiting for a follower. The
          client thread that becomes a follower will never get a wakeup
          signal and continue to hang around blocking a resource.

          Solution: Do wakeups only with the locks held. Grab LF lock
          before thinking of doing wakeups, which would allow clients
          languishing to set the follower pointer.

          To implement the solution, all I did was to change the interface
          of state_changed () to pass in a LF reference.

        * tao/Connection_Handler.cpp (close_connection_eh):
          Removed some asserts that triggered when a RTCorba ThreadLane
          was destroyed from a thread not belonging to this ThreadLane,
          now we just have a fallback when the reactor associated with the
          event handler is zero. This fixes bugzilla bug #2244. Thanks to
          Bala for validating my ideas.

        * orbsvcs/tests/HTIOP/AMI/Makefile.am:
        * orbsvcs/tests/HTIOP/Hello/Makefile.am:

          Regenerated.

        * orbsvcs/tests/HTIOP/AMI/HTIOP_AMI.mpc:
        * orbsvcs/tests/HTIOP/Hello/HTIOP_Hello.mpc:

          Add "*idl" projects for compiling *.idl files. This eliminates
          duplicate rules that would otherwise result when Makefile.am's
          are aggregated in the automake build.

        * configure.ac:

          Updated AC_CONFIG_FILES for the new directories.

          Added BUILD_REPO, BUILD_THREADS, and BUILD_EC_TYPED_EVENTS
          automake conditionals.  Explicitly set to false, true, and
          true (at least for now).

          If there is no primary key specified, we don't want to
          enqueue a 0, since the queue will then be non-empty but
          have no usable value to dequeue.

            what this enum value is used to express.

          - Added new error enum value EIDL_ILLEGAL_PRIMARY_KEY, to be
            used in the check for illegal primary key described below.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp:

          Added check for illegal usage of a valuetype as a primary key.
          The CCM spec puts several constraints on valuetypes that are
          used as primary keys, and making sure these constaints are
          satisfied requires checking the valuetype's inheritance
          graph, as well as recursively checking its members. Valuetypes
          used as primary keys are place in a list, and the list is
          checked after all parsing has finished, so that we can be
          sure all forward declared structs and unions have been
          fully defined.

        This fixes bug 2234.
        The Portiable Interception call to arguments() attempts to create
        a read-only copy of all arguments passed into the current method.
        Unfortunatly during the call to receive_request() the "out" args
        of variable length types have not yet been allocated by the server
        and so are NULL pointers. A deep copy was being attempted which
        de-referenced these NULLs causing a crash. Explicit NULL checks
        are now performed for these types and a NULL pointer to the type
        is placed into the arg list instead.

            AST_Union, AST_Array, AST_Sequence, AST_Typedef,
            AST_Interface, and AST_Valuetype. The override in
            AST_Valuetype is empty at this time, but when finished,
            the method will be called on a valuetype when it is used
            as a primary key of a component. The method will check
            the various constraints put on valuetypes used as
            primary keys by the CCM spec. It will, among other
            things, be called recursively on the valuetype's members.

          - Made some accessor methods, such as base_type() and
            field_type(), const.

          Reverted a C++ cast back to a c-style cast, vc6 can't handle

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/run_test.pl:
        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/server.cpp:

          This test was destroying the orb before the orb was
          finished sending requests. The test still fails intermittently,
          because sometimes events are lost. I tried changing SYNC_NONE to
          SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT, but this didn't help. This may be a real
          TAO bug. I changed the run_test.pl to run more iterations so
          that the bug should happen more often.

          Changed the way the test works so that it prints an
          error if too many messages are received. Added a -e parameter
          when starting the server in the run_test.pl to expect the
          correct number of events when running multiple clients. Added
          additional debugging output. Changed the default number of
          events from 12000 to 1200 to make the test run faster.

        * tests/Big_Request_Muxing/client.cpp:

          This test was changed a while back to decrease the
          amount of time it takes to run.  However, a time value of 2
          miniutes was overlooked (and was causing problems during test
          shutdown).  I have changed it to be 10 seconds.

Thu Sep  1 19:07:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.{h,cpp}:
          Restored -n to the original behaviour, it is the name that will
          be used to register to the naming service. With the new option
          -x we can indicate that the event service shouldn't register
          with the naming service. This is just as the other orbsvcs,
          thanks to JT for indicating this.

        * docs/ec_options.html:
          Updated

Thu Sep  1 16:54:53 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface_strategy.cpp:

          Fixed typo in comment.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (gen_stub_ctor):

          Fixed order of generated base class stub constructor calls
          when the interface has both concrete and abstract parents.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_amh_pre_proc.cpp (visit_interface):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp:

          Disabled all AMH-related code generation for interfaces that
          have an abstract ancestor. The AMH_-prefixed
          classes have an inheritance structure that reflects that of
          the corresponding IDL interfaces. This poses a problem
          when the interface has an abstract ancestor, since no skeleton
          code is generated for abstract interfaces.

        * tests/IDL_Test/fwd.idl:

          Just after an interface with a concrete and an abstract parent,
          added another interface with the same parents in reverse order.
          This change is to test the order of generated base class stub
          constructor calls in the stub inline file.

Thu Sep 01 08:30:31 2005  Gary Maxey  <gary.maxey@hp.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/union_typecode.cpp:
          Add extra underscore in generated names to help reduce conflicts
          with user supplied names.

Thu Sep  1 14:54:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.{h,cpp}:
          Made it possible to just pass -n to indicate that no service
          name should be used. At that moment the Event_Service will not
          register itself with the naming service. If also the default
          scheduling service option (none) is used, then the naming
          service is not used at all. This is usefull for systems where
          the Event_Service is with the option to write the IOR to file,
          then the user doesn't need the naming service.

        * docs/ec_options.html:
          Documentated the commandline options of the Event_Service executable

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp:

          Removed some unnecessary code.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (redefine):

          Changed the method to handle the use case where an interface
          with one or more abstract parents has been forward declared,
          then fully defined. The IDL compiler maintains an internal
          queue of interfaces with mixed (abstract and concrete)
          parentage, in order to generate overloads of CORBA::release()
          and CORBA::is_nil(). The process of full definition after
          forward declaration ends up deleting the node that has
          been put in the queue (just after redefine() returns), so
          we now update the queue inside the redefine() method. Thanks
          to Paul Friberg <p.friberg@isti.com> for providing the
          sample IDL that uncovered the bug.

Wed Aug 31 18:24:12 UTC 2005  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * docs/Options.html:
          Corrected description of option ORBUseSharedProfiles which in
          reality is 'ORBUseSharedProfile' (without the 's') and by
          is *disabled* instead of enabled!

        * tests/Any/Recursive/NonRecursive.idl:
        * tests/Any/Recursive/RecursiveHello.mpc:

          New IDL containing non-recursive structures that triggered the
          TAO_IDL recursive type false positive problem described in bug
          2225.  This IDL will be used to prevent such problems from being
          reintroduced.  Thanks to Bruce MacDonald
          <brucemac at netcomuk dot co dot uk> for supplying this IDL.

          Removed code that abuses ._retn() to release orb, poa,
          naming context, etc.  This may have been done because
          the driver class was previously a file-scope static,
          but now that it's allocated on the stack within main()
          we can let the destructor release these variables.

        * tao/default_resource.cpp:
        * tao/Strategies/advanced_resource.cpp:

          Added markers within the code to specialize TAO components with
          concrete implementations. This commit relates to the commit on
          Sun Aug 28 14:25:07 2005 Arvind S. Krishna
          <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu> on specializing middleware
          components. The motivation here is added for sake of clarity.

          As a part of the Feature Oriented Customizer (FOCUS) tool being
          developed in my research, we are trying to specialize framework
          implementation and strategies within middleware with concrete
          counterparts when their implementation/type is known a priori.
          FOCUS provides an XML based transformation engine, where the
          specialization transformations are captured in XML file and a
          weaver specializes the code.

          To help in this transformation process, this commit adds markers
          within the source code. These markers are added as special
          comments. For example, //@@
          REACTOR_SPL_INCLUDE_FORWARD_DECL_ADD_HOOK represents a hook
          where forward declarations and include files are added by the
          weaver. As these markers are comments therefore should not
          affect normal applications in *any* manner. Additionally,
          applications that use multiple reactor implementations not be
          affected/do not need any change. Currently, these
          specializations are targeted for TAO middleware, where
          applications know the target reactor a priori and want to
          leverage the specialization to improve performance.

        * TAO_IDL/include/idl_global.h:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:

          Fixed the command line parsing to preserve the literal
          quotes if they are used in an include path that has a space,
          so the path is passed to the preprocessor with the literal
          quotes following '-I'. Since the string is also added to
          the IDL compiler's list of include paths this way, the
          literal quotes must also be stripped off when using the
          include path to form a full path for validation of
          included files. This fix closes [BUGID:2219]. Thanks to
          Dorian Hileaga <hdorianh@hotmail.com> for reporting the
          problem.

        * tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp:

          Do the registration and deregistration. One could possibly think
          of doing a suspend and resume instead of
          registration/deregistration. Our reactor interfaces do not
          provide a way to add a handler in a suspended mode. Doing a
          registration and then calling suspend () could provide a window
          of time where a thread could be dispatched. Hence the decision to
          use registration/deregistration combo.

          Add a new compile-time setting to TAO that controls whether output
        CDRs are reset() after a request is sent. Enabling this feature greatly
        reduces memory usage in some situations such as event services that
        occasionally send large messages. However, it also currently exposes
        (or introduces) a multi-threading bug introducing deadlocks or infinite
        loops. One (of several) test that can show the problem is
        TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Basic/run_test.pl notify.mt.conf.

          Add a new constructor for input CDR that allows specifying a ACE_Lock* which
        will be used to protect the ACE_Data_Block used in the CDR. This will be
        used by the Any impl above. The current implementation uses a global mutex
        to protect all instances, because the internals of the Any impl will
        be copied around, and there's no way to give ownership of the lock to the
        actual ACE_Data_Block that uses it.

Thu Aug 25 11:00:47 2005  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

          This does two things in the Real Time Event Service:

          1. Added a new dispatching strategy--Thread Per Consumer.  This
          strategy is similar to the MT dispatching strategy in that it
          separates the thread that receives the push() from a supplier
          from the thread that does the eventual push() to the
          consumer(s), but it differs from MT in that MT has a pool of
          threads pulling from a single queue and ultimately potentially
          servicing every consumer, whereas TPC has a queue for *each*
          consumer and, thus, a single thread dedicated to pushing to that
          consumer.  This insures that a badly-behaved consumer CANNOT
          have an adverse effect on the channel or supplier.

          2. It adds a means by which an application can specify what the
          RTEC should do if the TAO_EC_Queue fills up.  This behavior is
          encapsulated in a derivation of an ACE_Service_Object, called
          TAO_EC_Queue_Full_Service_Object.  The RTEC looks for a service
          object of a particular name (default in macro
          TAO_EC_DEFAULT_QUEUE_FULL_SERVICE_OBJECT_NAME)

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RTEvent_Serv.mpc:

          Updated to build new files that are part of the TPC strategy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.h:

          Added new data member to hold the name of the service object
          used for queue full behavior.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.cpp:

          Added new option, -ECQueueFullServiceObject, that can be used to
          specify the name/tag in the svc.conf file through which the RTEC
          should look for a queue full service object.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Defaults.h:

          Added default service object name/tag,
          TAO_EC_DEFAULT_QUEUE_FULL_SERVICE_OBJECT_NAME.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.cpp:

          Added the TAO_EC_Simple_Queue_Full_Action service object
          implementation into here, since only the TAO_EC_Dispatching_Task
          needs to know about it.  This default implementation has only
          two choices of behavior: "wait" for not-full condition (the default) or
          "discard" silently.  Specification of the desired behavior is by
          putting the word "wait" or "discard" as the first argument in this
          object's svc.conf arg vector.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.i:

          Created new macros, TAO_EC_QUEUE_LWM and TAO_EC_QUEUE_HWM, that
          can be used to specify the low-water and high-water marks for
          the TAO_EC_Queue.  Previously, these were hard-coded values.

          Modifications to CTORs to allow passing of a service object
          pointer from the factory down through the dispatching strategy
          down to the dispatching task itself.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_TPC_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_TPC_Factory.cpp:

          Minor modifications to pass the service object to the
          dispatching strategy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_TPC_ProxySupplier.cpp:

          Rather than cluttering the EC_Default_Factory with yet another
          dispatch strategy, this derives from the EC_Default_Factory and
          replaces certain behaviors with its own.  Thus, in order to use
          this new strategy you will have to replace the call in your code
          for TAO_EC_Default_Factory::init_svcs() with
          TAO_EC_TPC_Factory::init_svcs().

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h: Moved event_channel_,
          consumer_, and refcount_ into "protected" section so subclasses
          can have access.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.h: Moved event_channel_

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (gen_stub_hdr_includes):

          Another round of generated include directive reording to address
          template related order of parsing issues in g++ 3.4.x or better.

        * tao/Any_Insert_Policy_T.h (any_insert):

          Made these methods non-virtual.  All binding is done at
          compile-time so there is no need make them virtual.  Also
          addresses "class with virtual funtions but no virtual
          destructor" g++ 4.0 warnings.

        * orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Event_Logging_Service/Event_Logging_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Event_Logging_Service/Event_Logging_Service.h:

          Changed the event_log_factory_ member variable from a
          TAO_EventLogFactory_i to a pointer to a TAO_EventLogFactory_i.
          This delays execution of the constructor, which avoids the ORB
          being constructed implicitly, which in turn allows any -ORB...
          command line arguments to be parsed and removed from the argc/
          argv vector in Event_Logging_Service::init_ORB().

        * tao/Typecode_typesC.h:

          Removed unnecessary include directives.  They were causing
          headers to be included that prematurely caused some templates to
          be parsed before all non-dependent names were parsed.  Addresses

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (gen_stub_hdr_includes):

          Reordered generated include directives so that Any/TypeCode
          include directives are placed before ones from the ORB core to
          make sure some things are parsed before some templates
          (e.g. TAO_Pseudo_{Var,Out}_T).  Addresses issues with compilers
          that require all necessary non-dependent names be parsed prior
          to parsing templates that may use them (e.g. GNU g++ 3.4.x or
          better).

        Thu Aug 18 14:28:45 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Con.cpp:

          Removed uses of Any::value() and replaced them with the
          generated extraction operator.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_arg_traits.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_arg_traits.h:
          When Any generation is not enabled, generate Any_Insert_Policy_Noop
          as insert policy for the any, that way we don't get dependent
          on the AnyTypeCode library

        Wed Aug 17 13:27:16 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

          In generating the include of *C.h in *A.h, added generation
          of the prefix "tao/" if we are processing a .pidl file, since
          in that case, the *A.h file will not be in the same directory.

        * tao/PortableServer/BD_String_SArgument_T.h
          Removed the specialization for bound (w)string from the TAO
          lib and just generate the full Arg_Trait in the IDL compiler,
          this makes it not needed anymore to have an insertion
          method for the bound (w)string in the AnyTypeCode adapter

        Tue Aug 16 20:03:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface_fwd/any_op_ch.cpp:

        Tue Aug 16 18:52:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          Removed pragma push/pop for msvs, those warnings are already
          disabled in general

        * tao/Array_VarOut_T.{h,inl}:
          In the TAO_Array_Forany_T make the pointer in the constructor
          const to get things compiling with the new any insertion

        Mon Aug 15 19:56:10 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_nodule/module_ch.cpp:

          Where namespace openings and closings are generated, add
          generation of the same openings and closings in the *A.h
          file, if the -GA option is being used. This change ensures
          that typecode declarations for types nested in one or more
          modules will themselves appear in the same scope.

        Mon Aug 15 19:52:50 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Loader.cpp:
        * tao/PI/PICurrent_Loader.h:

          Change library name in ACE_FACTORY_DEFINE and ACE_FACTORY_DECLARE
          to TAO_PI (where the modified files are located) instad of TAO.

        Mon Aug 15 19:14:16 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/BiDir_CORBALOC/TimeServer.cpp:

          Added #include of "tao/AnyTypeCode/Any.h".

        Mon Aug 15 19:10:43 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup.mpc:

          Removed the extra subgroup labeled OBRSVCS_COMPONENTS. This is
          not used on any platform and it creates an extra subdirectory
          in the MSVC 7.1 solution browser.

        Mon Aug 15 09:52:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          Generate the A.h includes in the header file instead of the cpp file.
          When A.idl includes B.pidl which includes C.pidl, when we generate
          the includes in the header file, then in AC.h we don't have the types
          from CC.h.

        Fri Aug 12 12:59:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PI/ORBInitializer_Registry_Impl.cpp:
        * tao/PI/PICurrent.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Made PICurrent on the client side working again. When PICurrent is
          requested and used, then we allocate a key in the orb tss resources
          and create the PICurrent_Impl at that moment. The server side of
          PICurrent is now the next todo.

        Fri Aug 12 09:54:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/ORBInitializer_Registry_Adapter.h:
        * tao/PI/ORBInitializer_Registry_Impl.{h,cpp}:
          Changed the way the number of allocated slots is passed to PICurrent.
          This is now completely handled in the PI library, it is not up
          to the ORB anymore. This makes the ORB unaware of PICurrent

        Thu Aug 11 15:56:51 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

          Fixed the logic of generating a *A.h include associated
          with an included .pidl file to determine whether the
          .pidl file is located in $TAO_ROOT/tao or in a subdirectory,
          and thus whether to include the *A.h file from the
          AnyTypeCode library or not. Only .pidl files in the
          $TAO_ROOT/tao directory itself have their associated
          *A.* files moved to the AnyTypeCode library.

          Removed calls to the visitor classes in the files
          below that have been removed, and removed the -GT
          command line option and the associated usage message.
          The IDL compiler now generates no explicit template
          instantiations, and has no command line option to
          do so.

          Changed the interface of TAO::Argument. Instead of using
          Dynamic::Parameter as argument, use the method interceptor_
          value that gets an Any* argument and a separate mode argument
          to get the mode of the argument (in/out/inout). Instead of
          duplicating this mode method, added InArgument, InoutArgument,
          OutArgument and RetArgument class that implement this method.
          All templates are then derived from the correct base method.

        Tue Aug  2 12:17:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/AnyTypeCode_Adapter_Impl.{h,cpp}:
          Adapter implementation. _tao_type for all systemexceptions
          is not available

        Tue Aug  2 12:02:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/ExceptionA.cpp:
          Reenabled CORBA::Exception Any operators now _tao_type is available
          again

        Mon Aug  1 19:18:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp}:
          Removed class TAO_DONT_CATCH, it is not used at all. Also removed
          the emulated exception argument from create_system_exception, it
          is not needed

        Mon Aug  1 19:06:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/AnyTypeCode_Adapter.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/SystemException.cpp:

        Mon Aug  1 18:10:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/SystemException.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/UserException.{h,cpp}:
          Removed _is_a, it is TAO specific to handle environments without
          RTTI but we require and use that, so zapped this method.
          Reimplemented SystemException::_tao_get_omg_exception_description
          to use dynamic_cast to check for the specific exception type

        Mon Aug  1 15:22:59 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/DynamicA.h:

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp}:
          Declared _tao_type as pure virtual. No need to have a default
          implementation here

        * tao/ORB.{h,cpp}:
          Optimized InvalidName::_downcast. Implemented _tao_type as
          return 0, we don't have a default implementatio anymore in the
          base

        * tao/PolicyC.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/WrongTransactionC.{h,cpp}:
          Made _tao_type active again, implement this as return 0 at this
          moment, have to call a new adapter later

        * tao/SystemException.{h,cpp}:
          Added _tao_type again, implemented it as return 0, have to add
          a call to an adapter later for all system exceptions

        * tao/UserException.{h,cpp}:
          Added _tao_type with return 0 as default implementation, coming
          from the base

        Fri Jul 29 19:23:17 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:

        * tao/DynamicInterface/DynamicParameter*.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/AnyTypeCode/DynamicParameter*.{h,cpp}:
          Moved DynamicParameter to the AnyTypeCode lib. The PI lib uses this
          and having it in DynamicInterface will make PI dependent on
          DynamicInterface

        Fri Jul 29 11:02:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/AnyTypeCode/Exception.{h,cpp}:
          Moved Any code from Exception to AnyTypeCode. Have to solve the

        Fri Jul 29 10:42:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/AnyTypeCode_methods.h:
        * tao/AnyTypeCode/TypeCode.h:
          Moved is_nil and release from TypeCode.h to AnyTypeCode_methods.h

        Fri Jul 29 04:19:55 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/CORBA_methods.h:

          Removed static CORBA is_nil() and release() methods for
          NamedValue and NVList.

        * tao/SystemException.cpp:

          Restored definition of static _tao_any_destructor()
          methods for system exceptions. They are used by Anys,
          but do not depend on them. This move eliminated
          'inconsistent dll linkage' warnings on MSVC.

        * tao/SystemException.h:

          Removed declarations of typecodes and Any operators
          for the system exceptions.

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/NVList.h:

          Added include of the new AnyTypeCode_methods.h file below.

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/SystemExceptionA.cpp:

          Removed definition of static _tao_any_destructor()
          methods for system exceptions.

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/SystemExceptionA.h:

          New file, contains typecode and Any operator declarations
          for system exceptions.

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/AnyTypeCode_methods.h:

          New file, contains declarations of static CORBA is_nil()
          and release() methods for NamedValue and NVList. This
          move eliminated 'inconsistent dll linkage' warnings on
          MSVC.

        Thu Jul 28 22:40:26 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_decl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_context.h:

          Added logic to make the anyop export macro and export include
          default to the corresponding stub values, if any, when the
          former values have not been set on the command line, but -GA
          is used. This behavior will enable the *A.* files to be
          generated, but compiled into the same library as the stub
          files, if desired.

        Thu Jul 28 18:35:07 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Buffering_Constraint_Policy.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Messaging/Messaging_PolicyFactory.{h,cpp}:
          Moved the create method to extract a BufferingConstraint out of
          an Any to the Messaging lib. It is used there and not needed at
          all in the core TAO lib. In the future we probably will move the
          complete Buffering_Constraint_Policy to the Messaging lib

        Thu Jul 28 16:43:07 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

          Added code generation to include *A.h files (in the
          *A.cpp file) for each included IDL file. If possible,
          existence checks for these included files will be added
          at a future date.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_decl.cpp:

          Switched generation of the typecode declaration to the
          *A.h file, if the -GA option is used.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typecode/typecode_defn.cpp:

          Updated comment.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:

          Fixed typo in generated usage message.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:

          Added usage messages for each individual recognized
          -W[p|b] option.

        * docs/compiler.html:

          Updated command line option table with the new -Wb options
          for export macro and export include in *A.h files.

Wed Aug 17 11:30:37 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/NotifyLogFactory_i.cpp (create_with_id):

          reference.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.am:

          Regenerated.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DsLogAdmin.mpc:

          Add LogActivator.cpp to Source_Files in the DsLogAdmin_Serv

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/NotifyLogFactory_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/RTEventLogFactory_i.cpp:

          Changed create() and create_with_id() methods to invoke
          create_log_reference() instead of create_log_object().  This is
          not absolutely necessary, since a log is very likely to be used
          after it is created.  However, it helps to ensure the servant
          activator code path is exercised so it will work when a dynamic
          logging strategy that needs it is loaded.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/LogMgr_i.cpp

          Added USE_SERVANT_MANAGER request processing policy to the
          log POA.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/LogActivator.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/LogActivator.h:

          New files, servant activator class for creating new logs.  This
          is useful for persistent log strategies so that servants can be
          created when they are first accessed instead of at startup.

Tue Aug 16 18:19:13 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception/exception_ctor.cpp:

          Removed generation of the leading double colon for typedef'd
          basic type names in the exception constructor, since the
          ACE_NESTED_CLASS macro could be used, and the double colon
          will be incorrect for the VC6 expansion of the macro.

          base class.

          Added new create_repositoryid() virtual method to return
          the repository id for the specific log type.

Mon Aug 15 16:41:57 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

          Refactor separate create_log_object() implementations to

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/RTEventLogFactory_i.cpp:

          Create new virtual method create_log_servant() and factor out
          implementation from create_log_object().  This change enables
          making create_log_object() into a template method in the base
          class and using a Servant Activator to avoid creating the log
          servants until they're actually used.  I hope to make these
          changes soon.

          Changed to inherit from utils.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/LogMgr_i.cpp (init):

          Use TAO::Utils::PolicyList_Destroyer instead of plain
          CORBA::PolicyList and an explicit loop to destroy the policies.
          This ensures all policies will be destroyed if an exception is
          thrown.

          Fri Aug 12 22:13:15 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          slightly to omit the generation of the leading double colon
          if a field is a typedef of a basic type. In some of these
          cases, the ACE_NESTED_MACRO will be generated, and the
          leading double colon would be incorrect.

          IDL has a nested module named 'CORBA' there will be
          confusion otherwise. Thanks to Nikolay Metchev
          <n.metchev@teamphone.com> for sending in the example
          IDL file that uncovered the bug.

        * tests/Collocation_Tests/Hello.cpp:

          Added a sleep of 1 second before the orb shutdown to avoid

        * tests/OBV/Collocated/Forward/run_test.pl:

          Changed this test to use if statements instead of ACE_ASSERT so

          builds.

        * tests/Portable_Interceptors/Collocated/Dynamic/run_test.pl:

          Check the correct variable to accurately display the test result.

          Added a sleep of 1 second before the orb shutdown to avoid
          BAD_INV_ORDER exceptions on fast dual processor machines.

        * tests/Server_Connection_Purging/client.cpp:

          Remove event handlers after finishing with the reactor loop to
          avoid the possibility of using the handlers after they go out of
          scope.  Also, added a parameter to an ACE_ERROR_RETURN that
          expected one (by %p).

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/Echo.h:

          Make the abort_counter_ to be atomic. This would resolve the

        * tests/Bug_1361_Regression/run_test.pl:

          Made it wait longer for server shutdown since the server shutdown
          needs more time on some platforms and corrected one syntex error
          which uses undefined $client1.

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/server.cpp:

          Cleaned up some poor usage of ACE exception macros in client
          and server.  Added a short sleep in client after it invokes
          shutdown on server to make sure the request is written (this was
          causing a problem on Windows XP).

        * tests/Smart_Proxies/Policy/run_test.pl:

          Fixed return-code checking.

          Reverted Mon Dec  6 23:08:12 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        The code requires use of to_name() to support creation of CosNaming::Name with
        length > 1. For example :
               CosNaming::Name_var n = to_name("a/b");
          is basically equivalent to :
               CosNaming::Name n(2);
               n.length(2);
               n[0].id = "a";
               n[1].id = "b";

          Thanks to Mike Chartier <mikec at compgen dot com> for
        spotting this problem.
        Rather than reverting the code to support both styles, I just made
        the new code always use to_name().

        * tao/orbconf.h:

             "corbaname:rir"
          which should produce the object reference of the naming service.

          Equivalence of two TypeCodes must be done between their
          unaliased counterparts.  The code was incorrectly leaving one of
          the TypeCodes aliased in the comparison.

        * tao/Strategies/advanced_resource.cpp:
          Added include of tao/Protocol_Factory.h to not get compile errors
          when all protocols are disabled. Thanks to Arvind S. Krishna
          <arvindk at dre dot vanderbilt dot edu> for reporting this

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_i.cpp:
          Fixed invalid delete

        * tao/PortableServer/Servant_Base.cpp:
          Fixed bug when invoking collocated oneways with SYNC_WITH_SERVER
          is set

        * tests/Collocation_Oneway_Tests/*:
          New test for collocated oneways. Thanks to Vito Bico
          <vbica at qualcomm dot com> for making this test to reproduce
          the bug in Servant_Base.

        * tests/Collocation_Exception_Test/*:
          New test for testing exceptions in collocated case

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Removed TAO libraries, MPC now handles this.

        * tests/Hello/Hello.mpc:
          Added -St and -Sa as idl flags. This test doesn't need Any
          and TypeCode and this way we can get the footprint down more
          when AnyTypeCode refactoring is ready.
