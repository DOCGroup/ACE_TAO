This directory contains ACE- and TAO-specific extensions of MPC.  All
the base projects in the config directory are ACE- and TAO-specific,
along with the perl modules for the gnuace and borland types and the
templates that go along with those implementations.

The default workspace and project type for ACE_wrappers/bin/mwc.pl and
ACE_wrappers/bin/mpc.pl is gnuace.  This differs from the default for
mwc.pl and mpc.pl located in the MPC directory.

GNUACE-specific aspects of project keywords
-------------------------------------------

requires        Specifies which features should be enabled in order to
                generate the project file.  Under the GNUACE type, it also
                specifies which tao macros should be set to build the
                target.

avoids          Specifies which features should be disabled in order to
                generate the project file.  Under the GNUACE type, it also
                specifies which tao macros should not be set to build the
                target.

The following keywords are GNUACE only:

tagname         Specifies the make macro to check before building the target
tagchecks       Specifies the values for tagname to check

NOTE: Within the GNUACE project type, setting sharedname to empty and
setting staticname to the static library name will result in a project
that will generate only static libraries.

The default generation mode for the GNUACE project type is named targets.
The environment variable MPC_GNUACE_DIRECTORY_DEPS can be set to get the
directory based build that was used up until April of 2006.

For more information about MPC, see the README and USAGE files in the
MPC directory.

You can get MPC using cvs.  If you have access to the DOC Group CVS
repository, you can check-out the 'MPC' module.  You can also
anonymously check-out MPC from OCI's anonymous CVS server.

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.ociweb.com:/cvs co MPC
