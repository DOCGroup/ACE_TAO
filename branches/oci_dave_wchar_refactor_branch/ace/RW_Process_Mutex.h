 * @class ACE_RW_Process_Mutex
 *
 * @brief Wrapper for readers/writer locks that exist across processes.
 *
 * Note that because this class uses the
 * <ACE_File_Lock> as its implementation it only can be reliably
 * used between separate processes, rather than threads in the
 * same process.  This isn't a limitation of ACE, it's simply
 * the file lock semantics on UNIX and Win32.
 * \todo For systems with pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared one
 * may consider using them to make the mutex faster.
