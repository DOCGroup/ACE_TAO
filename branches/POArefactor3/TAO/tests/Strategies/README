	This test helps show the various ways in which the default and
advanced TAO Strategies can be dynamically loaded. 

The default TAO strategies are defined in tao/default_resource.cpp and
the advanced TAO strategies are defined in
tao/Strategies/advanced_resource.cpp. 

	The advanced TAO strategies can be loaded dynamically or
statically linked. To load these strategies dynamically, we need to
use the service configurator files. But, if we need to link them
statically, we need to link the library and include the header file.

	This test shows a simple case where in only the default
strategies are used. It also shows the advanced case where in the
advanced strategies are used. 

	The test can be run using the perl script available or
manually.
