  <title>Notification Service Monitor</title>
  <!-- $Id$ -->
</head>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The notification service monitor adds monitoring capabilities to the TAO
Notification Service so that potential problems can be detected in time to
take remedial action.
</p>
<p>
The monitoring and control capability is enabled and configured
via a service configuration directive.  The impact on normal operation of
the Notification Service should be minimized whether or not Monitoring
and Control is configured.
</p>
<h2>Using the Notification Service Monitor</h2>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
The monitor is enabled via the Service Configurator.  The following
Service Configurator commands will enable the monitor:</p>
<pre>
  dynamic TAO_MonitorAndControl Service_Object * TAO_CosNotification_MC:_make_TAO_MonitorAndControl () ""
  dynamic TAO_MC_Notify_Service Service_Object * TAO_CosNotification_MC_Ext:_make_TAO_MC_Notify_Service () ""
</pre>
<p>
When the notification service is initialized, the monitor will start up in
it's own thread (using it's own ORB) and work in conjunction with the
notification service to provide statistics through an IDL interface.
</p>
<p>
The TAO_MonitorAndControl object accepts the following options:</p>
<table border=1 summary="TAO_MonitorAndControl configuration options">
  <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-NoNameSvc</td>
    <td>Instructs the monitor not to register itself with the Name Service.
        Otherwise, it will be registered as TAO_MonitorAndControl.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-ORBArg &lt;parameter&gt;</td>
    <td>Passes &lt;parameter&gt; to the monitor's ORB upon initialization.
        There is no limit to the number of times this argument can be
        provided.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-o &lt;file&gt;</td>
    <td>Write the IOR of the monitor out to &lt;file&gt;.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Obtaining a reference to the Monitor</h3>
<p>
The object reference to the Notification Service Monitor can be obtained
one of following ways (depending upon the options passed upon configuration
of the monitor):</p>
<ul>
  <li>CORBA::Object_var obj = orb->string_to_object ("corbaloc:iiop:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/TAO_MonitorAndControl");</li>
  <li>CORBA::Object_var obj = orb->string_to_object ("corbaname:iiop:&lt;nshost&gt;:&lt;nsport&gt;#TAO_MonitorAndControl");</li>
  <li>CORBA::Object_var obj = orb->string_to_object ("file://&lt;path to IOR file&gt;");</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retrieving statistics from the Monitor</h3>
<p>
The IDL interface provides a set of methods to obtain statistic names as
well as to obtain the statistics themselves.
</p>
<p>
Numeric data is stored in a structure with the following definition:
</p>
<pre>
  struct Numeric
  {
    /// The number of samples currently taken into account
    unsigned long count;

    /// The average of the accumulated samples.
    double average;

    /// The sum of the squares of the samples.
    double sum_of_squares;

    /// The minimum sample value recorded
    double minimum;

    /// The maximum sample value recorded
    double maximum;

    /// The last sample value recored
    double last;
  };
</pre>

<p>Text lists are stored in a sequence of strings known as NameList.</p>
<p>These types may be returned as part of a Union depending on the
method.  The Data union has the following definition:</p>
<pre>
  enum DataType { DATA_NUMERIC, DATA_TEXT };
  union Data switch (DataType) {
    case DATA_NUMERIC: Numeric num;
    case DATA_TEXT: NameList list;
  };
</pre>
<p>The <b>get_statistic_names()</b> method returns a <b>NameList</b> which
contains the names that are currently known by the statistic monitor. 
This list will change over time.</p>
<p>The <b>get_statistic(in string name)</b> returns a <b>Data</b> union which
contains either a <b>Numeric</b> object or a <b>NameList</b>, depending upon
the type of statistic associated with the provided name.  If the name does
not correspond to a known statistic, the <b>InvalidName</b> exception will be
thrown.
</p>
<p> The <b>get_statistics(in NameList names)</b> returns a
<b>DataList</b>, which is a sequence of <b>Data</b>.  The order of the
<b>DataList</b> is the same order as provided within the <b>NameList</b>. 
If any one name provided within the list does not correspond to a known
statistic, the <b>InvalidName</b> exception will be thrown.
</p>
<p>The <b>clear_statistics(in NameList names)</b> method clears all
accumulated statistic data for the provided names.  If any one name
provided within the list does not correspond to a known statistic, the
<b>InvalidName</b> exception will be thrown.
</p>
<p>The <b>get_and_clear_statistics(in NameList names)</b> method is a
combination of <b>get_statistics()</b> and <b>clear_statistics()</b>.
</p>
<h3>Affecting the Notification Service with the Monitor</h3>
<p>The <b>shutdown_event_channel(in string name)</b>.  If the name does
not correspond to an event channel, the <b>InvalidName</b> exception will be
thrown.
