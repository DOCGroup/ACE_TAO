          In handle_events(), if returning -1 because the reactor isn't
          ready to handle events, also set errno to ESHUTDOWN to tell the
          caller why. Fixes Bugzilla #3974.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Added command settings for
          preprocessing C and C++ source files.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Added rules to preprocess
          C and C++ files when directed.
        
          These allow one to now quickly produce a preprocessed version of
          a source file. Ala... make -f GNUmakefile.ACE ACE.i
          would preprocess ACE.cpp and put the result in ACE.i.

Fri Apr 29 14:01:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc: For Message_Queue_Test add -bmaxdata:0x20000000 to
          linker options to extend the available data space at run time.
          Avoids the heap smashing the stacks.

Fri Apr 22 15:19:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Add support for XL C++ 11.

        * ace/config-aix-7.h: New config for AIX 7.

Mon Feb 28 20:29:59 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Event_Analyzer.cpp:
        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/Event_Analyzer.cpp: Replaced the
          name "mod_name" with "module_name" to avoid a clash with macro
          defined in /usr/include/sys/stropts.h encountered when optimized
          build was done.

Mon Feb 28 18:10:19 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Remove the -qfuncsect
          option from CCFLAGS; it caused an occasional odd problem and the
          only reason it was added (Jul 17 2002) was to try and remove
          duplicate symbol diagnostics from template instantiations.
          Thanks to Phil Mesnier for raising this issue and identifying
          the fix.

Tue Feb  1 14:28:18 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.cpp (operator+=): Add a temporary for the return
          value to quiet an IBM XL C++ 10 optimizer warning about returning
          the address of a temporary. No, I'm not kidding.

Wed Jan 26 20:17:28 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: If XL C/C++ 10.1 is used,
          use the same compiler options as for XL C/C++ 9.

Fri Jan 21 17:04:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Set ACE_LACKS_(STR|WCS)TO[U]LL when
          the requisite long-long compiler settings are missing. Enables
          use of these functions when they're available.

        * m4/ace_func.m4: Remove the parts of ACE_FUNC_WCSTOLL and
          ACE_FUNC_WCSTOULL that set ACE_LACKS_*_PROTOTYPE. The use of
          the ACE_LACKS_*_PROTOTYPE was removed from ACE code in
          Thu Jan 20 11:42:53 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>
          plus, it's wrong. The functions (at least on HP-UX, which seems
          to center on the issue here) are available when needed via a
          #pragma extern, which effectively inlines the code from the
          compiler. Adding a prototype is the wrong thing to do in this
          case.

        * m4/compiler.m4: Add -ext to aCC's options. Turns on long-long.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Remove all the specific
          macro setting to try and select particular threading features and
          Rogue Wave libs. Use -mt and be done with it. -mt does the right
          thing wrt RW and preprocessor feature macros based on the -AA/-AP
          options. Also add -ext to turn on long-long.

Fri Jan 21 00:15:19 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acemfcexe.mpb: New base project

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.ico:
        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.rc:
        * tests/ACE_Init_Test_Resource.h: Modernized resource defs to let
          ACE_Init_Test build and run properly.

        * tests/tests.mpc: Added the rest of the needed files for ACE_Init_Test
          and made it require mfc; base it off acemfcexe (new, above).

Mon Jan 17 20:47:01 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.cpp (handle_accept): If the new handler has
          already set its own proactor pointer, don't reset it. Fixes
          Bugzilla #3947.

Wed Jan  5 23:10:05 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Bug_2610_Regression_Test.cpp: Fixed a bunch of ACE_ERROR
          statements to log the actual error cause; also fixed for IPv6.

Wed Dec 29 20:11:11 EST 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Sun Nov  7 00:13:13 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.cpp: Mismatching the addr->name test is not
          necessarily an error.

Fri Nov  5 14:23:26 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Added a hook for users to
          include site-private rules in a build. If the user places a
          "rules.private.GNU" in any build directory it will get included
          from rules.local.GNU. The "private_rules_file" make variable
          can be set to override the name and/or location of the file.
          If no such rules file exists, its absence is silently ignored.
          This facility can be used, for example, to integrate a specialized
          code checker into the build process.

Thu Nov  4 15:17:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): For platforms that have the GNU-extended
          gethostbyname2_r() function, use it instead of getaddrinfo() for
          a IPv6 hostname lookup. Customer reports that it getaddrinfo() is
          hugely slower than gethostbyname2 on large vlans. The alternate
          code is used if ACE_HAS_GETHOSTBYNAME2 is set in config.h.
          (This is a revised fix from Tue Nov  2 00:18:34 UTC 2010)

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.cpp: Add some IPv6 address and name lookups.

Tue Nov  2 01:25:05 UTC 2010  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (ACE_Log_Msg::log): Added

          ACE_OS::memset(format,'\0',128);

          to ensure the format string has known values.  Thanks to Chad
          Beaulac <chad dot beaulac at objectivesolutions dot com> for
          this suggestion.  This fixes bugid 3923.

Tue Nov  2 00:18:34 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Thu Oct 28 17:45:10 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): Corrected ACE_HAS_IPV6 checks made in
          Wed Oct 27 22:16:12 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>.

Wed Oct 27 22:16:12 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): When looking up a hostname, always use
          gethostbyname() for IPv4 requests, even if IPv6 is available.
          getaddrinfo() (used when IPv4 and 6 are both available) is hugely
          slower than gethostbyname() in large vlan environments. Note that
          even though gethostbyname() can grok IPv6 on Linux, it can't
          anywhere else, so I avoided trying to go that route.

Wed Oct 20 16:07:09 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp (ACE_Thread_Timer_Queue_Adapter::svc):
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp (expire):
          Temporarily release and reacquire the mutex around timer dispatch.
          This prevents a deadlock on user code with multiple threads doing
          timer-related operations.

          Wed Sep  1 19:31:24 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          They caused other problems with existing usage. The referenced
          TAO test behind the problems needs to be fixed, not ACE.

Wed Sep  1 19:31:24 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (handle_ready): Changed the timeout behavior to just
          return 0, no errno, as ACE_OS::poll() and ACE_OS::select() both do.
          This restores historic behavior changed inadvertently at
          Fri Aug 27 19:17:11 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp:
        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Test.cpp: Re-added the if/switch on return value from
          ACE::handle_read|write_ready() to detect timeout and set errno
          here.

          These changes were necessary to fix the TAO faults test. Thanks
          to Johnny and Simon for narrowing down the cause and testing
          the fix.

        * ace/FIFO.h:
        * ace/FIFO_Recv.h:
        * ace/FIFO_Send.h: Clarified initialization and open behavior.

Fri Aug 27 19:17:11 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (handle_ready, handle_timed_complete,
                       handle_timed_accept): On platforms where poll() is
          available, prefer that to using select() for checking a single
          handle's state and/or waiting for a condition. This preference
          was previously only used if ACE_HAS_LIMITED_SELECT was set. The
          ACE_HAS_LIMITED_SELECT choice is removed, making ACE_HAS_POLL the
          setting that switches this preference. The driving reason for this
          is that if select() is called to detect changes on a handle whose
          values falls outside that which can safely be stored in an fdset,
          the handle-setting macros/functions will set/clear bits outside
          of the fdset. This results in very weird memory changes, often in
          the stack, which are very hard to diagnose. poll()'s operation
          does not suffer from this affect. With the growing use of large
          numbers of handles and use of ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor on Linux,
          the rate at which this problem was cropping up was increasing.
          Thanks to Olivier Langlois for diagnosing this problem and
          proposing the patch.
        
          (handle_ready): Properly set the poll condition for read and/or
          write. Thanks to kumaran.prem@gmail.com for this fix.

        * ace/Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Test.cpp: Replaced use of ACE_OS::select() with
          ACE::handle_ready() and friends.

        This all resolves Bugzilla #3606.

Fri Aug 27 15:01:41 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Connector.{h cpp} (ACE_NonBlocking_Connect_Handler): Add a
          handle_close() which calls handle_input() if called by the
          ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor to remove a failed connect. Apparently,
          Linux epoll, at least sometimes, signals EPOLLERR on a failed
          nonblocking connect, unlike the select() case which selects the
          failed fd for read. Thanks to Kannan Ramaswamy <kannan dot
          ramaswamy at cogcap dot com> for this information and fix.

Wed Aug 25 19:58:19 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h cpp}: Regarding change number 2 at
          Fri Mar 26 14:07:55 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          dispatching notifies in only one thread at a time was 1) wrong
          (TP_Reactor doesn't do this), 2) broke important existing
          applications at a customer site. This has been fixed so that the
          notify dispatch behavior is like ACE_TP_Reactor: when the
          notify handle is signaled, extract one notification, release
          the token, dispatch the notification. Thus, each thread will
          dispatch one notification, and multiple threads can dispatch
          them at the same time if there are multiples.

          Also fixed an error where it was possible to lose notice of a
          notification. Resolves Bugzilla #3328.

Thu Jul 29 14:41:32 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.h (set_handles): Clarify that passing ACE_INVALID_HANDLE
          for any of the handle values will cause a duplicate of the
          corresponding ACE_STDIN/OUT/ERR to be used in the options.

Mon Jul 26 20:26:53 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h: Note that the cpu_set_size to the get/set
          affinity methods is a byte count.

Thu Jul 15 17:53:47 UTC 2010  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
        * THANKS:
        
          Restore pre-gestalt behavior of returning -1 if svc.conf does
          not exist and an ACE_Service_Config::open() is expecting to use
          the default file.

          Thanks to Daynesh Mangal (daynesh@gmail.com) for reporting the
          errant behavior.

Thu Jun 24 02:07:18 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.inl (open): Allow the command line options to
          override the passed ignore_static_svcs argument. Restores correct
          operation, fixing Bugzilla #3865.

Wed Jun 23 14:17:26 UTC 2010  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:

Wed Jun 23 10:24:30 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          Added default setting (0) for new feature 'old_stdstream'.
          Defines that platform has 'old' std C++ stream classes not
          compatible with f.i. the INet lib.

Wed Jun 23 03:21:01 UTC 2010  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb (project):

          Added a clause to turn off certain macros and libraries in cdt6
          project generation when threads are not used.

Tue Jun 22 07:47:30 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * protocols/ace/INet/String_IOStream.cpp:
        * protocols/ace/INet/String_IOStream.h:
          Const change:

          Standardized include statements.
          Added some (it's a start!) documentation.

        * protocols/ace/INet/inet.mpc:
          Added ACE_ROOT/protocols to includes.

Fri Jun 18 20:32:54 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp: Disable error logging around the
          load of ACE_Logging_Strategy else there are errors logged while
          hunting for the proper name form, confusing the scoreboard output.

Fri Jun 18 19:58:55 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp: Moved the _get_dll_unload_policy()
          function from DLL_Manager.cpp to Logging_Strategy.cpp where it's
          more clear why it's there.

Fri Jun 18 11:13:40 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl: Fixed fuzz errors.

Thu Jun 17 21:59:34 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.{h inl}: Added explicit set_ and get_ methods for
          ACE_UINT64 msec values. Also marked the existing "getter"
          msec(ACE_UINT64&) methods deprecated because they look like
          setter methods and are confusing. Users should change to get_msec().
          Resolves Bugzilla #3336.

        * NEWS: Described the new methods and rationale.

        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp: Added test cases for the new
          set_msec() and get_msec() methods.

Thu Jun 17 19:47:58 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp: Add _get_dll_unload_policy() function that
          returns ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY_LAZY; this prevents the DLL_Manager
          from running down ACE framework components just from unloading
          a service contained in ACE itself.
          Proposed fix for Bugzilla #3856.

Thu Jun 17 19:01:32 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp: Added a new test case,
          testUnloadingACELoggingStrategy. It loads then unloads the
          ACE logging strategy. This causes ACE to run down itself,
          smashing singletons in the process. This test case goes with
          Bugzilla #3856.

Wed Jun 16 21:48:49 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added various assignments that are specific to -type cdt6.  Since
          this Eclipse CDT support is not yet available in MPC, these will
          be ignored for now.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Changes to support building on Windows (MinGW) without a bash shell.
          Set SHELL=cmd in platform_macros.GNU to enable.

Wed Jun 16 09:09:30 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * protocols/ace/INet/ConnectionCache.cpp:
          Added some error logging.

Mon Jun 14 16:16:30 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * protocols/ace/INet/inet.mpc:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/inet.mpb:
          Avoid WinCE.

Mon Jun 14 14:16:35 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Adjusted the VMS compatibility work-around from
          Wed Jun  9 14:45:33 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          so that it excludes more GNU make constructs that the version
          on VMS can't handle.

Mon Jun 14 10:06:31 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * html/Stats/index.shtml:
          Updated Xampler links, one for PS3, one for IBM Cell

Mon Jun 14 09:13:30 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * protocols/ace/INet/URLBase.h:
          Fixed single thread compile problem.

Sun Jun 13 18:14:13 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec:
          Integrated following changes from David Ward <dpward at mit dot edu>
          Updates the RPM SPEC file to fix the build on several platforms,
          and to otherwise clean it up:
          - Depend on redhat-rpm-config to fix BuildArch under Fedora
          - Depend on elfutils to allow build of debuginfo package under RHEL 4
          - Replace %{?fedora_version} with %{?fedora} and %{?mandriva_version}
            with %{?mdkversion} [1]
          - Replace %{defined ...} with 0%{?...} and %{undefined ...}
            with 0%{!?...} for portability [1]
          - Move mwc (and autoconf/configure) step from %prep to %build [2]
          - For _with_autoconf: Perform configure in $ACE_ROOT/objdir as
            suggested by configure, to keep the build underneath $ACE_ROOT
          - For _with_autoconf: Pass additional options to configure, to install
            files in the correct location (i.e. /usr/lib64 rather than
            /usr/lib in 64-bit multilib environments)
          - Update "default values" comment at top of file to reflect the
            actual default values.
          - Remove leftover comments (i.e. references to _with_guilibs)

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec-bugfixonly.patch:
        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec-release.patch:
          Patch files to also ship latest major and minor release from
          opensuse build service

        * protocols/ace/HTBP/HTBP_Session.cpp:

          Performance testing shows severe latency due to not using
          TCP_NODELAY on the underlying sockets.

Wed Jun  9 18:45:38 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Wed Jun  9 15:41:11 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * protocols/ace/INet/inet.mpc:

          The Template_Files section is needed for "make install".

Wed Jun  9 14:45:33 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Adding a compatibility flag for VMS (vms_old_make) as an MPC
          template variable.  The GNU make version on VMS is old
          and possibly buggy.

          Fixes for wchar on Unix.  There is no ACE_OS::getenv(wchar_t*) on
          Unix, it's only on Win32.

Tue Jun  8 21:59:16 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:

          Use the "EXE_SUBDIR" property of the TestTarget object (Process_Win32
          already has this behavior).

        * bin/PerlACE/TestTarget.pm:

          Supporting setting the "ARCH" property on a per-TestTarget basis.
          Added a GetArchDir() method to the TestTarget object.

Tue Jun  8 14:25:56 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * protocols/ace/INet/inet.mpc:

          Install the export header.

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:

          With similar changes as the previous commit, this test can also be
          run for ARCH builds.

Mon Jun  7 21:39:54 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * protocols/ace/INet/inet.mpc:

          Added the install_dir setting so that headers are installed to
          the correct directory.

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:

          New function GetArchDir() for use when a test script needs to
          know the ARCH directory for a given path.  This is only needed when
          the test passes the full path to an executable as a command-line
          argument to a different executable (used in CIAO).

          If we're using ARCH, set an environment variable ACE_EXE_SUB_DIR so
          that the individual tests can find executables and shared libraries.

          Echo back the ln or cp command used for symlinking/copying the

          This takes the place of the old "Installing..." messages which are

        * tests/Dev_Poll_Reactor_Test.cpp:
          Fixed 2 memory leaks in this test. Previously both client and
          server svc handlers were leaked. After fixing that it turned out
          that client is not able to finish properly as its reactor is not
          shutdown. The later was happening because server was reaching
          desired exit condition faster and once it get closed client could
          never get a chance to reach its own exit condition. So, in short,
          there is no point in this test to run client side reactor if the
          client's svc handler got closed.

          Custom_Handler wasn't a template so removed
          all template declarations. This should resolve
          the static link issues on the scoreboard.

Wed May  5 16:17:15 UTC 2010  Chad Beaulac <chad@objectivesolutions.com>

        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:
          Setting type_ to 0 in ACE_Service_Type::fini after call to
          type_->fini ()
          This allows us to check for the value 0 in the double
          loop inside ASR::fini

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:
          Checking for  s->type () != 0 inside ASR::fini
          This ensures we don't access ACE_Service_Type instances that
          have been fini'd already.

          This resolves Bugzilla #3847

Tue May  4 21:23:44 UTC 2010  Chad Beaulac <chad@objectivesolutions.com>

        * ace/Stream.cpp:
          Added debug and warning logging in ACE_Stream::remove

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:
          One of problems is that ACE_Module_Type::name gets its
          value from the svc.conf file. The ACE_Module that it references
          gets its name from the static factory method used to create the
          module. When the names don't match the call to ACE_Stream_Type::fini
          fails to remove any ACE_Modules from the underlying ACE_Stream.
          Since none of the ACE_Modules are removed, ACE_Module_Type::fini
          tries to call fini on the ACE_Module reader and writer ACE_Task
          instances. And they've already been deleted by ACE_Stream::close
          called from ACE_Stream_Type::fini.

          Reassigned ACE_Module::name in ACE_Module_Type::init to
          ACE_Module_Type::name and fixed the SEGV at shutdown because of the
          issue described above.

          All of these issues are related: #3334 #3205 #2916 #3847

          All these tests need to block SIGPIPE signal. POSIX defines that
          newly created threads must inherit signal mask from the creating
          thread. The later doesn't happen at least on Solaris 10. With this
          change each new thread in the above tests will block SIGPIPE signal
          individually.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:
          Modified ASR::fini to print debug info for empty

          This fixes the ASR remove functionality that was
          one of the reasons SC_Server was crashing at shutdown.

       This fixes Bugzilla #2916 and #3205.
       I'll create another patch for #3334 after this commit.

Mon Apr 19 12:44:56 UTC 2010 Chad Beaulac <chad@objectivesolutions.com>

        * ace/Service_Types.h
        * ace/Service_Types.inl
        * ace/Service_Types.cpp
          Added service_type_ attr to expose the type of service being
          managed to the ACE_Service_Repository. This allows the ASR to
          manage the lifecycle of the ACE_Module and ACE_Stream in order to
          avoid a double delete of ACE_Module at shutdown.

          ACE_Stream_Type::fini was modified to not call ACE_Module_Type::fini
          as this will results in a double delete when ACE_Service_Repository::fini
          is called. ACE_Stream_Type::remove(module_name) was modified to not call
          ACE_Module_Type::fini as this will results in a double delete
          when ACE_Service_Repository::fini is called also.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp
          Modified ASR::fini to iterate over the service_array_ twice.
          ACE_Service_Type::fini is called on all ACE_Stream_Type and
          ACE_Service_Object_Type instances first. Then, fini is called on
          all ACE_Modules_Type instances. All calls to fini are done in the
          order the services appear in the ASR::service_array_ except for
          the grouping described here. The calls to ACE_Module_Type::fini
          must be done last because ACE_Stream_Type::fini accesses the Modules
          so they must not be deleted by a call to ACE_Module_Type::fini
          before that.

        * tests/Bug_3334_Regresssion_Test.cpp
          Added call to ACE_Service_Repository::fini_svcs() to capture all
          debug output before the application exits.

        * tests/run_tests.lst
          Removed !FIXED_BUGS_ONLY from Bug_3334_Regression_Test

        This fixes Bugzilla #3334

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h inl cpp}: Refinements to the way notifies
          are handled:
            1. The notify handler was being dispatched multiple times per
               notify; this has been fixed, which increases performance.
            2. Notifications are now dispatched in only one thread at a time.
               This brings more parity to the way notifies are handled in
               other reactor implementations.

Wed Mar 17 11:58:10 UTC 2010  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        Committed the changes that I had to revert before x.7.7.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
          Changed the code so that close() is called in case of failure
          instead of destroy().

        * ace/Connector.cpp:
        * ace/Connector.h:
          Changed the fix for bug#3731. Now NBCH adds a reference in
          constructor and removes it in destructor if the SVC_HANDLER that
          it owns is reference counted. This is a cleaner solution than the
          one used before.

        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/run_test.lst:

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Extended doxygen documentaion related to the order of processing
          of command-line directives and service configuration files.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
          Changed the order of processing. First, service configuration files
          are processed then command-line directive. This way default svc.conf
          can not override results of user provided command-line directives.

        * NEWS:
          Added a news entry for this change.

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp
        * ace/High_Res_Timer.h
        * ace/High_Res_Timer.inl
          Use 64bit calculations to increase our precision. If you want to have the 32bit
          calculations, add ACE_USE_WINDOWS_32BIT_HIGH_RES_TIMER_CALCULATIONS as define. If
          the scoreboard doesn't show any platforms requiring 32bit, we will remove that code
          before the next micro release goes out
          Thanks to Alon Diamant <diamant dot alon at gmail dot com> for supplying the patches.
          This fixes bugzilla 3703.

        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Unix.pm:

          Added an option to use the 'expect' program to interact with
          the remote target (via telnet).  This is only enabled when the
          environment variable ACE_RUN_VX_USE_EXPECT is defined.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:

          Updated the ACE_VXWORKS version check to include version 6.8.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Added !VxWorks to exclude Pipe_Test which can't be run
          on VxWorks (kernel mode) because it depends on ACE_Process::spawn().

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          PPU 4.1.1 for PPC doesn't have atomic builtin support
          for datatypes of size 1 and 2

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Some platforms have been reported to return undef from
          $FindBin::RealBin.  In this case, fall back on dirname($0).

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          Added specializations for bool/unsigned short/short, is around 7 times
          faster than the default atomic op

Mon Mar  8 08:24:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configure.ac:
          Added test for GCC builtin support

Fri Mar  5 12:40:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          We did a benchmark on a FC10 64bit system with the GCC builtin support
          for long/unsigned long. In a release/inline build the performance
          results using the GCC builtin support is around 2 times faster than
          when using the ACE assembly version. When we have the GCC builtin support,
          we now also going to use that for long/unsigned long.

Fri Mar  5 12:20:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.cpp:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.inl:
          Added new Atomic template for the GCC builtin atomic op support.
          This is used on PPC64/PPC32/IA64 for int/unsigned int/long/unsigned long.
          On EM64T we do use this for int/unsigned int, the ACE assembly version for
          long/unsigned long is faster than the GCC.

          On FC10 64bit the int/unsigned int Atomic_Op is now around 6 to 7 times
          faster than before this change

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          Enable the new builtin atomic also for EM64T

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added new files

Fri Mar  5 11:30:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Print the number of iterations

Fri Mar  5 11:28:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Also measure postfix increment/decrement

Fri Mar  5 11:21:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Added more checks to make sure Atomic_Op does work

Tue Mar  2 21:02:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (mask_ops_i): If the specified handle is
          not registered, return -1 instead of crashing.

Thu Mar  4 09:15:54 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Fix for problems with creating MPC release tag.

Thu Mar  4 07:50:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Rewritten this test to use a template method so that we can
          test atomic op easily for various data types

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:
          Layout changes and fixed compile problem with CB2010. This fixes
          bugzilla 3835, thanks to Jan Kalin <jan dot kalin at zag dot si>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          CB also has long timevalue mismatch

Thu Mar  4 07:50:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * NEWS:
          Updated for next micro

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec:
          Fixed problem with installation of nslist readme

        * etc/index.html:
          Added 5.7.7

        * docs/Download.html:
          Updated for 5.7.7

        * docs/bczar/bczar.html:
          Several updates because we now package on a FC12 system

        * debianbuild/rules:
          Removed commented out part

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Next micro release will not ship msvc71 solutions, it is still
          supported but the end user should generate the solutions him self.
          Also WinCE solutions are not generated anymore for CIAO and the
          autoconf bootstrapping is done much earlier in the release process
          so when it fails we know early. The hostname check has been removed

        * bin/diff-builds-and-group-fixed-tests-only.sh:
          Updated because of micro release
