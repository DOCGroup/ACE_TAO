For detailed explanation of static configuration, please see
$CIAO_ROOT/docs/static_ciao.html.

To run the static configurator, 

>Static_Assembly_Parser -a <.cad file>

This will generate three files -

Static_CCM_App.cpp - this file contains the main program which
instantiates the component server and invokes the static configuration
engine to create containers, homes, etc.

Static_CCM_App.mpc - this file contains the necessary files for
building the static application. You have to manually change this file
so as to include files that are not known to the static configurator.

Static_Assembly_Config.h - this file contains the C++ intermediate
representation of all the information in the .cad, .csd and .ssd XML
files.
