<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Options for TAO Components</H3>

<H3>Overview</H3>

TAO is an extremely flexible ORB that can be configured to meet a wide
range of application requirements.  There are two primary mechanisms
for configuring TAO's behaviors:

<UL>

<LI> Configurations that are global to an ORB, such as
    a Name Service IOR or the default stringified IOR
    format an ORB generates, are configured via environment
    variables or command-line option flags passed to the
    <code>ORB_init()</code> call.  The internal structure for
    command-line options is the traditional
    <CODE>argc</CODE>/<CODE>argv</CODE> vector of strings style
    popularized by C/C++ and Unix.  By convention,
    <code>ORB_init()</code> will consume any options that it recognizes,
    removing them from <CODE>argv</CODE>, whereas unrecognized options
    will not be removed. <P>

<LI>Users can also modify the internal behaviors of an ORB by
    dynamically linking <EM>ORB plug-ins</EM>, such as client/server connection 
    strategies, via a <code>svc.conf</code> file.  These ORB plug-ins
    can be fine-tuned by specifying their options in the
    <code>svc.conf</code> file.
    TAO provides several default plug-ins to deploy resource management
    strategies, client/server strategies, and communication protocols
    that can be further customized via the
    <code>svc.conf</code> file options described in this page.  Advanced
    users can also develop their own plug-ins to customize TAO.
    A <code>svc.conf</code> file, however, is not required to run TAO
    programs since TAO provides a set of built-in strategies configured for
    use with common use cases.  Many of the default configuratiions for
    these built-in strategies can also be customized when TAO is
    compiled.<p>

        where <CODE>V.v</CODE> and <CODE>W.w</CODE> are optional protcol versions for

        object implementation that respects POA's current state and
        policies.   When using the <em>direct</em> strategy, method
        invocations on collocated objects become direct calls to servant
        without checking POA's status (which translates to better
        performance.)  Notice that the interfaces that you wish to use
        direct collocation with must be compiled with <code>

        mechanism by the resolve_initial_references () method. The mappings
        specified through this argument override the orb-install-time

    <TD><CODE>-ORBSingleReadOptimization</CODE> <EM>boolean (0|1)</EM></TD>

    <TD><A name=-ORBSingleReadOptimization></A>This option controls
    single read optimzations when reading requests.  If this option is
    off, the ORB will do two reads to read a request.  One to read the
    request header and the other to read the request payload.  If this
    option is on, the ORB will do a read of size
    <EM>TAO_MAXBUFSIZE</EM>, hoping to read the entire request.
    However, in this case, there is a chance of reading more than one
    request.  If any additional requests have been read, they are
    queued up for processing later.<p>

    This option defaults to <EM>1</EM> because it can provide better
    performance since one less read is performed.  However, in the
    case of RT-CORBA, this option should be set to <EM>0</EM>.
    Consider the following scenario: two requests are read from one
    socket; the additional request is queued; a Reactor notify is
    dispatch to awake a follower threads; at this time, new requests
    arrive on others sockets of higher priority; however, since
    notifies are given preferences over normal I/O, the lower priority
    queued message will be processed before the newly arrived higher
    priority request.

  <TD><a name="-ORBFlushingStrategy"></a>
      By default TAO provides three strategies to flush queued
      messages.
      The <CODE>leader_follower</CODE> strategy uses the Reactor and
      non-blocking I/O to send the outgoing messages,
      this strategy participates in the Leader/Followers protocol to
      synchronize access to the Reactor.
      The <CODE>reactive</CODE> strategy uses the Reactor but does not
      take part in the Leader/Followers
      protocol, thus it is better used only
      in single threaded applications.
      Finally, the <CODE>blocking</CODE> strategy flushes the
      queue as soon as it becomes "full", and blocks the
      thread until all the data is sent.

    <TD>In many platforms it is impossible to interrupt the server
              threads created by the
              <code>thread-per-connection</code> model.
              This is because these threads are blocked in
              <CODE>read()</CODE> operations (and not in
              <CODE>select()</CODE>).
              As a workaround, the server threads
              periodically poll the ORB to find out if they should
              shutdown.
              This option controls the period of the polling,
              expressed in milliseconds.
              Applications that do not shutdown, or that can otherwise
              ensure that no server threads will be running at
              shutdown (for example if all the clients terminate
              before the server) can disable the polling using  the
              magic value <CODE>INFINITE</CODE>.

              <P>
                If the option is not provided then the ORB uses the

                this flag also expresses the time in milliseconds (as
                a string constant) and the magic value
                <CODE>"INFINITE"</CODE> can be used to disable polling

        Specify the kind of synchronization primitive for the

    <TD><CODE>-ORBClientConnectionHandler</CODE> <EM>MT / ST / RW</EM></TD>

    <TD><A name="-ORBClientConnectionHandler"></a>

        ST means use the single-threaded client connection handler, i.e., the
        leader follower model will not be used.  However, ST does support
        nested upcalls and handling of new requests while waiting for the
        reply from a server. <p>

        MT means use the multi-threaded client connection handler which uses
        the leader follower model. This model allows the use of multiple
        threads with a single Reactor.  <p>

        RW selects a strategy that simply blocks in recv() when waiting for a
        response from the server instead of waiting in the Reactor.  The RW
        strategy only works when the application does not have to worry about
        new request showing up when waiting for a
        response. Further, this strategy cannot be used with AMI
        calls. Therefore, this strategy is appropriate only for "pure"
        synchronous clients. Note that  applications with nested
        upcalls are not "pure" synchronous clients. Also note 
        that this strategy will only effect two way calls, since there is no
        waiting for one way calls. This strategy can also be used in an
        application that is both a client and a server if the server side is
        handled by a separate thread and the client threads are "pure"
        clients. <p>

        Default for this option is MT.

    <TD><CODE>-ORBTransportMuxStrategy</CODE> <EM>EXCLUSIVE / MUXED</EM></TD>

        EXCLUSIVE means that the Transport does not multiplex requests on a
        connection. At a time, there can be only one request pending on a
        connection.  <p>

        MUXED means that Transport multiplexes more than one request at the
        same time on a connection.  This option is often used in
        conjunction with Asynchronous Method Invocation, because
        multiple requests can be sent 'in bulk'. <p>

      TAO provides three strategies to connect to remote  servers. 
      The default <CODE>leader_follower</CODE> strategy uses the
      Reactor and non-blocking connects to connect and this strategy
      participates in the Leader/Followers protocol to synchronize
      access to the Reactor. The <CODE>reactive</CODE> strategy uses
      the Reactor for non-blocking connects but does not take part in
      the Leader/Followers protocol, thus it is better used only in
      single threaded applications. Finally, the <CODE>blocked</CODE>
      strategy as the name implies, blocks the  thread until
      connection is complete. Some of the protocols in TAO viz. SHMIOP

      the CORBA range of priorities and the native range of
      priorities; the <B>direct</B> mapping maps CORBA priorities
      directly to native priorities; and the <B>continuous</B> maps
      the first <i>n</i> CORBA priorities to the range of native
      priorities, where <i>n</i> is the number of native priorities.

      Defaults to <B>direct</B>.  Note that <B>continuous</B> was
      previously referred to as <B>direct</B>.
