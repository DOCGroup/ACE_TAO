	* tao/Profile.h:
	* tao/Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Profile.i: Moved the ObjectKey from the inherited classes
	  to the base class. Added a new protected constructor which can
	  be used by the inherited classes to initialize the ObjectKey
	  properly. Also added a new method set_tagged_components () which
	  is a helper method useful for creating Tagged_Components of an
	  IOR from a CDR stream. Uninlined the constructor, destructor and
	  the methods for refcounted memory management.

	* tao/IIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/UIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/Strategies/UIOP_Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Profile.cpp: Removed the ObjectKey from
	  the following classes since it has now been moved to the base
	  class. 
	  
	  Used the protected constructor in the base class while base
	  member initializations.  

	  Call the set_tagged_componets () to place a list of
	  IIOPEndpoints in the Tagged_Components contained in the profile.

	* tao/Tagged_Components.h:
	* tao/Tagged_Components.cpp:
	* tao/Tagged_Components.i (TAO_Tagged_Components): Reverted the
	  change "Wed Feb 12 15:40:46 2003  Balachandran Natarajan
	  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>" since it was counter
	  productive. 

	* tao/ClientRequestInfo_i.cpp: Reverted the changes made to
	  accomodatethe above change.

	* tao/IIOP_Endpoint.h (TAO_IIOP_Endpoint): 
	* tao/IIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Endpoint.h:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Endpoint.h: Cosmetic changes like removing
	  ORB.h  inclusion etc.

Wed Feb 12 18:15:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Merged in changes from the main trunk.

Wed Feb 12 15:40:46 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tao/Tagged_Components.h:
	* tao/Tagged_Components.cpp:
	* tao/Tagged_Components.i (TAO_Tagged_Components): Create
	  IOP::MultipleComponentProfile lazily, instead of creating
	  actively on the stack and increase the runtime footprint. If we
	  do this we only pay when TAO gets something that TAO doesnt
	  understand. This changed forced us to change the signature of
	  the components (). Instead of returning a reference we now
	  return a pointer to the underlying
	  IOP::MultipleComponentProfile. 

Thu Feb  6 17:51:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tao/Tagged_Components.cpp: Removed some vague print statements. 
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Connector.cpp: Fixed some debug
	  statements. 

Thu Feb  6 16:37:32 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tao/Stub.cpp (ior_info_): 
	* tao/Invocation.cpp:
	* tao/ClientRequestInfo_i.cpp: Added error checks to the last
	  checkins.

	* tao/Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Profile.h:
 	* tao/Profile.i: Added a new method create_tagged_profile
	  (). Infact, this method existed in the derived classes returning
	  a reference to the underlying IOP::TaggedProfile. Since the
	  method existed in all the derived classes and was doing similar
	  things it has now been moved to the base class with a slight
	  signature change. This now returns a pointer to the underlying
	  IOP:TaggedProfile. The signatuer change has been needed because
	  of the change mentioned below.

	  We will henceforth hold a pointer to the IOP::TaggedProfile
	  instead of an instance in the Profile classes. We will create an
	  instance when needed, (heard of lazy evaluation?). This change
	  is forced on us due to the runtime memory consumed by
	  IOR's. Holding a pointer instead of the actual object instance
	  gets us approximately 24 bytes per IOR on Linux on a 32 bit
	  processor. 

	* tao/IIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp: 
	* tao/Strategies/UIOP_Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/UIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Profile.h:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Profile.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Profile.h: Removed create_tagged_profile ()
	  and the instance of IOP::TaggedProfile.
	  
	* tao/Invocation.cpp:
	* tao/Stub.cpp:
	* tao/ClientRequestInfo_i.cpp: Changes forced on us due to the
	  signature change above.
	
Sun Jan 26 21:41:26 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Mering with the main trunk and moving to a new branch. 

Sun Jan 26 21:16:14 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* docs/Options.html: documented the new option.

Mon Jan 20 09:00:55 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	The aim of this checkin is to provide an option to configure the
	size of the dispatcher table in the Muxed_Transport_Strategy. 
	
	* tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.cpp: 
	* tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.h: Added a new virtual method to
	  fetch the dispatcher table size

	* tao/default_client.cpp:
	* tao/default_client.h: Concrete implementation for the new
	  virtual method. The default value for the dispatcher table size
	  is set to TAO_RD_TABLE_SIZE which is defined in orbconf.h. The
	  table size can also be changed at runtime using a -ORB option
	  which is explained below. 

	  We now have an option called -ORBReplyDispatcherTableSize which
	  will parse and set a user provided value as the dispatcher table 
	  size. This gives extra flexibility to the user.
	  
	* tao/orbconf.h: Added TAO_RD_TABLE_SIZE and set the value to be
	  16.
	
	* tao/Muxed_TMS.cpp:
	* tao/Muxed_TMS.h: All the above changes were motivated to reduce
	  the size of the hash table that this class creates increasing
	  the run-time footprint. The default value of 1024 was probably
	  an over kill for this class.
