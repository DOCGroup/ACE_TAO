/**
 * @class TAO_Flushing_Strategy
 *
 * @brief Define the interface for the flushing strategy, i.e. the
 *        algorithm that controls how does the ORB flush outgoing
 *        data.
 *
 * Please read the documentation in the TAO_Transport class to find
 * out more about the design of the outgoing data path.
 *
 * Some applications can block the current thread whenever they are
 * sending out data.  In those cases they can obtain better
 * performance by blocking in calls to write() than by participating
 * in the Leader/Followers protocol to shared the ORB Reactor.
 *
 * This strategy controls how does the ORB schedule and cancel
 * reactive I/O, if there is no reactive I/O the strategy is just a
 * no-op.
