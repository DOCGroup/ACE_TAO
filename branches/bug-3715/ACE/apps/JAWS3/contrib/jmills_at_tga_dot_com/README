I found a couple of problems in my original patch, but I believe this one
works.

In order to use it:

1) Open a Cygwin console and:
   Unpack the sources:
   [bash-2.02]$ cd $ACE_ROOT/apps
   [bash-2.02]$ zcat [path-to-tarball]/JAWS3.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   Apply the patches:
   [bash-2.02]$ cd $ACE_ROOT/apps/JAWS3
   [bash-2.00]$ patch -p0 < [path-to-patch]/jaws3-msvc.pat

   You should see patches applied to: jaws3/Timer.cpp, jaws3/jaws3.dep,
   jaws3/jaws3.dsp, jaws3/jaws3.dsw, jaws3/jaws3.mak

2) Assuming the ACE_lib and ACE_dll projects have been built, you should
   be able to open $ACE_ROOT/apps/JAWS3/jaws3/jaws3.dsw in MS-Visual C++
   and to build the Debug and Release versions.

3) You should also be able to build these verisions with VC++ from a DOS
   command window:

   > cd $ACE_ROOT\apps\JAWS3\jaws3
   > vcvars32
   > nmake CFG="jaws3 - Win32 Debug" -f jaws3.mak
    [blah, blah]

   > nmake CFG="jaws3 - Win32 Release" -f jaws3.mak
    [blah, blah, till you get 'jaws3-r.exe']

That said, what can I try with my shiny new 'jaws3.exe'? I wasn't able to
see any life when I'd started it. I didn't find where the default
parameters are set up: should I have a 'JAWS3/jaws3/svcs.conf'?

I tried the 'telnet' exercise as described in the 'jaws' readme, with no
response. I successfully built a library in the 'JAWS3/small' branch, but
no executable. (That was in Linux.) Is this normal?

As you see, I'm just now starting to meet the sources. Thanks for any
comments.
