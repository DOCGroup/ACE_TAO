This directory contains the sources for a C++ interface to Sun RPCs.

As far as I remember, I got the original sources of the rpc++-library
from some newsgroup, though I don't remember which one. I liked the
basic idea but disliked several aspects of the interface details. So I
adapted it to my likes. I intended some minor changes but soon found
myself renaming classes, changing method parameters, introducing new
classes, etc. The result is by no way compatible with the original
version. It is, I hope, nevertheless useful.

The current version 2.2 of the rpc++ library updates the version 2.1
posted in March 1991. It is the reaction to gcc-2.2 that finally
allows a sufficiently reliable use of templates (almost, see
Installation in rpc++.texi)
