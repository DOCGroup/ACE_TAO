USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN ACE-5.4 and ACE-5.4.1
====================================================

ACE
---

. Fixed "make install" support in ACE+autoconf configurations.

. Fixed autoconf support on Solaris.

. Corrected invalid `aux' directory (on MS Windows) found in ACE
  distribution.

. ACE/TAO build now without problems with MinGW and all ACE tests run
  now without problems

. Added some more support for the new CBuilderX Preview compiler, this
  is not 100% ready yet because the compiler is still a preview and
  has its own problems.

. Added Visual SlickEdit 8.1 MPC template

. Added workaround for compile problems in Borland Release builds

. Cygwin 1.5.9 is now supported

. Tests for IPV6 have been added

. Implement lstat() so that it'll use stat() on platforms that don't
  support lstat(). 

. Problems related to ACE_Event_Handler usage in WFMO_Reactor was
  fixed. 
 
. A wrapper for rmdir () has been added. 

. Threads spawned in thread-per-connection mode never inherited the
  priority. This problem was fixed and this fix is consistent with the
  C++ NPV* books. 

. Fixed memory leaks with ACE_String_Base::resize ()

. Enable the usage of native recursive mutexes for the implementation
  of ACE recursive mutexes on Linux. 

. The ACE Proactor framework can now be enabled for AIX 5.2. Since AIO 
  functionality is not run-time enabled by default on AIX 5.2, the ACE
  Proactor code is not built by default on AIX. To enable it, the
  config.h file must contain #define ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS before
  including the config-aix-5.1.h file.

. The ACE_POSIX_CB_Proactor implementation is now built on all
  platforms except LynxOS. 


USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN ACE-5.3.6 and ACE-5.4
==================================================

ACE:
---
. Added a new makefile commandline flag, static_link, that can be
  used to force static linking when static_libs_only is turned on. It
  uses the new STATIC_LINK_FLAG variable and is currently only
  implemented for for GNU ld, i.e., it adds the "-static" option to
  LDFLAGS. It's turned off by default since using it causes the
  footprint to go up by almost 1 MB on Linux, since it links all the
  system and compiler .a files, but can be turned on if users
  want/need to use it, by enabling both static_libs_only and static_link.


. Added macros ACE_USES_GPROF which enables users to use gprof in a
  multithreaded environment with ACE libs. 

. Added a new functor template class, ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T,
  that's used by ACE_Malloc_T as a factory for the ACE_LOCK template
  parameter, and allows the use of locking strategy classes, like
  ACE_Process_Semaphore and ACE_Thread_Semaphore that don't have a
  satisfactory ctor taking a single required ACE_TCHAR* parameter, to
  be adapted to work with ACE_Malloc_T. 

. The source code examples from "The ACE Programmer's Guide" book by
  Huston, Syyid, and Johnston, are now located in
  $ACE_ROOT/examples/APG. 

. Support for GNU autoconf is now in ACE. Please see ACE-INSTALL.html
  for details. 

. Fixed problems that prevented ACE from being compiled on LynxOS
  4.0.0. 

. Fixed compilation error which prevented ACE from being compiled when
  ACE_COMPILE_TIMEPROBES was set to 1.

. Preliminary support for Tandem NSK has been added.

. Lots of bug fixes with TLI and XPG5. Please see $ACE_ROOT/ChangeLog
  for details.

. Fixed ACE_OS::event_timedwait() and ACE_OS::event_wait() so that
  they use a while loop around the ACE_OS::cond_[timed]wait() calls to
  avoid problems with spurious wakeups, etc. 

. ACE's wrapper around getipnodebyname() and getipnodebyaddr () has
  been made go through the IPv4-only case on ACE_WIN32. Since Windows
  IPv6 implementation doesn't offer support (at thistime) for
  getipnodebyname() the code has been changed to use the IPV4 part of
  the code. 

. Install with Borland C++ of ACE library fixed

ACEXML:
-------

. Fixed memory leak in ACEXML parser.

. Fixed implementations of rewind() in all the CharStreams. They were
  broken previously.

. Fixed bugs in the parser associated with incorrect handling of PE
  References for keywords.
