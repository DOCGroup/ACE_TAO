/**
 * @file Policy_Forward.pidl
 *
 * $Id$
 *
 * @brief Pre-compiled IDL source to forward declare some critical
 * Policy-related types.
 *
 * This file is used to generate the code in
 * Policy_ForwardC.{h,i,cpp}.
 *
 *   The steps to regenerate the code are as follows:
 *
 *   1. Run the tao_idl compiler on the patched pidl file.  The
 *   command used for this is:
 *
 *     tao_idl.exe
 *        -o orig -Ge 1 -GT -GA -Sc
 *          -Wb,export_macro=TAO_Export
 *          -Wb,pre_include="ace/pre.h"
 *          -Wb,post_include="ace/post.h"
 *          Policy_Forward.pidl
 *
 *   2. Then patch the generated code.  This patch (a) eliminates
 *   cycles in the include dependencies.
 *
 *   Apply patches using the following commands:
 *
 *   patch < diffs/Policy_Forward.diff
 *
 *   Note: The diffs were generated with these commands:
 *
 *   for i in Policy_ForwardC.{h,i,cpp}; do
 *     diff -wBbu orig/$i $i;
 *   done > diffs/Policy_Forward.diff
