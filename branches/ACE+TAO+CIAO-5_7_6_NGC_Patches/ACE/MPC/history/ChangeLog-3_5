Fri May 30 15:48:49 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/vc8.txt:

          Document the template variables used by the vc8 (and vc9)
          template.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Modified the 'ImportLibrary' template variable to override the
          setting of the ImportLibrary instead of duplicating the
          ImportLibrary setting which is controled by the 'type_is_dynamic'
          template variable and the 'sharedname' project setting.

Wed May 21 11:43:19 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * clone_build_tree.pl:

          Removed cloned directories that had files previously, but have now
          become empty.

        * prj_install.pl:

          Added support for installing MinGW libraries.

Mon May 19 18:53:21 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrmakefile.mpd:
          Added dependencies so that the executable gets relinked when
          one of the libraries change

Mon May 19 14:29:21 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrmakefile.mpd:
          Build subdirs before subprojects

Wed May 14 18:32:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Limit the cases subprojects are used

Tue May 13 18:32:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Removed SUB_OBJECTS again, it only works when the libs are specified
          with a full path

        * templates/wb26wrmakefile.mpd:
          Generate DEPLIBS, should be added to the dependencies of the
          partialImage but we have to figure out where to plug this into
          the workbench

Tue May 13 16:47:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrmakefile.mpd:
          Improved clean speed

Tue May 13 14:28:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          When generating with standard_build set SUB_OBJECTS to PARTIAL_LIBS
          this way an executable is dependent on its libs, when the libs
          change the executable gets relinked. Also moved some settings
          to the global settings instead of storing them per build spec

Sun May 11 19:38:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/templates/wb26.txt:
        * templates/wb26.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Added enable_subprojects which has to be set as value_template
          to turn on the generation of subprojects because subprojects
          can cause long compile/clean times when using standard
          build support

Wed May  7 13:30:37 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed unnecessary and repeated code.

Wed May  7 08:01:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Improved getting the location of the .project/.wrproject file
          at the moment environment variables are used

Tue May  6 18:05:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          When we find MPC ADD DIRECTIVES set write to 1 so that when a
          project has no dependencies we remove this MPC ADD DIRECTIVES
          from the generated files

        * templates/wb26.mpd:
          Use tabs instead of space

Tue May  6 13:40:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm
        * templates/wb26.mpd:
          Also generate the referenced projects in the .project file

Tue May  6 12:26:09 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Updated the code to work with the .wrproject.

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:

          Added the lines to allow MPC to add dependencies after the
          workspace has been created.

Tue May  6 07:12:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Added helper to create subprojects

Mon May  5 15:45:04 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/mpich.mpb:

          Use MPI_ROOT instead of MPICH_ROOT.  This is in keeping with the
          generic-ness of the environment variables to allow drop-in
          replacements for different implementations.

        * config/openmpi.mpb:

          Added "requires += mpi".

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where files added through a directory would not be
          removed as duplicate if the generated files had the 'gendir' value
          set on them with one or more slash.  This only affected Windows
          project types.

        * registry.pl:

          Fixed the registry value remove option.

Mon May  5 07:40:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * clone_build_tree.pl:
          Don't clone wb26/vxtest generated files, .d files and Makefiles
          in subdirectories

Fri May  2 11:57:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26dll.mpt:
          Added PPC85XXgnu buildspec

Thu May  1 14:32:09 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a template method to allow project creators to disable the
          "no useful targets" warning.

Wed Apr 30 18:59:45 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/openmpi.mpb:

          Added a very simple base project for Open MPI.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Add the .NOTPARALLEL target if there is multiple files generated
          by a custom command.

Wed Apr 30 11:36:17 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed two different bugs:

          1) Using ^ with a wildcard did not function properly if the
             generated files were not already there.  Now, the wildcard
             expansion (prefixed by ^) is not done until the end and
             performed on the list of added files instead of the file
             system.

          2) Flag overrides, such as recurse, gendir, etc., specified for
             directories were not propagated to the files located within
             that directory.  Now, they are copied over to files found
             within the traversed directory.

Sun Apr 27 18:49:45 UTC 2008  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:

          Minor change to the following commit:
          Sun Apr 27 18:15:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Make sure the quote is closed after it is opened. Workbench complains
          otherwise.

Sun Apr 27 18:15:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Set correct tool with standard build

Fri Apr 25 19:05:59 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * clone_build_tree.pl:

          Added a -s option that allows the user to specify a starting
          directory instead of using the current directory.  Thanks to
          Hubert Talbot <Hubert dot Talbot at criq dot qc dot ca> for
          providing the idea and original implementation.

        * docs/USAGE:

          Document the default logging settings.

Fri Apr 25 09:12:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at pristmech dot com>

        * config/global.features:
        * config/unicode.mpb:
          Feature name "uses_wchar" already used within ACE/TAO. Replaces
          the "unicode" feature name. Template / project name within MPC
          still named unicode.

Thu Apr 24 09:55:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at pristmech dot com>

        * config/unicode.mpb:
          Dose not depend upon MFC. Use together if needed for Unicode MFC apps.

Thu Apr 24 07:06:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrmakefile.mpd:
          With a custom only project set the PROJECT_TARGET value so that
          the custom rules are triggered

Wed Apr 23 14:36:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Added support for source_dirs

Wed Apr 23 14:31:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Merging in the changes from the wb26 branch

        * docs/templates/common.txt:
          Document the new make_coexistence

        * docs/templates/wb26.txt:
        * docs/templates/wb26wrproject.txt:
          Renamed wb26wrproject to wb26

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
          Changed from Chad Elliott to make the make_coexistence
          commandline flag available in the template

        * modules/WB26ProjectCreator.pm:
          Use make_coexistence and added template input files

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Supports make_coexistence

        * templates/nmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/nmakeexe.mpt
          Removed _M_AMD64, this is a define that is set by the
          compiler

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Removed _M_IX86_, this is set by the msvc compiler, we shouldn't
          set this. This fixes bugzilla 3293, thanks to David Highley
          <dhighley at highley-recommended dot com> for reporting this

        * templates/wb26.mpd:
        * templates/wb26dll.mpt:
        * templates/wb26exe.mpt:
        * templates/wb26wrmakefile.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          By default we now generate the project files in the same
          directory as the mpc file, this means you can only have one
          project in a directory. If you don't want this, use
          -make_coexistence on the commandline. Also support
          -value_template standard_build=1 to support a standard build,
          but this support is not ready yet.

Mon Mar  7 08:24:46 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/templates/wb26wrproject.txt:
          Added linkflags

Fri Apr  4 17:42:43 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/vc7.txt:
        * docs/templates/vc8.txt:

          Added documentation for the IgnoreAllDefaultLibraries template
          variable.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added a template variable, IgnoreAllDefaultLibraries, as is
          provided in the vc8 template to set this property in the project.
          Thanks to Terry Cordes <terry dot cordes at gmail dot com>.

Fri Apr  4 11:26:34 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/boost_unit_test_framework.mpb:

          Committing this on behalf of Kevin Heifner <heifnerk@ociweb.com>.

          Starting with Boost 1.34 unit_test has had auto linking on
          Windows.  Starting with Boost 1.35 having the explicit along with
          the auto linking caused crashing on exit of compiled applications.
          This change removes the explict lib for most Window compilers.
          vc6 and vc7 will still use explicit linking on the grounds that
          they will likely be using a pre-1.34 version of Boost.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When printing the MPC options into the workspace, enclose the
          parameter in double quotes if it contains a '*' charater too.

Thu Mar  3 07:02:46 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Don't add -ansi to the cflags

Wed Apr  2 14:48:51 UTC 2008  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/xsc_base.mpb:
        * config/xsc_cxx.mpb:
        * config/xsc_idl.mpb:
        * config/xscrt.mpb:
        * config/xscrt_utils.mpb:

          Moved these files to XSC distribution.

Wed Mar  2 18:58:46 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Added support for linkflags

Mon Mar 31 13:46:46 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Modified expand_variables() to convert back slashes to forward
          slashes if the the 'convert_slashes' or the
          'requires_forward_slashes' data members are set to true.  This is
          the case for the wb26 project type.

Mon Mar 31 12:36:58 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/wb26wrproject.txt:

          Added documentation for the template variables for the
          wb26wrproject template.

Fri Mar 28 15:30:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <simon dot massey at prismtech dot com>

        * config/unicode.mpb:
        * config/global.features:
          Allow for the already built-in unicode feature support to be recognised.

Tue Mar 25 14:35:19 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Added support for link_group

Tue Mar 25 11:43:40 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Documented the new third and optional parameter to verbatim which
          allows the addition of verbatim sections instead of overwriting.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Require a parameter to verbatim to enable the verbatim addition
          feature.  Some existing ACE and TAO MPC files rely on the
          overwriting behavior of verbatim.

Mon Mar 24 17:10:23 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed 'verbatim' to add to existing verbatim settings instead of
          overwritting them.

Mon Mar 24 15:18:28 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:

          Document the 'main_functions' configuration file setting.

        * modules/Driver.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Support the ability to specify additional "main" functions to work
          with automatic executable project recognition.

Fri Mar 21 16:06:00 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/MakeWorkspaceBase.pm:

          Fixed the post_workspace() parameters.  The file handle (which is
          unused in the method) was not shifted.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Provide a mechanism for creating multiple output files per
          workspace.

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Use the above mechanism for the wb26projects.lst file.

Thu Mar 20 15:23:06 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          A project will now be marked custom_only if it contains no source
          or resource files, but does contain custom input files.

Thu Mar 20 13:29:19 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          No need to use full_path for the includes. Within the workbench
          we can define the environment variables

Thu Mar 20 13:26:19 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Convert slashes on values provided to back_to_variable() to ensure
          that they match the relative values supplied implicitly through
          environment variables or explicitly through the -relative option.

Thu Mar 20 12:46:46 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Moved the recursive_includes and recursive_libpaths functionality
          out of Creator and into ProjectCreator.  In the process, I fixed
          the following bugs:

          1) Setting and subtracting from recursive_* would cause the value
             to be added instead of the performing desired function.
          2) When values are added in the form of $(VAR)/dir, they are
             expanded, recursed and then the recursed values are turned back
             into the form of $(VAR)/...

        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:

          Changed function parameter code from shifting off of the
          default array to assigning from the default array.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Modified to use the DirectoryManager::path_is_relative() function
          instead of rolling my own regular expression to check for relative
          paths.

Wed Mar 19 14:19:14 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where filenames or paths were used directly within a
          regular expression.  Thanks to Thomas Girard
          <thomas dot g dot girard at free dot fr> for reporting it and
          providing a patch.

Wed Mar 19 13:47:47 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to use <%gendir%> in custom sections.  This
          variable will contain the 'gendir' setting if provided and '.' if
          it is not.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the 'full_path' function would use the current
          directory if the value passed to it was a Windows style path.

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:

          Added the 'full_path' usage back now that the function has been
          fixed.

Wed Mar 19 12:27:53 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where multiple projects within a single MPC file and a
          project type with multiple templates would cause problems due to
          project information being updated for each template.  The fix is
          to only update project info for the visible template.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Modified the 'full_path' template function to allow relative paths
          to be converted to full paths even if they don't exist.  Relative
          paths are assumed to be relative from the current working
          directory (which is the directory of the MPC file).

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a comment about the progress indicator.

Tue Mar 18 18:56:35 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified to write out N files per MPC project.  Now, a file will
          be written out per template file associated with the project type.
          However, the workspace can only "know" about one project file
          (which is determined by the sub-classed project creator).

        * modules/WB26ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Combined all of the functionality from WB26WR* into these modules.
          The project creator causes 3 files per project to be written and 2
          files per workspace.

        * modules/WB26WRMAKEFILEProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WB26WRMAKEFILEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WB26WRPROJECTProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WB26WRPROJECTWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed these files.

Fri Mar 14 16:43:24 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Update documentation on which options can not be used with
          'cmdline'.

        * modules/Driver.pm:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Renamed the option data member from 'coexistence' to
          'make_coexistence' to be consistent with the option name.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where -into passed to the 'cmdline' setting could
          cause serious problems for the resulting generated project files.

          Also, simplified the code used for warning about ignored options
          provided to 'cmdline'.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed an incorrect comment.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Changed to add command line options to the front of the argument
          array so that options provided at the end by the user that require
          a parameter (but are not given one) do not gobble up the added
          options.

Thu Mar 13 02:07:59 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:

          Disable the java feature.

        * config/xsc_base.mpb:

          Removed the empty source_outputext setting.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Allow the setting of *_outputext to empty to have output files
          that are similar to the input name, but without an extension.

          Also, changed function parameter code from shifting off of the
          default array to assigning from the default array.

Sat Mar  8 06:59:25 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Reverted the changes to make the workspace creator case
          insensitive, it doesn't work for all case, probably because
          part of the lookup is done on hashed values. I am going to
          explicitly list a project name in the files that cause
          the problems on VMS

Fri Mar  7 20:27:25 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          mixed case name, thanks to Adam Mitz for noticing this

Fri Mar  7 14:51:25 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Only retrieve the onVMS value only once. Made the handling
          of the after keyword case insensitive. If you have a project
          idl and after += IDL this will work now. This is needed
          because on OpenVMS all filenames are returned lower case by perl
          and the after specified by the user is mixed case which
          resulted in the fact that the after just didn't work
          on OpenVMS. Thanks to Chad Elliott for reviewing the patches
          and point out the possible performance problems of my
          original changes

Thu Mar  6 15:16:25 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Strip out ^ from directory names on OpenVMS. Fixes bugzilla
          3237.

Wed Feb 27 14:09:25 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/Driver.pm:
          On OpenVMS all filenames are returned lower case. The dynamic loading
          of creators then fails. Addressed this by opening the creator file
          and read the first line, it normally starts with package and after
          that the package name. Thanks to Chad Elliott for this idea and
          reviewing the proposed change.

Fri Feb 22 14:49:25 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a new template function, <%full_path()%>, which will expand
          environment variables and resolve relative paths to absolute paths.
          Template authors should only use this when the target build system
          requires it, since it limits the MPC user's flexibility in deciding
          when and how env vars are expanded, and removes "portability" of
          generated project files (by which I mean the ability to move them
          around in a filesystem, or even move them to different machines).

        * templates/wb26.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:

          Made use of the new <%full_path()%> function.  Thanks to Johnny and
          Chad for testing and reviewing this work.  This resolves the
          enhancement request documented in bugzilla bug# 3218.

          Further improvements for partial image support

Thu Jan 24 19:51:12 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          Added a second build target when building an executable. We
          first build a partial image which we then link with all
          the other libraries. This matches more the way we build
          using the GNU makefiles. At the end we want to get rid of
          the libraries as project contents but that still seems to
          be needed.

Thu Jan 24 19:07:12 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:
          When building an executable also add the libraries used to the
          project contents. Only at that moment they are also added to
          the list of files that need to be munched. The other option
          would be to use the ADDED_OBJECTS in the .wrmakefile file but
          to nmppc we have to pass the full path of all the libraries
          and we don't have that information.

          First initial commit for a new generator for VxWorks 6.4/Workbench 2.6.
          A lot of more work has to be done on this generator before it is
          complete, but this is the first starting point. Because the Workbench
          has the restriction that the project file always has to be named
          .project for each project in a directory we create a subdirectory
          and in this directory we place the .project file. Then for each
          source file we use the linked file feature of the workbench. This
          has the current restriction that it must be a full path, no relative
          paths are supported.

        * docs/MPC.sgml:

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug in number_target_deps() where project types with
          dependency names are not the same as file names would not be
          numbered.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * docs/README:
          Added support for recursive_libpaths and recursive_includes.
          These can be used like libpaths and includes, but they recursively
          add also all subdirectories to libpaths/includes. Thanks
          to Chad Elliott for assisting with the implementation of these
          features.

Mon Oct 22 12:11:13 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Documented variable scopes.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where any type of error in a base feature project
          would be reported as if the end of the feature project was not
          found.

          Also, fixed a bug where a scoped template variable addition would
          be evaluated multiple times resulting in a repeition of the added
          value.

Thu Oct 11 17:42:54 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Fixed a problem where too many .resx files were being grouped to a
          "matching" 'Form' source file.

Thu Oct 11 15:34:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Document a requirement of a <%foreach%> that uses a function call
          with commas.  In this case a variable name and base count is
          necessary.

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Documented missing template variables.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Modified the 'remove_from' template function to work in a foreach
          and to allow better string manipulation.

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Use the 'remove_from' function to group .resx files that fully or
          partially match a 'Form' source file.

          Changed the way generates_source works.  See the README for more
          details.

Thu Sep 13 18:02:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * create_base.pl:

          Added a script to create base projects based on MPC library
          projects.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed an informational message to provide more data.

Wed Sep 12 18:55:35 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/qwt.mpb:

          Added a base project for Qwt.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a perl undefined value warning could occur when

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where using two different custom types in the same
          project, both with 'commandflags' mapped to a new keyword, would
          cause scoped settings from one project type to be applied to the
          other project type.

Tue Aug 21 15:27:52 UTC 2007  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:

          Added support for the Windows Mobile 6 platform. This platform
          is targeted specifying the "Windows Mobile 6 Standard SDK (ARMV4I)"
          platform.

Thu Aug 16 12:01:28 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * prj_install.pl:

          Fixed a bug where copying an executable didn't set the execute
          permissions on the new file.  Also, unnecessary intermediate
          directories are no longer made during installation.

Fri Aug 10 18:15:22 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed the misspelling of Graphviz.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a couple of issues:

          1) Makefile.am is no longer overwritten if the only difference is
             in a comment.
          2) The existing configure.ac is edited to contain all of the new
             Makefiles.  If configure.ac doesn't exist, it is created and
             the Makefile list is written out to configure.ac.Makefiles.
          3) @NAME@ substitutions now only happen in the top-level
             workspace.

        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Only warn the user once about each undefined environment variable.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored the file comparison out into a single method on the
          Creator base class.

Wed Aug  8 15:18:04 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Set the required automake version back to 1.9.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          When subtracting, split the subtracted value into elements so that
          they can be removed in any order.

Wed Aug  8 12:29:46 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a code to handle a special associate key to support
          conditional substitutions in the SUBDIRS setting.

Fri Aug  3 13:49:08 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding to a mapped keyword as a scoped template
          variable would wipe out the original setting instead of adding to
          it.

Fri Aug  3 11:53:48 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.mpb:
        * config/mpb.mpb:

          Removed the MPB Define_Custom out of global and into it's own base
          project.  Users can have their base projects inherit from mpb if
          they want to use it.

Tue Jul 31 13:57:54 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Fixed a few instances where mpd was mistakenly used in place of mpt.

Mon Jul 30 13:47:13 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.mpb:

          Added a define custom to allow users to explicitly list .mpb files
          in their projects.

        * prj_install.pl:

          By default, install all .mpb files.

Mon Jul 30 11:33:43 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Support setting a mapped custom defined keyword as a scoped
          template variable.

Wed Jul 11 14:52:02 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/nmake.mpd:
        * templates/nmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/nmakeexe.mpt:

          Moved the default libraries advapi32.lib and user32.lib out of the
          template and into the template-input files using the variable name
          systemlibs.  This allows -value_template systemlibs+=FOO to work.

Fri Jun 29 18:24:22 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Depgen/Driver.pm:

          Removed assigment of () to %types since it was sometimes
          clobbering the value already there (from the BEGIN block).

        * modules/Depgen/NMakeObjectGenerator.pm:
        * depgen.pl:

          Generate dependencies targeting object files instead of cpp files.
          This matches how it's done for GNU make.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Provide output regarding which projects are being built.

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Changed how intermediate and ouptut directories are handled, to
          match the change to make.mpd in:

Wed Jun 27 11:28:50 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/boost_base.mpb:

          Use a new environment variable, BOOST_ROOT_LIB, to determine the
          location of boost libraries.  If this isn't set, it will be
          expanded to $(BOOST_ROOT)/lib which is the default location.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a new workspace feature, associate, that associates a name
          with one or more directories.  It does not add directories to the
          workspace, it only makes an association.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Utilize the associate feature to allow conditional building of
          groups of directories.

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Document the fact that the directory parameter for the -into
          option should be a full path.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed duplicate code from the add_explicit_output() method.
