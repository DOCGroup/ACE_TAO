        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Removed -enableEscapeChar as default argument, it is not supported with the
          4.4 release we have on emulab

Tue Jan 26 12:00:14 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Added -enableEscapeChar as default argument

Mon Jan 25 18:55:14 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Use the new <%bat%>, on windows this is a batch file, not an
          executable

Mon Jan 25 18:46:30 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added additional psuedo template variables (bat, cmd and exe) and
          an optional environment variable to force Windows compatible
          commands to be used in psuedo template variables.  See the
          documentation for more on this.

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Modified this template and template input file to use a C compiler
          on files that have a .c extension instead of always using the C++
          compiler.

Sat Jan 23 18:32:14 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Commented out the dependent setting, with the vc and nmake
          project types, MPC adds .exe as default extension, but this
          script is a .bat file on windows. See bugzilla 3816 for some
          more details.

Thu Jan 21 12:52:48 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Depgen/MakeDependencyWriter.pm:

          Move checks to the file level status.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed bugs with using a scope inside of a foreach.  Also, fixed
          bugs where 'flag_overrides' would sometimes end up as an array
          and would be printed to the project as if it were a string.
          Finally, a filename ending in a '.' will be considered to have an
          extension of '.'.

        * templates/automake.mpd:
          Modified to best handle dependencies with a space or $(...) in
          them.  Dependencies with spaces in them will be handled at the
          template level and $(...) dependencies will be dropped.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Modified to best handle dependencies with a space or $(...) in
          them.  If the 'gnumake' template variable is set, a GNU make
          substitute function will be used.  Otherwise, it will be done at
          the template level for spaces and $(...) dependencies will be
          dropped.

Mon Jan 18 09:24:14 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Add TAO_ROOT and TAO_ROOT/tao to the default include paths to
          get the same behaviour as with TAO_IDL

Sun Jan 17 19:31:14 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/loki.mpb:
          Added base project for loki

Thu Jan 14 17:23:14 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/common.txt:

          Documented the language template variable.

        * modules/Depgen/MakeDependencyWriter.pm:

          Correctly deal with whitespace in file paths.  Also, convert
          <drive letter>: to a cygwin path on Windows (even if the user
          isn't using cygwin).  Otherwise, make will fail.

        * docs/templates/make.txt:
        * templates/make.mpd:

          Use DEPLIBS to cause an executable to be relinked when a static
          library on which the executable depends is updated.  This will
          only be used if the 'gnumake' template variable is set.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Set the 'gnumake' template variable for the linux, nucleus and
          cygwin platforms.

Wed Jan 13 13:07:57 UTC 2010  Abdul Sowayan  <sowayan@gmail.com>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:

          Use the CORBA Compatability Kit (CCK) by default.

Thu Jan  7 16:29:06 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where template variable modifications made one project
          would accidentally be retained for future projects.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a work-around in the create_command_line_string() method for
          dollar signs in the command line arguments.  On non-Windows
          platforms, the argument with dollar signs will be wrapped in
          single quotes.

Tue Jan  5 14:33:11 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/libpng.mpb:
        * config/zlib.mpb:

          Put double quotes around settings that contain $(...) so that when
          it is filled in with something that contains spaces, the value is
          retained correctly.

          There are probably other base projects that could benefit from
          this, but I only need these at the moment.

Mon Jan  4 15:48:32 UTC 2010  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * config/iodbc.mpb:
        * config/odbc.mpb:
        * config/unixodbc.mpb:

          Rewrote the odbc.mpb project in terms of feature specifications
          for UnixODBC and iODBC.

Mon Jan  4 15:25:54 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/qt.mpb:

          Added an include path for non-Windows project types.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Added a method to replace environment variables within a string.
          This isn't new code, it's just removal of duplicated code.

        * modules/Depgen/DependencyEditor.pm:

          Don't process directories as if they were files.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Use environment variable replacement method from Creator.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Replace environment variables in non-scoped assignments as they
          are encountered.  This avoids errors in 'cmdline' assignments
          within aggregated workspaces.

Sat Jan  2 16:37:15 UTC 2010  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * config/odbc.mpb:

          Fixed comment in iODBC section.

Mon Dec 21 18:55:57 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the conditional 'associate' tag (--) would be
          used as an AM_CONDITIONAL in the generated configure.ac.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          The system directory variable for arm_elf_gcc should have been
          $(SYSTEMDIR) not $(SYSTEM).

Thu Dec 17 20:45:21 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding a string containing $(...) would not have
          double quotes which, when used with -expand_vars, could cause
          invalid values if the variable value had a space in it.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Changed the hard-coded /usr/local to use $(SYSTEM) in the
          arm_elf_gcc compiler configuration.

Tue Dec  1 15:05:46 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/common.txt:

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc8java.mpd:
        * templates/vc8vb.mpd:

          Allow the setting of the "DelaySign" value through a template
          variable.

Mon Nov 30 17:17:30 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Depgen/NMakeObjectGenerator.pm:

          Moved a comment.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          If the 'targetoutdir' or 'obj_dir' template variables are set, we
          need to set the VDIR environment variable when calling depgen.pl
          so that the generated dependencies have the right directory.

Thu Nov 26 08:57:00 UTC 2009  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Reverted allowing double-quote characters to be treated
          in a project specific way for the. If quotes are to be
          preserved within "idlflags" inside project mpc files, then
          explicit <%quote%> must be used. Swapping natual quotes
          broke other parts of MPC parsing.

Tue Nov 17 15:05:06 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a problem with my last change.  In some cases, a perl
          variable wasn't set causing strange template variable results.

Mon Nov 16 02:52:53 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/msgfmt.mpb:

          Added a base project to utilize the msgfmt executable.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding to a scoped template variable nullified
          the setting of the non-scoped template variable.

Fri Nov 13 15:30:00 UTC 2009  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          update_template_variable() now processes values through
          replace_parameters() and treats double-quote characters
          in a project specific way. This allows the "tao_idlflags"
          template variable to contain quoted roots, to allow for
          spaces within the directory names.
          Also convert_command_parameters() now also treats
          double-quote characters in a project specific way for the
          same reason, to allow " to be used within "idlflags" inside
          project mpc files.

Wed Nov 11 07:00:20 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:

          Don't use visibility with ndds

Mon Nov  9 15:22:20 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * config/qt4_core.mpb:

          Added QT4_INCDIR to allow user to specify include directory
          which is not relative to QTDIR (such as distributions that
          place qt in /usr/include/qt4).

        * config/qt4_gui.mpb:

          Added QRC resource compiler command handling.
          Added 'ui_' prefix to output filename of UI compiler to match
          the behavior of 'qmake'.

Fri Nov  6 03:39:51 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/mpich.mpb:

          Added an include path and remove an unnecessary library (for
          non-windows project types).

Thu Nov  5 19:39:35 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/XMLProjectBase.pm:

          Fixed the 'equote' pseudo template variable.  It wasn't actually
          escaped before.  Now it is.

Mon Nov  2 13:35:00 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an MPC file used in more than one aggregated
          workspace wouldn't be ignored.

Thu Oct 29 22:55:05 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the current language as a property.  So, prop:cplusplus, for
          example, can be used within a 'specific' scope.

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Minor change.  Separated languages using commas in usage.

Wed Oct 28 16:00:03 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/make.mpd:

          If a custom 'dependent' setting contains a double quote, then we
          must make a fake rule that corresponds to it.  Otherwise, make
          doesn't know how to deal with it.

Fri Oct 23 09:49:30 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Wrap the command with quotes because NDDSHOME could contain spaces

Wed Oct 21 19:29:58 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/make.txt:
        * templates/make.mpd:

          Modified to allow the user to override the 'touch' command via
          -value_template.  For example, if you're using GNU make on Windows
          you may want to replace 'touch' with 'copy nul' (e.g, mwc.pl
          -value_template "touch=copy nul").

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Replaced spaces with tabs so that the generated project is more
          like ones created by Visual Studio.

Tue Oct 20 06:31:30 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:

Mon Oct 19 12:05:30 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Wrap the command with quotes

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Reverted changes (r1646):
          Mon Oct  5 11:38:03 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Commit broke OpenDDS builds on Windows platforms. Custom commands
          should not be wrapped in double quotes; some custom commands use
          compound commands (i.e. dcps_ts.pl).

        * config/udm.mpb:
        * config/wix.mpb:

          Reverted changes (r1649):
          Tue Oct 13 13:38:48 UTC 2009  Sumant Tambe  <sutambe@nospam>

          No longer neccessary.

Fri Oct 16 02:25:30 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Reverted my change from Tue Sep  1 12:58:30 UTC 2009 and modified
          the get_custom_value() method to not add >> files when gendir is
          set to something other than '.'.  Thanks to Steve Stallion for
          tracking this down.

Tue Oct 13 13:38:48 UTC 2009  Sumant Tambe  <sutambe@nospam>

        * config/udm.mpb:
        * config/wix.mpb:

          . Removed quotes because they are no longer necessary. Quotes are
            generated automatically as per Johnny's changes on Oct 5th.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
          Generate quotes around a custom command, the tool we execute could
          be in a path with a space in it

Fri Oct  2 20:31:03 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:

          Updated support for erlang.

Mon Sep 28 15:18:36 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:
        * config/libpng.mpb:

          Added support for libpng.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support for gcc on Nucleus OS.

Thu Sep 24 12:38:20 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Added Beckhoff_HMI_600 (x86)

Tue Sep 22 21:12:20 UTC 2009  Sumant Tambe  <sutambe@nospam>

        * config/udm.mpb:

          Added paths for GME 7 and GME 9.

Thu Sep 17 13:52:10 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/pcre.mpb:

          Only add the $(PCRE_VERSION) variable to the library name when not
          using Microsoft products.  Since the windows version of pcre
          doesn't have a version number, the variable is always empty and
          Visual Studio complains.

Wed Sep  9 21:48:19 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new psuedo variable, 'prj_type', which holds the project
          type as specified by the -type command line option.

        * config/wix.mpb:

          Modified to use the new 'prj_type' pseudo variable.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the duplicate project through workspace aggregation from a
          warning to information.

Tue Sep  8 04:16:19 UTC 2009  Sumant Tambe  <sutambe@nospam>

        * config/udm.mpb:
        * config/wix.mpb:

          Added support for VC9 and UDM version 3.2.1.

Tue Sep  8 00:48:45 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          When the -gfeature_file option is used, turn the file path into a
          full path if it is relative.  This is necessary for when the
          -recurse option is used and a full path isn't provided to the
          feature file.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          When setting up the 'input_ext' and 'output_ext' pseudo template
          variables, set them to an empty string if the input and output
          files do not contain an extension.

Thu Sep  3 19:15:49 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Corrected the documentation for the 'remove_from' template
          function.

        * modules/FeatureParser.pm:

          Sort the feature names as they come out for reproducibility.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an ending /. would not be removed from a
          relative path on Windows.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added missing 'lc' related functions to have a symmetry with 'uc'.

Thu Sep  3 12:57:41 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/default.rel:

          Added a comment about comma separating the columns.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added more info about the 'scope' template function.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the valid languages wouldn't be printed in the
          usage.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a comment about what we're checking and why after
          successfully parsing the template.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed to pass an array reference to the source listing callback
          instead of passing an array.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Added slightly better support for multiple platforms.  It's still
          not fully functional though.

Tue Sep  1 12:58:30 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed code that added output files (added via the '>>'
          construct) when accessing output files from the template.  The
          code was redundant and when gendir was something other than '.',
          it would cause duplicate files to be added when the template was
          generating the output file.

Mon Aug 31 16:41:00 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

          Updated URLs.

        * modules/BCB2007ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/BCB2007WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Corrected comments.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Alphabetized the keywords (which makes it easier when updating
          documentation).  Updated comments and added a minor performance
          enhancment.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where 'features' used in a template would get confused
          with template scopes.

        * modules/WB26ProjectCreator.pm:

          If the user overrides the template, still provide a valid project
          file name in the project_file_name() method.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where duplicate mpc files added by aggregated
          workspaces would not be correctly ignored.

Mon Aug 24 13:10:16 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Changed VAR to VAL.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added missing <a name>'s.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added associated names to the list of AM_CONDITIONAL.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where $(...) used in an exclude block would cause ./
          to be prepended to the value.  Also, only remove unmatched $(...)
          variables after attempting with the secondary relative values.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where $PWD used in a 'cmdline' setting within an
          exclude block would not be evaluated correctly.

Wed Aug 19 14:28:52 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a 'static' property that can be used within the 'specifc'
          and 'conditional' clauses.  The 'static' property will only be set
          if the -static option was used on the command line.

Wed Aug 19 13:49:34 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          We should also avoid adding references to 'custom_only' projects.
          These also cause warnings in Visual Studio.

Wed Aug 19 02:11:03 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * create_base.pl:

          Added a description of what the script does to the usage.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Use DirectoryManager::onVMS() instead of comparing $^O to 'VMS'.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Removed a redundant exit() call.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added comments to the get_special_value method.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added the 'managed' setting to the saved project info structure.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Used the new 'managed' setting in the saved project info structure
          to avoid adding a reference to a non-managed c++ library.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Removed the use of <%language%> in the MPC ADD DEPENDENCIES
          comment.  It was not necessary since we have that information
          available from the saved project info structure.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed the redundant setting of the 'info' data member.

        * registry.pl:

          Added vc10 and wix types.

        * vs_postclean.pl:

          Changed spaces in a regular expression to \s*.

          would not be handled correctly.

        * docs/templates/vc7.txt:

          Documented the DisableSpecificWarnings template variable.

        * rpm/MPC.spec:
        * rpm/buildrpm.sh:

          Made packager dynamic based on who's actually creating the RPM.

          Support the DisableSpecificWarnings template variable as it is in
          vc8 and higher.  Since support isn't built directly into the
          project format, we use the /wd command line option for each
          warning number supplied.

          Cleaned up code.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Reverted one of the performance enhancements from yesterday.  It
          made a faulty assumption that caused issue with the DDS builds.

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a 'requires_make_coexistence' method to always use
          -make_coexistence without having to pass the option on the command
          line.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added an Id tag.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made minor performance enhancements.

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added code to only put top-level dependencies in the project
          files.  This build tool doesn't handle indirectly duplicated
          project dependencies very well.

Mon Aug 10 21:40:58 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Return immediately from generate_default_target_names() if the
          project has custom_only set to 1.  We need not waste time setting
          the sharedname, staticname or exename.

        * modules/WinVersionTranslator.pm:

          Cleaned up and commented the code.

Mon Aug 10 17:55:53 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:

          Added disabled features that were missing.

        * docs/templates/wix.txt:

          Added incomplete documentation for the WIX template variables.

        * modules/GHSProjectCreator.pm:

          Corrected poorly written code.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed a bug in the -relative_file portion of the usage output.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to use the 'temporary' pseudo template variable
          outside of a custom_type context.  It will contain a different
          value than 'temporary' referenced from within the custom_type
          context.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed to use 'exeout' instead of the deprecated 'install'
          project variable name.

          Removed release_link_options for the SuperSonic SDK, the options
          are not ok

          Replaced all language related strings with constants stored in the
          Creator base class.

          Also, fixed a bug where a project that contained source files or
          resource files for a language not supported by the project type
          would be created.  Now, the project will be skipped if the project
          type does not support the language setting.

Wed Aug  5 18:41:55 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC.ico:

          Updated to use the new MPC logo.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified 'conditional' to use properties like 'specific'.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Inherit from XMLProjectBase and WinProjectBase.  The output is xml
          and this is a Windows specific project creator.

        * docs/templates/make.net.txt
        * templates/make.net.mpd:
        * templates/make.net.mpt:

          Updated to support icon files and resx files, the trace template

          Chad Elliot for providing the patch

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Use release_link_options for the SuperSonic SDK

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          No need to set charset anymore

        * docs/templates/vc8.txt:

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a new template function, 'extensions', that can be used to
          get a list of valid extensions based on the component name (e.g,
          source_files, header_files, inline_files, etc.)

        * templates/em3.mpd:

          Use the 'extensions' function instead of hard-coded strings.

Tue Aug  4 16:29:11 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Default the language to 'cplusplus' if it isn't provided during
          construction.  This ensures that language is always set and we
          don't have to check it to make sure it's defined elsewhere.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the behavior of dealing with resource files.  The
          behavior specific to C++ was being applied to all languages.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added implementations of various template functions.  Some were
          required for the bmake template change below.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed unused code.

        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a the case of the WixProjectCreator name.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/bmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/bmakedllexe.mpt:

          Added the ability to build static projects without providing the
          -static option to MPC.  The static-only projects can still be
          created with the -static option, but it is no longer necessary.

Tue Aug  4 10:31:40 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/unicode.mpb:
          Changed this to a feature

Mon Aug  3 16:43:18 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Driver.pm:
        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Added a pair of constants that will be used in determining which
          type of creators to use (either workspace or project).

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed the use of a hard-coded string and simplified some code.

Fri Jul 24 09:29:31 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/nddslib.mpb:
          Added requires += ndds. If you want to use RTI DDS you have to
          add ndds=1 to your default.features file. This way we can add
          dds4ccm support to CIAO without requiring all users to install
          RTI DDS

Fri Jul  3 03:25:31 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for setting the install location of a set of
          files for a project using 'install_location'. This takes a
          comma separated list of directories that represent the location
          for installing the files. The following is a simple example:

            specific (wix) {
              install_location = etc models
            }

          The example above will install files for the given project
          in etc/models directory under the root install directory.

Thu Jul  2 06:37:36 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Fixed bugs GME section of generated Wix files for vc8.

Sun Jun 28 08:05:20 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for installing GME components using Wix. In order
          to include GME components in the installer, you must define the
          following properties in a *wix* scope:

            gme_install     = [0 | 1]; default is 0
            gme_register    = [HKLM | HKCU]; default is HKLM
            gme_progid      = <program id>
            gme_uuid        = <uuid>
            gme_paradigms   = <space separated list>
            gme_has_icon    = [0 | 1]
            gme_description = <descrption of component>
            gme_tooltip     = <tooltip for component>

          The values for each of these properties can be found in
          ComponentConfig.h

Thu Jun 25 06:25:12 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support to creating a directory if there is no output
          file specified in the project.

          Disabled skipping projects if there are no useful targets
          defined.

          Added markers to the top and bottom of the component. The
          name of the markers are: component_top and component_bottom.

        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:
        * templates/wix.mpt:

          . First version of the Wix module that is used in conjuction
            with the Wix toolset that creates .msi files. This project
            type will generate the include files (.wxi) that can be included
            in a .wxs configuration file.

            Right now, the installer only can generate files for
            shared libraries. The next update will include support for
            executables.

Wed Jun 17 18:37:31 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Explicitly set charset to get CharacterSet set when using
          multiple platforms

Tue May 26 19:01:53 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed hard-coded 'resource_files' to a call to get_resource_tag,
          which is a new method on ProjectCreator.  get_resource_tag
          determines the name of 'resource_files' for the current language
          based on the %language hash (for C# and VB this is 'resx_files').

Mon May 25 11:03:31 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Added a new target and corrected some wince versions
