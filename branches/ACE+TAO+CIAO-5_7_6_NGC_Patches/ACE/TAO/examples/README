This directory contains a number of example applications that
illustrate how to program with standard CORBA using TAO.  The
individual directories contain READMEs on how to run the following
examples:

        . Advanced 

          Contains example code from "Advanced CORBA Programming with 
          C++" by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski with slight 
          adaptations for TAO.

        . AMH

          Example code that illustrates working of a simple AMH 'Sink-Server'
          and a more sophisticated AMH 'Middle-Sever' that uses both
          AMH and AMI. Sample 'one-button' perl scripts are provided that 
          show how to run the servers.

        . Borland 

          This directory illustrates how to write a Borland C++
          Builder application using ACE+TAO.

        . Buffered _AMI

          This is a simple test for buffered AMI calls.  It invokes
          multiple AMI calls.  Due to buffering in the ORB, the calls
          are automatically bunched together instead of being
          delivered to the server upon every invocation.

        . Buffered _Oneways

          This is a simple test for buffered oneways.  It invokes
          multiple oneway calls.  Due to buffering in the ORB, the
          calls are automatically bunched together instead of being
          delivered to the server upon every invocation.

        . Callback_Quoter

          Illustrates how to implement distributed callbacks using
          TAO.

        . Content_Server
        
          Three examples that illustrate how to program client/server
          applications for downloading large file content via SMI,
          AMI, and the Iterator and Observer patterns.

        . Event_Comm

          Another illustration of how to implement distributed
          callbacks using TAO.

        . Load_Balancing

          A simple CORBA load balancing service that allows clients to
          treat a group of objects as an equivalence class to improve
          distributed load balancing.

        . Load_Balancing_persistent
        
          A variant of the preceding example that keeps the state of
          the load balancer persistent.

        . Logging 

          This example implements a simple logging service using TAO.

        . mfc

          This is an short example to show how to integrate TAO and
          MFC base GUI applications.

        . OBV

          This is a demonstration of the CORBA 2.3 valuetype feature from
          the Object-by-Value specification.

        . Persistent_Grid

          This example shows how to store the state of CORBA servants in
          persistent memory.

        . PluggableUDP
        
          This example tests the UDP Pluggable Protocol (DIOP) implementation by
          sending oneway requests to a server.

        . POA

          Contains various small examples of POA features based on
          the OMG POA specification.

        . Quoter
        
          Illustrates how to use the Global POA options with multiple
          threads.  This example also shows how to use the Lifecycle
          service. 
                      
        . Simple
          
          Contains a number of simple CORBA examples, which also
          illustrate how to write canonical Orbix/VisiBroker/OmniORB
          examples in TAO using standard CORBA features rather than
          proprietary ORB features.

        . Simulator

          This is a demonstration of the TAO "Distributed Object
          Visualization Environment" (DOVE), which shows how the TAO
          Real-time Event Service can be used to transport monitoring
          events.
