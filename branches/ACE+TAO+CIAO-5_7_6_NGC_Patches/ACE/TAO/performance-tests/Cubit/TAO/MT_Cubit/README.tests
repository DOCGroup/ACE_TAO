ORB/OS CPU processing Overhead Test
-----------------------
1. Execute the following command to obtain latency for CORBA requests:

   ./client -u 10000000 

NOTE:  This runs a copy of the server in the same process as the client
and executes 10,000,000 CORBA requests.  Take a note of the total latency (L1).

2. Execute the following command to obtain latency for collocated calls:

   ./client -u 10000000 -l

NOTE:  The total latency is L2.

The percentage of overhead is calculated in the following way:

% Overhead = ( (L1 - L2) / L1 ) * 100


Latency Test
------------------------
-- configuration:
  (1) su to root when running Solaris or LynxOS.
  (2) Make yourself an Administrator in Windows NT

on the server side:
   ./server -f ior -t 2 &
on the client side:
   ./client -f ior -t 2 -n 4000 -x

NOTE: run_same is a script that automates the running of the latency
tests.  This script output everything to a file.

Context Switch Test
-------------------
Use the same arguments as the latency test, and add "-c"

NOTE: For Windows NT use a tool like Microsoft Spy that is installed with 
MS Visual C++ to obtain the context switch data.
