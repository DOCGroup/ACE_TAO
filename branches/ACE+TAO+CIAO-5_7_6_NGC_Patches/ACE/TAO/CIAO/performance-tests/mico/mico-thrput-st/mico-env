## MICO ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS
#############
# 
# If MICO has been built in /build/ccm/mico-obj
# then add the following to your path and Library paths
# for Bash Shell:
#
#export PATH=/build/ccm/mico-obj/bin:$PATH
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/build/ccm/mico-obj/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# Note: The place where object files and binaries are built could be 
# different from source files. The environment variables use the obj 
# path rather than source path
