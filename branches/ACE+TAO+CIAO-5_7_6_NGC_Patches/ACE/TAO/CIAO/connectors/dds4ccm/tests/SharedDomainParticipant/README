To save resources, every subsequent connector with the same
library name and profile name, should get the same domain-
participant.

There're three connectors. Two (Connector1 and Connector2)
with the same library/profile name.
One (Connector3) with a different library/profile name.

The component checks the pointers of the domainparticipants.
