This test creates instances in DDS by using the
updater port. After that, every instance is updated.
The number of instances (keys) and the number of
updates (iterations) per key can be defined in
the deployment plan.

The Receiver checks whether the keys were updated
correctly by using the read_one method on the reader.
The Receiver should know the number of instances (keys) and
the number of iterations per key. These should be configured
in the deployment plan.

An error is reported when the receiver did not receive
the correct number of samples.
