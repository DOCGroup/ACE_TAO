    <h1>Servant Managers</h1>
    <P>In our <a href=../AMI/index.html>previous example</a>, we
      extended our <a href=../Simple/Client/client.cpp>simple client</a>  
      using synchronous method invocation to handle asynchronous 
      requests: Asynchronous Method Invocation by using 
      the reply handlers.
    </P>
    <P>In applications which have many objects, activating
      all of them all the time would be unnecessary
      and also might require too much memory or too many database
      lookups. For such applications, the POA provides an option 
      for the application to supply servant managers that can
      dynamically supply servants on a per-request basis.
    </P>
    <p> A servant manager is a call-back object that the application 
      registers with a POA. When the POA attempts to determine the
      servant associated with a particular request, it calls back the
      application's servant manager to obtain the servant. To be able
      to register a servant manager with the POA, the 
      <CODE>RequestProcessingPolicyValue</CODE>, which controls the
      matching of requests to servants, is to be set to
      <CODE>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</CODE>.
    </P>
    <P>There are two types of servant managers depending on whether the POA
      retains the associations of objects to servants in its Active
      Object Map or not. This is determined by the value of the 
      <CODE>ServantRetentionPolicy</CODE> set when the
      POA is created. If the value of this policy is set as RETAIN,
      the POA retains the associations, and if the policy value is set
      to be NON_RETAIN, the POA doesn't retain any associations between
      the object and the servant. 
    </P>
    <P>For a POA with the RETAIN value, the servant manager must
      activate the servant associated with the object. This would need
      the servant manager object to support the ServantActivator
      interface. In the case of a POA with the NON_RETAIN value set,
      our servant manager object should be able to locate the servant
      for the requested object and then invoke it. 
    </P>
    <P>In this example, let's use a servant locator to locate the
      servant associated with our Stock_Factory object when a request
      is invoked on this object. 
    </P>
    <H3>The Stock Factory Locator Implementation</H3>
    <P>Our implementation of the Stock_Factory_Locator_i will help 
      us find the Quoter_Stock_Factory servant. 
    </P>
    <P>A servant Locator interface provides two operations: preinvoke
      and postinvoke. The preinvoke operation is invoked to obtain the
      servant to dispatch the request to. The servant returned by
      the preinvoke is used only for a single request. The postinvoke 
      operation is later invoked to destroy the servant created by the
      preinvoke operation. 
    </P>

    <P>In the implementation of the <CODE>preinvoke</CODE> operation, we check if

    <P>The implementation of the <CODE>postinvoke</CODE> operation is
      simple. We just destroy the servant which we created by the
      <CODE>preinvoke</CODE> operation. The <CODE>Cookie IDL

      helps associate the invocation of <CODE>preinvoke</CODE> with

    </PRE>
    <H3> Server Implementation </H3>
    <P>Our first steps would be to create a new POA from the RootPOA
      with the <CODE>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</CODE> value for the 
      <CODE>RequestProcessingPolicy</CODE> and <CODE>NON_RETAIN</CODE>
      for the <CODE>ServantRetentionPolicy</CODE>.
    </P>
    <PRE>
        CORBA::PolicyList policies (3);
        policies.length (3);

        // Assign the polices
        policies [0] =
          poa->create_id_assignment_policy (PortableServer::USER_ID);

        policies [1] = 
          poa->create_request_processing_policy 
                                (PortableServer::USE_SERVANT_MANAGER);

        policies [2] = 
          poa->create_servant_retention_policy (PortableServer::NON_RETAIN);

        // Create the POA with these policies
        PortableServer::POA_var child_poa = 
          poa->create_POA ("childPOA", 
                           poa_manager.in (), 
                           policies);

        // Destroy the policy objects
        for (CORBA::ULong i = 0; i != policies.length (); ++i) {
          policies[i]->destroy ();
        }

    </PRE>
    <P> The policy values are assigned, the <CODE>childPOA</CODE> is
      created with these policies, and later these policy objects can be
      deleted, as a copy of these objects is made by the
      <CODE>create_POA</CODE> and we would not need these objects any more.
    </P>
    <P> Now that we have the POA which can support servant managers,
      the next step would be to create a servant for the servant
      locator object, activate it to obtain its reference, and set it as
      the servant manager with the childPOA.
    </P>
    <PRE>
       // Create a Stock_Factory_Locator servant
       Quoter_Stock_Factory_Locator_i servant_locator_i(orb.in ());
   
       // Need to activate a servant_manager object in the Root POA
       PortableServer::ServantLocator_var servant_locator = 
         servant_locator_i._this ();
    
       // Set the SM with the childPOA
       child_poa->set_servant_manager (servant_locator.in ());
    </PRE>
    <P>Now that we have set the servant manager with the childPOA, the
      next step would be to create a reference with the user-created
      ID in the childPOA which uses the Quoter_Stock_Factory_Locator_i.
      The <CODE>create_reference_with_id</CODE> operation lets us
      create the required object without actually creating its servant.
      The application supplies the ObjectId which signifies the 
      identity of the object in the application domain.
    </P>
    <PRE>
       // Get the Object Id
       PortableServer::ObjectId_var child_oid = 
         PortableServer::string_to_ObjectId ("childFoo");

       //Create the Object without creating the servants
       CORBA::Object_var stock_factory = 
         child_poa->create_reference_with_id (child_oid.in (), 
                                              "IDL:Quoter/Stock_Factory:1.0");
    </PRE>
    <P>After this, as before, let's put this object reference as an IOR
      string and print it out. 
    </P>
    <PRE>
       // Put the object reference as an IOR string
       CORBA::String_var ior = orb->object_to_string (stock_factory.in ());
       
       // Print it out!
       std::cout << ior.in () << std::endl;
    </PRE>
