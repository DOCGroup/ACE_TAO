  @page POAManagerFactory Test README

  This test validates the POAManagerFactory implementation. The PMF is
  described in section 11.3 of the CORBA 3.0.2 specification. The PMF is used
  to create POAManagers that are not associated with any particular POA. This
  is useful when creating POAs on demand and need to disassociate the creation
  of the POAManager. The POAManagerFactory also enables the assignment of
  policies to the POAManager.

  This test validates
   - that a reference to the PMF may be obtained,
   - that the PMF can be used to create POAManager instances,
   - that the PMF correctly creates only one POAManager for a given name,
   - that created POAManagers can be supplied to POAs,
   - that a list of current POAManagers may be obtained from the PMF,
   - that a specific POAManager may be located.

  This test does not evaluate any policies that may be applied to a POAManager
  via the PMF. Currently TAO supports only one POAManager policy, the
  Endpoint Policy. See TAO/tests/POA/EndpointPolicy for information regarding
  that policy.

  Run this test with the supplied run_test.pl, or directly by running
  ./POAManagerFactory
