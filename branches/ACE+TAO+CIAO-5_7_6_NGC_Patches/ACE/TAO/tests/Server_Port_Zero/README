/**

@page Server_Port_Zero Test README File

	A very simple test that checks whether the server can be
started on port 0 using IIOP. Port 0 is reserved by TCP/IP and on
specification of that port the OS should reserve a port
automatically. This feature was broken sometime back. This test is to
ensure that the bug doesn't show up again.
