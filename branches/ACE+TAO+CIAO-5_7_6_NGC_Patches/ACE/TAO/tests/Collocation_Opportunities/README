Description:

A test for making sure the ORB avails all collocation opportunities it
is presented with.

This test has three collocated objects.  The first object is
collocated since the POA created this object and marked it
collocated. In addition, endpoints in the object reference match the
local endpoints and the servant is available.

The second object is collocated since the POA created this object and
marked it collocated. In addition, endpoints in the object reference
match the local endpoints even though the servant is not available at
the time the object was created.

The third object is collocated even though the collocated flag set by
the POA was lost when the second object was converted into a string
and then back. Endpoints in the object reference match the local
endpoints even though the servant is not available at the time the
object was created.

This test checks for POA currents to see if an upcall was collocated
or remote.  If remote, there will be only one POA current since the
upcall will be handled by ORB Task thread.  We ensure that the main
thread does not handle the upcall by setting the
ORBClientConnectionHandler option to RW. If collocated, there will be
a <previous> POA current since the first POA current would be setup
with a call to the <base> servant.
