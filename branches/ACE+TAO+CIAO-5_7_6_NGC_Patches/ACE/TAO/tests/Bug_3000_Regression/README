@page Callback_oneway_rw Test README File

  This test is a modification of the Callback test.

  When using the RW wait startegy, the Transport_Cache_Manager::find_transport()
   temporarily removes the selected handler from the reactor read list. This
   is supposed to be undone in the wait strategy TAO_Wait_On_Read::wait().
   However since in one-way invocations, the wait isn't done the handle gets lost.

  This is demonstrated in this test (a modification of the $TAO_ROOT/tests/CallbackTest).
   A server using RW wait makes a oneway callback to the client(). The client starts
   upon a fixed endpoint. Since the server handle wasn't put back into the reactor
   read list, the client connection closure goes undetected. When a second client comes
   online, the server reuses the half-closed connection to send the one-way callback. This
   deadlocks.
