WHAT:

SunSoft, Inc., Mountain View, California, has placed the source code to
Project DOE's Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler front end
(CFE) on OMG's file server, making the implementation publicly
available. This release is identified by the version number 1.3.

Project DOE is SunSoft's corporate-wide development effort to integrate
distributed object technology into the Solaris O/S.  OMG (Object Management
Group) is the industry wide body formed to create specifications for
distributed object technology. It currently has more than 370 members. OMG
IDL is part of OMG's CORBA 1.1 specification and provides a standardized
way for defining object interfaces. OMG IDL forms the basis for distributed
object interactionin Project DOE.

The SunSoft OMG IDL CFE provides a complete framework for building
CORBA 1.1-compliant preprocessors for OMG IDL.  By using this standard
implementation, developers of OMG IDL compilers will save many months
of work and enhance the portability and interoperability of OMG
IDL-interfaced objects.

The SunSoft OMG IDL CFE allows convenient and fast integration of new back
ends to the compiler.  The release consists of a front end which converts
OMG IDL to an intermediate format, a compiler framework driver, an example
implementation of a compiler back end, and a set of protocols for
interaction between the front and back ends.  The SunSoft OMG IDL CFE
parser uses components generated by yacc and lex.

The SunSoft OMG IDL CFE is designed to allow easy extension of OMG IDL
without impacting existing back-end implementations.  As the CORBA
specification evolves, any new updates to the IDE CFE will be placed
by SunSoft on the OMG server.

This release provides a directory with many examples of OMG IDL
specifications to allow users to become familiar with the process of
writing OMG IDL code.
