          cache size monitor.

Wed Apr  9 18:55:23 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/marshal_buffer.mpc:
        
          Added ENABLE_MONITORS macro to the client project so the
          OS monitors instantiated there will be doing something.
          
        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/run_test.pl:
        
          Replaced literal IOR filename with existing variable name.

Wed Apr  9 15:55:24 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.cpp:

          Removed these files, the base class Size_Monitor is
          sufficient.

        * tao/PortableServer/ServantRetentionStrategyRetain.cpp:

          Added code to construct the active object map monitor's
          unique name using the POA name.

        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map.cpp:

          Added a return statement to eliminate a compiler warning.

Wed Apr  9 13:13:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/client.cpp:

          size monitor when the transport is destroyed.

Tue Apr  8 18:36:21 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.{h,cpp}:

          Changes to signature of register_monitor() call on the
          out stream, corresponding to changes on the method in
          ACE CDR streams.

Tue Apr  8 15:06:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.pidl:
        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.h:
        * tests/monitor/monitor_client.cpp:
          Removed all exceptions from the IDL, if you retrieve a list of
          monitor points you get back just the values for the ones you need
          Getting an exception if one of them is not there is not user
          friendly especially if we retrieve MP's that can go away again

Tue Apr  8 08:53:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * utils/monitor/monitor_client:
          Added -s to specify sleep time in seconds

Tue Apr  8 08:40:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/client.cpp:
          Also use the ACE MP's

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/marshal_buffer.mpc:
          Removed monitor_client

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/run_test.pl:
          Retrieve a few MP values

Tue Apr  8 08:14:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * utils/monitor/monitor_client:
          Use the strategies lib

        * performance-tests/Throughput/monitor_client.cpp:
          Removed, we have a generic client that can be used

        * performance-tests/Throughput/run_test_with_monitor_queries.pl:
          Use the generic client with the -p argument

Tue Apr  8 08:08:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/monitor_client.cpp:
        * utils/monitor/monitor_client:
          Moved the generic monitor client to utils

Mon Apr  7 16:56:06 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Throughput/monitor_client.cpp:

          Changes necessitated by

          Mon Apr  7 12:37:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Apr  7 12:37:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.pidl:
        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.h:
          Assume we always retrieve a list of data to the client for each
          monitor point. At this moment the list has then always size 1

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/monitor_client.cpp:
          Support multiple -p arguments, updated for the list changes. Values
          are printed for 0, have to go through the code again, but this way
          I can share the code with Jeff

Mon Apr  7 11:45:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
          Improved list operations

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/monitor_client.cpp:
          Use ACE_DEBUG

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/run_test.pl:
          Use double quotes

Mon Apr  7 10:24:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.h:
          Extended the implementation by checking if the monitor point is there.
          If not we give an exception. Probably the ACE classes need to have the
          set operations, especially when we retrieve a set and some names are
          invalid we want to have better control when doing a clear. Also we have
          to rework the API to support multiple values with one mp

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/monitor_client.cpp:
          Reworked this client, use -p for the mp to retrieve, with no -p it lists
          all mp available (seems not to work in ACE at this moment). -i specifies
          the number of iterations, with -c all points are cleared

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/run_test.pl:
          Use the name, seems get_opt doesn't handle spaces in names ok

        * tests/Monitor/Marshal_Buffer/server.cpp:
          Improved portabliity

Fri Apr  4 17:24:18 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          Renamed from original file above.

        * performance-tests/Throughput/README:

          Updated documentation with information about enabling and
          disabling monitors, and using the alternative script file
          that includes monitor queries in the test execution.

Wed Apr  2 16:16:19 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Thoughput/Throughput.mpc:
        * performance-tests/Thoughput/monitor_client.cpp:

          Added include of advanced_resource.h and link to Strategies
          to allow the monitor client to process the svc.conf file,
          which it is reading by default.

        * performance-tests/Thoughput/run_test_with_monitors.pl:

          Removed sleep statement before spawning monitor client.

Wed Apr  2 15:41:51 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Throughput/client.cpp:

          Moved instantiation of the ACE_Task_Base subclass out of
          the IF block so it doesn't go out of scope.

Tue Apr  1 19:14:04 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Throughput/run_test_with_monitors.pl:
        * performance-tests/Throughput/monitor_client.cpp:

          New files adding a monitor querying client to the regular
          TAO throughput test, and a separate script to run the
          test with monitor querying.

        * performance-tests/Throughput/Throughput.mpc:

          Added new project containing the new source file above.

        * performance-tests/Throughput/client.cpp:

          Added command line option to expose the object reference
          for monitor queries, and code to do so if the option is
          used.

Mon Mar 31 16:34:00 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Monitor/*:

          Moved this directory to $TAO_ROOT/tests.

          New files comprising an example of the TAO marshaling buffer
          size monitor.

        * MPC/config/monitor.mpb:

          New file defining and MPC base project for applications that
          require the TAO_Monitor library.

Tue Mar 25 22:54:02 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/objectid.h:

          Added the new Monitor object id string to
          TAO_LIST_OF_INITIAL_SERVICES.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp(get_statistic_names):

          Added code to set the length of the newly created
          CORBA::StringSeq, and to increment the index when copying
          from the ACE_Vector.

Tue Mar 25 22:09:07 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Added the Monitor::MC interface to the list of objects
          available to resolve_initial_references.

Tue Mar 25 18:47:14 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:

          Added call to register the monitor of the TAO_OutputCDR
          member.

        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.cpp:

          Changed parent class to the ACE Size_Monitor class.

        * tao/orbconf.h:

          Removed line that would allow enabling TAO monitors
          independently of ACE monitors. Since the CDR buffer size
          monitor is actually implemented in ACE, such a combination
          of options would be inconsistent.

Fri Mar 21 18:14:09 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:

          Fixed some 'may be used uninitialized' warnings from gcc.

          is a CORBA::ULongLong.

Fri Mar 21 17:33:04 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Monitor.mpc:

          Fixed case error in IDL compiler export_include command line
          option.
