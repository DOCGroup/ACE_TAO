        * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
        
          Added call to register the monitor of the TAO_OutputCDR
          member.
          
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.cpp:
        
          Changed parent class to the ACE Size_Monitor class.
          
        * tao/orbconf.h:
        
          Removed line that would allow enabling TAO monitors 
          independently of ACE monitors. Since the CDR buffer size
          monitor is actually implemented in ACE, such a combination
          of options would be inconsistent.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:

Fri Mar 21 17:57:22 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
        
          Fixed compile errors resulting from assignment of an
          ACE_Time_Value struct directly to TimeBase::TimeT, which
          is a CORBA::ULongLong.

Fri Mar 21 17:33:04 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Monitor.mpc:
        
          Fixed case error in IDL compiler export_include command line
          option.

Fri Mar 21 17:06:32 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ETCL/ETCL_include/ETCL_include.h:
        
          Added newline to the end of the file.

Fri Mar 21 17:04:03 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          Corrected include of AnyTypeCode_methods.h.

Fri Mar 21 16:46:31 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ETCL/TAO_ETCL_Constraint.cpp:
        
          Added include of AnyTypeCode_methods.h, needed by gcc,
          and added explicit call to base class constructor in the
          copy constructor of TAO_ETCL_Literal_Constraint, also
          needed by gcc.
          
        * tao/ETCL/TAO_ETCL.mpc:
        
          Added complete path to 'includes' item and header files
          in TAO_ETCL_Parser project.
          
        * tao/ETCL/ETCL_include/EtCL_include.h:
        * tao/ETCL/ETCL_include/ETCL_include.h:
        
          Renamed file, originally misnamed because of a typo.

Fri Mar 21 16:14:07 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/ETCL/TAO_ETCL_Constraint.h:
        
          Fixed include of wrong inline file.

Thu Mar 20 20:01:58 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map_Monitor.cpp:
        
          New files, defining a monitor for the size of the POA's
          Active Object Map.
          
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map.inl:
        * tao/PortableServer/Active_Object_Map.cpp:
        
          Integrated the new Active Object Map size monitor, and
          made cosmetic changes.
          
        * tao/orbconf.h:
        
          Added TAO_ENABLE_MONITORS, conditionally defined based on
          the definition of ACE_ENABLE_MONITORS, but separately
          definable as well.
          
        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.h:
        
          Minor cosmetic changes.

        * MPC/config/tao_etcl_parser.mpb:
        * tao/ETCL/TAO_ETCL_Constraint.cpp:
        * tao/ETCL/TAO_ETCL_Constraint.inl:

        * tao/ETCL/ETCL_include/ETCL_macros.h:
        * tao/ETCL/ETCL_include/etcl_parser_export.h:

          New files, defining the build of the TAO
          ETCL libraries. The TAO_ETCL library contains
          the constraint file and its classes inherits
          from the corresponding ACE_ETCL classes.
          The TAO_ETCL_Parser library
          rebuilds the same source files as
          ACE_ETCL_Parser, but with different includes.

        * tao/Monitor.mpc:

          Added new base project for the ETCL libs.

        * TAO_ACE.mwc:

          Added the ACE MonitorControl and ETCL
          directories.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
        
          Commented out unused local variable.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.cpp:
          Implemented some methods

Tue Mar 18 13:20:30 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.mpc:
          Removed -SS

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor_Impl.{h,cpp}:
          New file

Tue Mar 11 18:13:30 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.mpc:

          - Fixed typo in dynamic flag argument.
          - tweaked IDL compiler command line options.
          - added 'portableserver' to base project list,
            so the MC interface can be accessed remotely.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.h:

          Fixed typo in safe include guard.

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.pidl:

          Added necessary includes of TAO .pidl files.

Mon Mar 10 11:22:23 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/Monitor/Monitor.idl:
          Put this under version control
