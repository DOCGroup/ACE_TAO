This directory contains a simple example of the marshaling
buffer size monitor. A marshaling buffer is identical, in
CORBA, with the total size of an output CDR stream, one of
which is associated with each connection.

In this example, there are 3 processes - a regular server
and client that send and reply a string as described in
the IDL interface, and a monitoring client, which gets
the object reference of the regular client's Monitor::MC
interface, and queries it repeatedly for the value stored
in the monitor point associated with the connection's
output CDR stream.

Note that the regular 'client' in this example also
plays the role of a server, since it must make its
Monitor::MC object reference available and listen for
calls on it.

To run the example, execute the 'run_test.pl' Perl script.
The server process outputs the length of the strings it
receives, the client process outputs the length of the
string replies it gets, and the monitor client outputs
the size of the marshaling buffer each time it queries.

There are 3 strings passed (and returned) in the execution
of the example, of length 1k (1024), 2k (2048) and 3k (3072)
bytes. Notice that, due to alignment and CDR encoding rules,
the buffer sizes are always slightly larger than the raw
string length.
