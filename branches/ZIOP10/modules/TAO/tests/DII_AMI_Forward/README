@page DII_AMI_Forward Test README File

This test illustrates the new feature outlined in bug 3105 for
supporting the detection and handling of a LOCATION FORWARD 
exception within a DII based asynch invocation.

DII Asynch reply handlers operate very close to the TAO internals,
receiving raw CDR buffers as parameters rather than collections of
arguments. This example is built on apriori knowledge of the nature
of the call and its return type in order to work. A more general 
purpose handler would take a reference to the request instance in 
order to handle a variety of responses. As such, it is impractical
to have a single instance of the reply handler supporting more than
one pending invocation.

This test is designed around a server that, on the receipt of the 
first invocation raises a location forward exception. The client's
DII asynch reply handler then reissues the invocation using the new
object reference and finally handles the reply.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
