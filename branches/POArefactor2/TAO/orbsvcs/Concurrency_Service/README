This file describes how to run the TAO Concurrency Service and its
accompanying tests.  In addition, it describes the locations of the
files that make up the service and tests.  For a general description
of the directory structure for the services please consult

        $TAO_ROOT/docs/orbsvcs.html

----------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN THE SERVICE

The Concurrency Service server runs in a thread-per-connection
concurrency model, which is specified by the svc.conf file.  This
model is necessary to enable the server to block in a dedicated
thread, i.e., one for each client.  The concurrency service will not
run in the reactive model.

The server itself is located in the

$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Concurrency_Service

directory.

The server accepts the folowing options:

        usage:  ./Concurrency_Service [-d] [-o] <ior_output_file>
        [-d] is the debug option
        [-o] <ior_output_file> outputs the IOR of the lock set factory
             to the file
        [-s] Prevents the concurency server from using the naming server

The lock set factory is registered in the naming service in the
CosConcurrency context with the name "LockSetFactory".

----------------------------------------

THE IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the concurrency service objects is located in
the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency directory and consists of
the following files:

        CC_LockSet.{h,cpp} Implementation of the lock set. At present
		there is only one implementation of the lock set which
		implements multiple possesion semantics for both
		transactional (which is not otherwise supported) and
		non-transactional clients. Please see the comments in
		the CC_LockSet.h file for further details.

        CC_LockSetFactory.{h,cpp} Iplementation of the lock set
                factory

        Concurrency_Utils.{h,cpp} Wrapper around the concurrency
                server.

The current implementation does not support transactions.  If you'd
like to add support for transactions to TAO please let us know.

----------------------------------------

THE TESTS

The tests are located in the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Concurrency
directory.  There are two types of tests:

        . A simple test -- which tests that it is possible to create
          locks and lock them in all the different lock modes

        . A more extended test which requires two (or more)
          processes.

The client accepts the following options:

        usage:  ./CC_client [-b] [-d]
                        [-c] <stdin|testscriptname>
                        [-e] <test;arg1;arg2>
                        [-f cc_factory-obj-ref-key-file]
                        [-k cc-obj-ref-key] [-x] [-s]

        . The [-b] option runs the basic tests.
        . The [-c] option runs a test script against the concurrency
          service server. This option is described in more detail in
          the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Concurrency/README file. It is
          the intent that this type of testing will be used instead of
          the [-b] and [-e] tests. These tests are retained for
          backwards compatibility.
        . The [-d] option is the debug option.
        . The [-e] option is for running one of the extended tests. The
          format of the argument to the -e option is <test;arg1;arg2>
          where test is the name of the test (at present test =
          {1,2,3}) and arg1 and arg2 are arguments to the test.  See
          the example below.

        . The [-f] option reads the factory IOR from a file. This is
          currently not supported.

        . The [-k] option takes the factory IOR as argument on the
          commandline. This is currently not supported.

        . The [-x] option tells the server to shut down
          gracefully. Currently this has no effect.

        . The [-s] option tells the test not to use the naming
          service. This is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------

EXAMPLE TEST RUN

        Window-1> ./Concurrency_Service -d
        Window-2> ./CC_client -b
        Window-2> ./CC_client -e '1;Name'
        Window-2> ./CC_client -e '2;Name'
        Window-3> ./CC_client -e '3;Name'

NOTE: It seems that there is a problem using the naming service the
      first time the client is run. This error does not appear if the
      environment variable 'NameService' is set to the IOR of the naming
      service (the IOR of the naming service is printed when the
      Concurrency_Control server is started).
