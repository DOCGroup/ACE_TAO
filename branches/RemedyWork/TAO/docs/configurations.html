<h3>
Configuring TAO's Components</h3>

<h3> Overview</h3>

<p> As described in the <a href="Options.html">options</a>
documentation, various components in TAO can be customized by
specifying options for those components.  This document illustrates
how to combine these options to affect the behavior and performance of
a TAO ORB, particularly its <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/CACM-arch.pdf">concurrency
model</a>.  </p>

<p> TAO configures itself using the <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Svc-Conf.pdf">ACE Service
Configurator</a> framework.  Options are therefore specified using the
<tt>svc.conf</tt> file (if you want to use a different file name, use
the <tt><a href="Options.html#svcfonf">-ORBSvcConf</a></tt> option).
Configurations selected via a <tt>svc.conf</tt> file are global
<EM>per-process</EM>, e.g., all ORBs in a process will share the same
concurrency model configured via a <code>svc.conf</code> file.  You
can also setup default configurations for your programs.  Please see
the <a href="#programming">Programming Considerations</a> for more
detailed discussion on this.</p>

<h3>
<a NAME="comp"></a>Configuring Key ORB Components</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a name="orb"><b>Number of ORBs</b> -- </a></li>
      TAO can assign multiple endpoints to an ORB.
      It is therefore not necessary to create multiple ORBs to accept
      requests from multiple endpoints.  However, multiple ORBs can be
      used to support different policies within the same process,
      <EM>e.g.</EM>, handling requests in different thread
      priorities.  Multiple ORBs are most commonly used in the "ORB
      per-priority" pattern to avoid priority inversion in real-time
      systems. <p>

  <li><a NAME="concurrency"></a><b>Server concurrency strategy</b> --
      The default server strategy factory provided by TAO supports two
      types of concurrency strategies that can be specified by adding
      the <tt>-ORBConcurrency</tt> flag in the <code><a
      href="Options.html#orb_concurrency">Server_Strategy_Factory</a></code>
      entry of the <code>svc.conf</code> file. This
      specifies the concurrency strategy an ORB uses.  This strategy
      is orthogonal to the number of ORBs or threads that are
      configured in a server process.  </li><P>

      <ul>
        <li><tt>reactive</tt>: The ORB handles requests reactively,
            i.e., the ORB runs in one thread and service multiple
            requests/connections simultaneously using the
            <A
            HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-papers.html#reactor">
            ACE_Reactor</A>, which uses <tt>select</TT> or a similar
            event demultiplexing mechanism supported by the
            platform. </li> <P>

        <li><tt>thread-per-connection</tt>: The ORB handles new
            connections by spawning a new thread whose job is to
            service requests coming from the connection.</li>
      </UL><P>

  <li><a name="orb"><b>Thread Pools</b></a></li> --
      TAO supports several types of thread pools. <P>

      <ul>
        <li><tt>reactive</tt>: In this approach, each thread
        in the thread pool has an ORB that accepts and processes
        requests reactively. This is also called as the
        "ORB-per-thread" model <P>

        <li><P><tt>leader/followers</tt>: In this model, the user must
	  create several threads, all of which invoke
	  <CODE>ORB::run</CODE>, the ORB will select one of the threads
	  to wait for incoming requests.
	  This thread is called the leader thread and will process the
	  first request that arrives to the ORB, but before
	  doing so the ORB will selects another thread in the pool to
	  become the leader.
	  In other words the threads in the pool take turns to
	  process the events.
	</p>

	</li>

      </UL><P>

  <!--
  <li><a NAME="orb_resources"></a><b>ORB resources</b> --

      <ul>
        <li><tt>global</tt>: All threads using the ORB access to
            the a set of global per-ORB resources. The same set of
            pre-ORB resources are shared by all threads accessing the
            ORB.  Notice that if you have more than one ORB, each ORB
            owns its own global resources.

        <li><tt>tss</tt>: Each thread accessing an ORB gets its own
            set of thread-specific resources for the ORB.

            <!-- @@ What about resource inheritance? - ->
      </ul><P></li> -->

  <li><a NAME="coltbl"></a><b>Collocation Table</b> -- An ORB can have
      several listening endpoints.  If there are several ORBs in a
      process and a global collocation table is used, then all objects
      in the same process are considered collocated.  If not, only
      objects reside in the same <em>ORB</em> are considered
      collocated.  You can control the usage of global collocation
      table by passing the <code><a href="Options.html#-ORBCollocation">
      -ORBCollocation </a></code> flag as an argument of <code>
      ORB_init </code> (most often thru the command line flags.) <p>

  <li> <a NAME="orbsvcs"></a><b>orbsvcs Library</b> --
      By default,
      TAO's Makefiles build all the services that TAO
      supports.
      To reduce build time you can exclude unused services,
      by defining the <tt>TAO_ORBSVCS</tt> makefile variable.
      We recommend using one of these two approaches:</li><P>

      <ol>
        <li>In your
            <tt>$(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
            </tt> file,

        <li>On the make command line, <i>e.g.</i>, <tt>make
            TAO_ORBSVCS=RTEvent</tt>, or

        <li>Set (and export) a <tt>TAO_ORBSVCS</tt> environment variable.
      </ol><p>

      Please see the <code><a
      href="../orbsvcs/orbsvcs/GNUMakefile">ORBSVCS
      Makefile</a></code> for the default setting of
      <code>TAO_ORBSVCS</code>.<p>

      Please note that the Naming Service will always be built, even
      if Naming is not specified in <code>TAO_ORBSVCS</code>.  That's
      because many examples, tests, and presumably applications use it.<p>

<h3>
Programming Considerations<a NAME="programming"></a></h3>

There are several ways to pass option flags into TAO's
components. <P>

<ul>

  <li><p>The plain vanilla approach is do nothing.  All TAO components
      use their <a
      href="Options.html">default settings</A>.</p>

  <li><p>The most common use case is to use a file called
      <code>svc.conf</code>.  On most platforms, TAO programs
      automatically search and read in the file.  The disadvantage of
      this approach is you always need a <code>svc.conf</code> file if
      you want to do use non-default configuration.</p>

  <li><p>You can use <code>-ORBSvcConf <em>filename</em></code> to use
      a config file that is not called <code>svc.conf</code>.
      Specifying <code>-ORBSvcConf</code> exclude the reading of
      default <code>svc.conf</code> file.</p>

  <li><p>If you don't want the application users to worry about
      setting up or knowing about <code>svc.conf</code> files, you can
      call <code>TAO_Internal::default_svc_conf_entries()</code>
      before calling the first <code>ORB_init()</code> in your program
      to set up the default svc.conf entries.  In this case, if a TAO
      application cannot find a svc.conf file, it will configure TAO's
      components using the default settings.  You can still use a
      <code>svc.conf</code> file or use <code>-ORBSvcConf</code>
      option to tune the program.<P>

  <li><p>TAO programs evaluate the configuration settings in the following
      order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>File specified in <code>-ORBSvcConf</code> command-line
            option, if one exist.  Otherwise, the
            <code>svc.conf</code> in the start-up directory will be
            evaluated, if one exist.
        <li>Default entries set by
            <code>TAO_Internal::default_svc_conf_entries()</code>, if
            ones exist.
        <li>Default configuration as specified in <a
            href="Options.html">this document</a>.
      </ol>

      <p>Notice that the first encountered component settings are
      always the ones take effect.  For example, if you set the entries
      for <code>Resource_Factory</code> and
      <code>Server_Strategy_Factory</code> using
      <code>TAO_Internal::default_svc_conf_entries()</code> in a
      program and you also have a file called <code>svc.conf</code>
      which has an entry for <code>Resource_Factory</code>.  This
      program will use the entry for <code>Resource_Factory</code> in
      the <code>svc.conf</code> file, the entry for
      <code>Server_Strategy_Factory</code> set in the program, and the
      in-stock <code>Client_Strategy_Factory</code> that TAO defines. <P>

  <li><p>Some platforms do not support reading of <code>svc.conf</code>
      files or perhaps you would rather not to use this feature.  In these cases,
      you can define <code>TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP</code>
      in your ACE <code>config.h</code> file and recompile the TAO
      libraries.  When this flag is set, TAO programs will not try to search for
      the default <code>svc.conf</code> file.  You can still use
      <code>-ORBSvcConf</code> to initialize the components (assuming
      the platform supports it).</p>

      <p>On these platform, you can alter the default settings for
      TAO components by defining the following macros in your
      <code>config.h</code> file:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>TAO_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_FACTORY_ARGS</code>
        <li><code>TAO_ADVANCED_RESOURCE_FACTORY_ARGS</code>
        <li><code>TAO_DEFAULT_SERVER_STRATEGY_FACTORY_ARGS</code>
        <li><code>TAO_DEFAULT_CLIENT_STRATEGY_FACTORY_ARGS</code>
      </ul>

      <p>The ACE Makefiles <code>fakesvcconf</code> flag can be
      used to define <code>TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP</code>.
      To define that macro, just add <code>fakesvcconf=1</code> to
      your <code>make</code> invocation.

      <p>See <a href="../tao/orbconf.h"><code>orbconf.h</code></a> for
      an example.
</ul>

<h3>
Configuration for Homogenous Systems<a NAME="homogenous"></a></h3>

<ul>
  <LI><b>Compile-time options</b><a NAME="homogenous_compile"></a>
      <p>Many real-time applications run on homogenous environments, TAO (and
      ACE) can take advantage of this fact by simplifying the server side demarshaling;
      to enable this feature you have to edit the <tt>$ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h</tt>
      file and enable the macro <tt>ACE_DISABLE_SWAP_ON_READ</tt>.
      <p>In this systems it is also common that server and the client startup
      and shutdown simultaneously, in those circumstances there is no need to
      check the timestamps in the POA, another macro (<tt>POA_NO_TIMESTAMP</tt>)
      can be used for this purpose.
      <p>Users running in embedded systems may also need to modify the default
      options for TAO, the macros <tt>TAO_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_FACTORY_ARGS</tt>, <tt>TAO_ADVANCED_RESOURCE_FACTORY_ARGS</tt>,
      <tt>TAO_DEFAULT_CLIENT_STRATEGY_FACTORY_ARGS</tt> and <tt>TAO_DEFAULT_SERVER_STRATEGY_FACTORY_ARGS</tt>
      can be used for those purposes. If the footprint size is an issue users
      may consider writing custom strategy factories that only create the right
      strategies, this eliminates the parsing code for the different options.

      <p>
  <LI><b>Run-time options</b><a NAME="homogenous_runtime"></a>
      <P>Unix systems that support local IPC (formerly known as Unix domain
      sockets) can take advantage of TAO's UIOP pluggable transport protocol
      to improve performance considerably.  To use TAO's UIOP pluggable
      protocol, simply specify a UIOP endpoint on the command line using
      the <tt>-ORBEndpoint</tt> option described in the
      <A HREF="Options.html">options</A> documentation.  Additional
      information about
      TAO's UIOP pluggable protocol can be found in the
      <A HREF="releasenotes/index.html#pp">release notes</A>.
      <p>
      <p>Some embedded systems run without the benefit of a DNS server, in that
      case they can use the <tt>-ORBDottedDecimalAddresses</tt> option; the ORB
      will avoid the use of hostnames in the profiles it generates, thus clients
      don't need to do any name resolution. Use the compile-time define
      <tt>TAO_USES_DOTTED_DECIMAL_ADDRESSES</tt> in
      <tt>$TAO_ROOT/tao/orbconf.h</tt> to make this the default behavior.
</ul>

<h3>Configuration Suggestions<A name="suggestions"</A></h3>

Choosing the right configuration is hard and, of course, depends on your
application. In the following section we will attempt to describe some
motivations for features in TAO, hopefully that can guide you through the
choice of your configuration options.
<ul>

  <LI><b>ORB-per-thread</b> -- The main motivation behind this options is to
      minimize priority inversion, since threads share no ORB resources no locking
      is required and thus, priority is preserved in most cases (assuming proper
      support from the OS). If you are not too concerned about priority inversion
      try to use a single ORB, using ORB-per-thread has some tradeoffs (like
      calling ORB_init on each thread, activation of a servant is more complicated,
      etc.) Some of the problems, can be minimized, but they require even more
      careful analysis.
      <p>As the reader will note this is a delicate configuration option, the
      rule of thumb should be <b>not</b> to use ORB-per-thread unless it is really
      required. <P>

  <li>

      <b>Collocation tables</b> -- Why would an application not want to
      use the global collocation table?  Because a collocated method
      invocation is run in the client's thread-of-control.  If objects
      are to serve requests only at a well
      known priority the application can be configured with the
      ORB-per-thread option, and the object is activated only in the thread
      (ORB) corresponding to the desired priority.  But using a global table
      would subvert the priority assignment (because calls would run
      at the priority of the client).</li><P>

  <li> <b>Single-threaded vs. Multi-threaded Connection Handlers</b>
      -- The
      <tt>Client_Connection_Handler</tt> is the component in TAO that writes
      the requests to the underlying transport socket; this is also the
      component that reads the response back from the server.</li>

      <p>

      While waiting for this response new requests to the local ORB can
      arrive, this is the so-called nested upcall support. TAO supports two
      mechanisms for handling nested upcalls, the default uses the
      leader-follower model to allow multiple threads to wait on a single
      reactor for several concurrent requests; sometimes this configuration
      can be an overkill, if only one thread is using a reactor at the same
      time a lighter weight implementation can be used.  <p>This
      configuration is controlled by the <tt>-ORBClientConnectionHandler</tt>
      option, good opportunities to use this option are:<P>

      <ul>
        <li> Single threaded servers</li>

        <li> Servers running in ORB-per-thread mode (pseudo single
            threaded.)</li>

        <li> Pure clients that will never receive a request</li>
      </ul><P>

<li>
    <b>Allocator for input CDR streams</b> -- Normally the application has no
    access to this buffer, and it is only used on the demarshaling of arguments
    (or results). It is almost always better to use the "<tt>-ORBInputCDRAllocator
    null</tt>" option since it will allocate memory from a thread specific allocator
    and it will not need locks to manage that memory.</li>

    <p>In some cases the user <i>may</i> gain access to the CDR stream
    buffer: TAO makes no copies when demarshaling octet sequences, instead
    the octet sequence simply points to the CDR buffer, since the octet
    sequence does not own this buffer a copy must be made if the user
    wants to keep the buffer after the upcall.

    <p>The user can, however, increase the reference count on the CDR
    stream buffer, thus allowing her to extend the lifetime of this
    buffer. Still passing this buffer to another thread and attempting to
    release it in that thread will result in some memory leak or
    corruption. Users willing to use this feature of TAO can still do so,
    <b>if</b> they use a global allocator for their input CDR stream, but
    that will introduce extra locking on the critical path.  <p>As the
    reader can see this is an option that has limited applicability and
    requires careful consideration of the tradeoffs involved.
