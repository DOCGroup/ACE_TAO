    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
<!-- We talk of real-time here and throughout this document I dont -->
<!-- see where we have talked about lower latencies one of the -->
<!-- important aspects of RT systems. I understand the term -->
<!-- "throughput" is used for latencies. My understanding is that -->
<!-- improved latencies can give better throughtput, but better -->
<!-- throughput doesnt necessarily mean lower latencies. Please -->
<!-- correct me if I am wrong -->
      TAO is increasingly being used to support high-performance
      distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) applications.  DRE
      applications constitute an important class of distributed
      systems where predictability and efficiency are essential for
      success.  This document describes how to configure <a href
      ="index.html">TAO</a> to enhance its throughput, scalability,
    <!-- Ossama, let me know if I am offtrack. Would it be better if -->
    <!-- we mention this as "reduced latencies" instead of improved -->
    <!-- latencies. I can make the change but thought would discuss -->
    <!-- with you before jumping on to it. - Bala -->
    <!-- Bala, aren't they the same? In any case Doug wrote -->
    <!-- this. ;-) -->
    <!-- Shouldnt be an issue though :-) -->
      and latency for a variety of applications.  We also explain
      various ways to speedup the compilation of ACE+TAO and
      applications that use ACE+TAO.  </p>

     <p>
      As with most applications, including compilers, enabling
      optimizations can often introduce side-effects that may not be
      desirable for all use-cases.  TAO's default configuration
      therefore emphasizes programming simplicity rather than top
      speed or scalability.  Our goal is to assure that CORBA
      applications work correctly ``out-of-the-box,'' while also
      enabling developers to further optimize their CORBA applications
      to meet stringent performance requirements. </P>

    <p>
      TAO's performance tuning philosophy reflects the fact that there
      are trade-offs between speed, size, scalability, and programming
      simplicity.  For example, certain ORB configurations work well
      for a large number of clients, whereas others work better for a
      small number.  Likewise, certain configurations minimize
      internal ORB synchronization and memory allocation overhead by
      making assumptions about how applications are designed.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <!-- Ossama, do we call it optimizing throughput? Shouldnt -->

	<!--
           Bala, by optimizing throughput aren't we improving it?  I
           prefer "optimizing" but if the general consensus is that
           "improving" is better than I won't debate the issue.

          <!-- Neither am I :-). I dont know why the term Optimizing -->

    <h3>Optimizing Throughput</h3>

    <p>
    In this context, ``throughput'' refers to the number of events
    occurring per unit time, where ``events'' can refer to
    ORB-mediated operation invocations, for example.  This section
    describes how to optimize client and server throughput.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to understand that enabling throughput
      optimizations for the client may not affect the server
      performance and vice versa.  In particular, the client and
      server ORBs may be designed by different ORB suppliers.
    </p>

    <a name="client_throughput"></a>
    <h4>Optimizing Client Throughput</h4>

    <p>
      Client ORB throughput optimizations improve the rate at which
      CORBA requests (operation invocations) are sent to the target
      server.  Depending on the application, various techniques can be
      employed to improve the rate at which CORBA requests are sent
      and/or the amount of work the client can perform as requests are
      sent or replies received.  These techniques consist of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <!-- Ossama, I have my jitters on putting this here for the -->
          <!-- following reasons -->
          <!-- 1. AMI doesnt have many optimizations built in. Most of -->
          <!-- the configurations that we mention below wouldnt work -->
          <!-- with AMI. Say for instance we dont have a RW handler -->
          <!-- for AMI -->

	<!--
          Yes, I know that.  No claim was made that the ORB
          configurations mentioned below should be or could be used
          with AMI.  AMI was only given as an example of how to
          potentially improve throughput using programmatical means,
          as opposed to using static ORB configurations.
        -->

          <!-- Agreed. With the little I know of users, they try to -->
          <!-- mix and match. They tend to assume that programming -->
          <!-- considerations can be mixed and matched with  ORB -->
          <!-- configurations. Hence my jitters. If we split things as -->
          <!-- Dr.Schmidt suggests, I guess things could be better -->


          <!-- 2.For long we have been interchanging the terms, -->
          <!-- "Throughput" and "Latency". AMI is good for -->
          <!-- "Throughput", you could keep the client thread busy by -->
          <!-- making more invocations. I doubt whether that leads to -->
          <!-- better latencies. I dont know. Further the ORB -->

	<!--
	     No such claim was made, so what's the issue here?  This
	     section is after all about improving throughput not
	     latency. :-)
         -->
          <!-- Aahn!! See we interchange the usage of Latency and -->
          <!-- Throughput which doesnt sound like a good idea. The ORB -->
          <!-- configuration options that we suggest are mainly for -->
          <!-- getting low latencies. Throughput is an after effect of -->
          <!-- it.  -->

          <!-- configuration section talks about options that improve -->
          <!-- latencies. IMHO, lower latencies can lead to improved -->

	<!-- If the options I wrote about improve latency and not
	throughput that should certainly be corrected. -->

       <!-- I guess that is where we need to start working. The -->
       <!-- strategies that we talk gives lower latencies and hence -->
       <!-- better throughput. They have been -->
       <!-- implemented/designed/thought about as options that will -->
       <!-- give low latencies. Making that change should help a lot. -->

          <!-- throughput, but vice-versa may not apply. -->
          <!-- Please correct me if I am wrong. I am willing to stand -->
          <!-- corrected.  -->

	Asynchronous Method Invocations (AMI)
        <!-- Ossama, are there other examples you can list here? -->
	<!-- ADD BUFFERED ONEWAYS -->
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>ORB configurations</b>, such as disabling synchronization
	of various parts of the ORB in a single-threaded application
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We explore these techniques below.
    </p>

    <h4>Run-time Client Optimizations</h4>

    <p>
      For two-way invocations, i.e., those that expect a reply
      (including ``<CODE>void</CODE>'' replies), Asynchronous method
      invocations (AMI) can be used to give the client the opportunity
      to perform other work as a CORBA request is sent to the target,
      handled by the target, and the reply is received.
    </p>

    <h4>Client Optimizations via ORB Configuration</h4>

    <p>
      A TAO client ORB can be optimized for various types of
      applications:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Single-Threaded</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Other options include disabling synchronization in the
	      components of TAO responsible for constructing and sending
	      requests to the target and for receiving replies.  These
	      components are called ``connection handlers.''  To disable
	      synchronization in the client connection handlers, simply
	      add:
	    </p>
              <!-- Ossama, if we are going to ask people to use ST, -->
              <!-- they could as well use ST reactor too. TAO uses a -->
              <!-- reactor for ST and it would be better to use ST -->

	    <!-- Sure, but this particular section is about the
	    -ORBClientConnectionHandler section.  We can certainly
	    mention that it is better to use the ST reactor. -->

              <!-- reactor instead of TP. BTW, shouldnt we interchange -->

	    <!-- The TP reactor was never mentioned here, so what the
                 issue? -->

              <!-- things here for example tell about RW and then go -->
              <!-- to ST handlers? -->

	    <!-- Fine with me Bala.  You know more about the this
                 option than I do.  Go for it!  :-)  -->

              <!-- No problem. I will start changing this once you -->
              <!-- make your next pass -->

	      to the list of <code>Client_Strategy_Factory</code>
	      options.  Other values for this option, such as
	      <code>RW</code>, are more appropriate for "pure"
	      synchronous clients.  See the <code>

		  -ORBClientConnectionHandler</a></code> option
	      documentation for details.

	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Low Client Scalability Requirements</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Clients with lower scalability requirements can dedicate a
	      connection to one request at a time, which means that no
              other requests or replies will be sent or received,
	      respectively, over that connection while a request is
              pending.  The connection is <i>exclusive</i> to a given
              request, thus reducing contention on a connection.
              However, that exclusivity
              <!-- Ossama, I am not sure I understand that using -->
              <!-- exclusive connections could lead to reduced -->
              <!-- throughput. As a matter of fact we have a cache map -->
              <!-- lookup on the client side for muxed and that would -->
              <!-- increase the latencies a bit :-). Exclusive takes -->
              <!-- more resources and that could leade reduced -->
              <!-- scalability, right?-->

	      <!-- Bala, isn't that what I said?  Paraphrasing what I
                   said, if the client has low scalability
                   requirements then exclusive connections can be used
                   to improve throughput.  Isn't that incorrect? -->

	      comes at the cost of a smaller number of requests that
	      may be issued at a given point in time.

              <!-- May be I am confused :-). The above statement that -->
              <!-- says "smaller number of requests"  tries to convey -->
              <!-- that we will have reduced throughput. What am I -->
              <!-- missing here? -->
              To enable this
	      behaviour, add the following option to the
	      <code>Client_Strategy_Factory</code> line of your
	      <code>svc.conf</code> file:
	    </p>

	    <blockquote>
	      <code>
		<a href="Options.html#-ORBTransportMuxStrategy">
		  -ORBTransportMuxStrategy</a> EXCLUSIVE
	      </code>
	    </blockquote>

	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <a name="server_throughput"></a>
    <h4>Optimizing Server Throughput</h4>

    <p>
      Throughput on the server side can be improved by configuring TAO
      to use a <i>thread-per-connection</i> concurrency model.  With
      this concurrency model, a single thread is assigned to service
      each connection.  That same thread is used to dispatch the
      request to the appropriate servant, meaning that thread context
      switching is kept to minimum.  To enable this concurrency model
      in TAO, add the following option to the
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#DefaultServer">Server_Strategy_Factory</a>
      </code>
      entry in your <code>svc.conf</code> file:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#orb_concurrency">
	  -ORBConcurrency</a> thread-per-connection
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      While the <i>thread-per-connection</i> concurrency model may
      improve throughput, it generally does not scale well due to
      limitations of the platform the application is running.  In
      particular, most operating systems cannot efficiently handle
      more than <code>100</code> or <code>200</code> threads running
      concurrently.  Hence performance often degrades sharply as the
      number of connections increases over those numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other concurrency models are further discussed in the
      <i><a href="#server_scalability">Optimizing Server
	  Scalability</a></i> section below.
    </p>

    <p><hr><p>

    <a name="scalability"></a>
    <h3>Optimizing Scalability</h3>

    <p>
      In this context, ``scalability'' refers to how well an ORB
      performs as the number of CORBA requests increases.  For
      example, a non-scalable configuration will perform poorly as the
      number of pending CORBA requests on the client increases from
      <code>10</code> to <code>1,000</code>, and similarly on the
      server.  ORB scalability is particularly important on the server
      since it must often handle many requests from multiple clients.
    </p>

    <a name="client_scalability"></a>
    <h4>Optimizing Client Scalability</h4>

    <p>
      In order to optimize TAO for scalability on the client side,
      connection multiplexing must be enabled.  Specifically, multiple
      requests may be issued and pending over the same connection.
      Sharing a connection in this manner reduces the amount of
      resources required by the ORB, which in turn makes more
      resources available to the application.  To enable this behavior
      use the following <code>Client_Strategy_Factory</code> option:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#-ORBTransportMuxStrategy">
	  -ORBTransportMuxStrategy</a> MUXED
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is the default setting used by TAO.
    </p>

    <a name="server_scalability"></a>
    <h4>Optimizing Server Scalability</h4>

    <p>
      Scalability on the server side depends greatly on the
      <i>concurrency model</i> in use.  TAO supports two concurrency
      models:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Reactive, and</li>
      <li>Thread-per-connection</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The thread-per-connection concurrency model is described above
      in the
      <i><a href="#server_throughput">Optimizing Server
	  Throughput</a></i>
      section.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>reactive</i> concurrency model employs the Reactor design
      pattern to demultiplex incoming CORBA requests.  The underlying
      event demultiplexing mechanism is typically one of the
      mechanisms provided by the operating system, such as the
      <code>select(2)</code> system call.  To enable this concurrency
      model, add the following option to the
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#DefaultServer">Server_Strategy_Factory</a>
      </code>
      entry in your <code>svc.conf</code> file:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#orb_concurrency">
	  -ORBConcurrency</a> reactive
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is the default setting used by TAO.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reactive concurrency model provides improved scalability on
      the server side due to the fact that less resources are used,
      which in turn allows a very large number of requests to be
      handled by the server side ORB.  This concurrency model provides
      much better scalability than the thread-per-connection model
      described above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further scalability tuning can be achieved by choosing a Reactor
      appropriate for your application.  For example, if your
      application is single-threaded then a reactor optimized for
      single-threaded use may be appropriate.  To select a
      single-threaded <code>select(2)</code> based reactor, add the
      following option to the
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#AdvancedResourceFactory">Advanced_Resource_Factory</a>
      </code>
      entry in your <code>svc.conf</code> file:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#-ORBReactorType">
	  -ORBReactorType</a> select_st
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If your application uses thread pools, then the thread pool
      reactor may be a better choice.  To use it, add the following
      option instead:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#-ORBReactorType">
	  -ORBReactorType</a> tp_reactor
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is TAO's default reactor.  See the
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#-ORBReactorType">-ORBReactorType</a>
      </code>
      documentation for other reactor choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that may have to link the <code>TAO_Strategies</code>
      library into your application in order to take advantage of the
      <code>
	<a href="Options.html#AdvancedResourceFactory">Advanced_Resource_Factory</a>
      </code>
      features, such as alternate reactor choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      A third concurrency model, <i>un</i>supported by TAO, is
      <i>thread-per-request</i>.  In this case, a single thread is
      used to service each request as it arrives.  This concurrency
      model generally provides neither scalability nor speed, which is
      the reason why it is often not used in practice.

    <h3>Reducing Compilation Time</h3>

    <a name="compile_optimization"></a>
    <h4>Compilation Optimization</h4>

When developing software that uses ACE+TAO you can reduce the time it
takes to compile your software by not enabling you compiler's optimizer
flags. These often take the form -O&lt;n&gt;.<P>

Disabling optimization for your application will come at the cost of run
time performance, so you should normally only do this during
development, keeping your test and release build optimized. <P>

    <a name="compile_inlinling"></a>
    <h4>Compilation Inlining</h4>

When compiler optimization is disabled, it is frequently the case that
no inlining will be performed. In this case the ACE inlining will be
adding to your compile time without any appreciable benefit. You can
therefore decrease compile times further by build building your
application with the -DACE_NO_INLINE C++ flag. <P>

In order for code built with -DACE_NO_INLINE to link, you will need to
be using a version of ACE+TAO built with the "inline=0" make flag. <P>

To accommodate both inline and non-inline builds of your application
it will be necessary to build two copies of your ACE+TAO libraries,
one with inlining and one without. You can then use your ACE_ROOT and
TAO_ROOT variables to point at the appropriate installation.<P>

    <h3>Reducing Memory Footprint</h3>

    <a name="compile_footprint"></a>
    <h4>Compile-time Footprint</h4>

It has also been observed recently that using -xO3 with -xspace on SUN
CC 5.x compiler gives a big footprint reduction of the order of 40%.</P>
<P>Also footprint can be saved by specifying the following in your
platform_macros.GNU file: </P>
<P>
<code>
<pre>
optimize=1
debug=0
CPPFLAGS += -DACE_USE_RCSID=0 -DACE_NLOGGING=1
</pre>
</code>

<P>
If portable interceptors aren't needed, code around line 729 in
<code>$TAO_ROOT/tao/orbconf.h</code> can be modified to hard-code
<code>TAO_HAS_INTERCEPTORS</code> as <code>0</code>, and all interceptor
code will be skipped by the preprocessor.

    time.
  <tr>
    <td><code>-Sa</code>
    <td>Suppresses generation of Any insertion/extraction operators. If
    the application IDL contains no Anys, and the application itself
    doesn't use them, this can be a useful option.
  <tr>
    <td><code>-St</code>
    <td>Suppresses type code generation. Since Anys depend on type codes,
    this option will also suppress the generation of Any operators. Usage
    requires the same conditions as for the suppression of Any operators,
    plus no type codes in application IDL and no application usage of
    generated type codes.
  <tr>
    <td><code>-GA</code>
    <td>Generates type code and Any operator definitions into a separate
    file with a 'A' suffix just before the <code>.cpp</code> extension.
    This is a little more flexible and transparent than using <code>-Sa</code> or
    <code>-St</code> if you are compiling to DLLs or shared objects,
    since the code in this file won't get linked in unless it's used.
  <tr>
    <td><code>-Sp</code>
    <td>Suppresses the generation of extra classes used for thru-POA
    collocation optimization. If the application has no collocated
    client/server pairs, or if the performance gain from collocation
    optimization is not important, this option can be used.
  <tr>
    <td><code>-H dynamic_hash</code><br>
        <code>-H binary_search</code><br>
        <code>-H linear_search</code><br>
    <td>Generates alternatives to the default code generated on
    the skeleton side for operation dispatching (which uses perfect
    hashing). These options each give a small amount of footprint
    reducion, each amount slightly different, with a corresponding tradeoff
    in speed of operation dispatch.
