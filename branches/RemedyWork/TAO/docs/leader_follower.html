	<h1>Leader follower model for global resources</h1>
	<HR>
	  <h2>Context</h2>
	  Global resources in TAO mean one ORB and using the reactive strategy
	  one Reactor. TAO uses the ACE Select Reactor for this purpose. 
	  One main problem with multithreading and only one Reactor is that
	  only one thread can wait in handle_events at a time. 
	  Handle_events is called, when a thread expects input, meaning
	  it is blocking to wait for it.
	  
	  <h2>Idea</h2>
	  One solution to this problem is to use a leader-follower model,
	  which partitions the set of threads wanting to wait for input
	  into one leader and followers. Every thread is eligible to become
	  a leader. A thread wanting to wait while nobody else is waiting
	  becomes the leader. If the leader gets its input, which is in
	  this case its response, it will select a new leader out of the 
	  set of followers. The followers wait on a condition variable they
	  own and register it with the ORB core. The ORB core is thereby
	  responsible for making this access thread-save by providing
	  a lock for the list of followers with some flags, like
	  leader_available.
	  
	  <h2>Implementation</h2>
	  The above mentioned condition variables are owned by the 
	  connection handlers, because reponses are expected per connection,
	  not necessarily, thinking about other resource models, per thread.
	  <p>
	    The involved classes are TAO_ORB_Core, TAO_Client_Connection_Handler
	    and TAO_ORB. In the TAO_ORB_Core class the list of followers, a lock,
	    a leader reference counter and a leader thread ID were added.
	    The handle_input and send_request methods on the TAO_Client_Connection_Handler
	    contain 95% of the code used for implementing the leader-follower
	    model. Care has to be taken, that the connection handlers are 
	    suspended and resumed, properly. A special concern is that
	    no deadlocking occurs.
