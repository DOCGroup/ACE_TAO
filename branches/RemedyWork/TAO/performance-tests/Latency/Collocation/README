/**

@page Collocation Performance Test README File

	This test estimates the minimum latency for a twoway
request when both client and server are collocated.  The test uses a single 
threaded client and server, and configures the ORB to eliminate common sources 
of overhead, such as locking. Further, this test uses the default collocation
strategy in TAO, i.e. "thru_poa".

	Please do not extend this test to deal with other data types,
configurations, etc.  If you need to just create a new test.  In the
past we had multi-purpose tests like that, they were hard to maintain,
and the results were hard to interpret.  Furthermore, the test is
purposely simple so its output can be parsed via nightly scripts and
plotted in a graph.   More importantly, the overhead of marshaling is
better measures using an isolated test, that does not involve the
network.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful, and prints
out the performance numbers.
