In order to regenerate the data files, you will need to perform the
following steps:

1) Instrument TAO_Transport to write a copy of each data block into a file
that was read from a socket by applying Transport.patch.

2) Temporarily change ../Java_Big_Request/client.java to send only 2
requests.

3) Run the server from PMB_With_Fragments and the java client from
../Java_Big_Request.

Start the server:

server -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost:11000 -o ../Java_Big_Request/server.ior

Then run the java client:

java client

4) Move the generated data file to the correct name.
