// $Id$

The scenario for this test is the following.

The client:

- makes a first request to the server, the send_request interception point does nothing
- receives a reply, receive_reply interception point called -> *OK*
- makes another request, the send_request interception point forwards it to the server IOR
- receives a reply, receive_reply interception point called -> *OK*
- makes a third request, the send_request interception does nothing

At this point server is instructed to throw an exception.

If the server throws one exception in the following set
*COMM_FAILURE*
*TRANSIENT*
*NO_RESPONSE*
*OBJ_ADAPTER*
with completion status *COMPLETED_NO* the client's *receive_other* interception point is
called *with an invalid ClientRequestInfo object*. Reading this object will result in a
BAD_INV_ORDER exception to be raised with minor code of 1330446350.

If the server throws any other exception, the receive_exception interception point is
called as expected.
