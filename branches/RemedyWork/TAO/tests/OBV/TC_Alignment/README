	This is a test of the traversal of the typecode tree for valuetypes.
Specifically, elements of the valuetypes typecode that are respresent CORBA
Short values, for example the value modifier, have been known to cause errors
when traversing the typecode tree if the previous quantity inserted (in this
case the repository id) has left the write pointer with an odd offset from
an 8-byte boundary. This problem has been fixed - the test is to ensure that
the problem does not recur as a result of future changes to the TAO TypeCode
class.

        Four valuetypes are declared in an IDL file, named in such a way
that their repository IDs (including the terminal null byte) have lengths
of 25, 27, 29, and 31. The test method is called 4 times. In each call,
one of these valuetypes is inserted into an Any and returned to the client,
who extracts it from the Any and checks the state member for the
correct value.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

The script returns 0 if the test was successful.

The command line option -d turns on debugging information for any
errors that may occur. The script will automatically shut down the
server by means of a client call. If the test is run by hand, this
will not happen automatically - the command line option -x must be
passed to the client.
