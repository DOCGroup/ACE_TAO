This test checks that a shmiop corbaloc reference can be parsed correctly and connected correctly. It uses the NameService and nslist because they are compatible already built pairing of client and server. Their use is not relevent otherwise. This would work just as well with hello world. This is actually a test for TAO/tao/Strategies *not* TAO/orbsvcs but as it uses the NS it's here rather than in TAO/tests.

The name service is started with only a shmiop endpoint on a random port and the -ORBObjRefStyle URL directive is used to make the IOR that is exported be in the corbaloc form. nslist is used to query the service using this IOR.

shmiop must (of course) be available.

Regression output looks like:

C:\worcvs\tao151\prism\tests\tao470_regression>run_test.pl
(3252|1076) EXCEPTION, Exception in nslist
system exception, ID 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/OBJECT_NOT_EXIST:1.0'
Unknown vendor minor code id (0), minor code = 0, completed = NO

ERROR: Regression - nslist returned
INFO: ../../../TAO/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service being killed.

... or indeed anything that doesn't look like the success output which is:
