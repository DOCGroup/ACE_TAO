@page EndpointPolicy+SSLIOP Test README File

  This test validates a fix for the use of SSLIOP with the endpoint policy.
  The problem is ducumented in bugzilla #2868, an is manifest when the TAO
  EndpointPolicy is used to filter endpoints on a POA when the ORB is using
  SSLIOP. This test prepares a server that starts with 2 SSLIOP enabled
  listen endpoints. Then endpoint are generated, you do not need to pass
  them in the command.  then uses the Endpoint Policy to constrain a POA to
  use only one of those. The test only requires a server. When successful,
  the program will exit right away. On failure, the program will be stuck
  in an infinite loop and must be killed by the run_test script. The server
  outputs its IOR so that manual inspection using catior can confirm that
  the generated IOR indeed contains only a single endpoint but that is not
  necessary for determining correctness of the test.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  or start the test executable manually:

$ ./test -o <iorfile> -p <port>
