In the early days of the DDS4CCM specification a topic name was not changable.
When it was set (doesn't matter if it was a late binded topic), the user was not
allowed to change it, otherwise a NonChangeable exception was thrown.

The requirement from the field dictates that a topic name should be changeable.
When the topic name will be set a second time, the connector should shut down
DDS and start it again, using the new topic name. The connector does not tear
down the proxies. This means that the connector doesn't change on the outside.

The ReadGet test has the following sequence:
1. Sender starts writing samples for TopicI
2. Sender informs the Receiver that samples has been written for TopicI
3. Receiver sets this topic name on his connector (late binding), and starts to
   collect the samples.
4. Sender resets the topic name to TopicII and informs the receiver about this.
5. Receiver resets the topic name on his connector and starts collecting the
   samples belonging to TopicII.

Both listeners tests (UpdateListen and WriteListen) have about the same sequence:
1. Sender and Receiver start, writing and listening to the same topic.
2. After 10 second, the perl script starts two small executables; one to inform
   the receiver to switch to topic II and one to inform the sender to switch to
   topic II. The executables are spawned in this order.
3. Step one is repeated.
4. Step two will be repeated.

The ToEmpty test will initially start writing samples for TopicI. After a while,
the topic name will be cleared. This means that the connector internally stops DDS.
After another while, the sender will start writing samples again,
but now for TopicII. This sequence repeats.
