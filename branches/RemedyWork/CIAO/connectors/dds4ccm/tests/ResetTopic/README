In the early days of the DDS4CCM specification a topic name was not changable.
When it was set (doesn't matter if it was a late binded topic), the user was not
allowed to change it, otherwise a NonChangeable exception was thrown.

The requirement from the field dictates that a topic name should be changeable.
When the topic name will be set a second time, the connector should shut down
DDS and start it again, using the new topic name. The connector does not tear
down the proxies. This means that the connector doesn't change on the outside.

The ReadGet test has the following sequence:
1. Sender writes samples for topic 1 (iteration 1 -10)
2. Sender informs the receiver that samples for topic 1 were written to DDS
3. Receiver sets the topic name (late binding), and starts to read.
4. Sender writes samples for topic 2 (iteration 11 - 20)
5. Sender informs the receiver that samples for topic 2 were written to DDS
6. Receiver sets the topic name to topic 2. At this moment, the connector will
   restart DDS.
7. Receiver reads the samples from DDS.
