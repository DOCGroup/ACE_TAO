        * connectors/ami4ccm/tutorials/Hello/Hello_asm/ports/Hello_MyFoo_obj.mpc:
          Fixed compile errors related to the movement of the facet
          servants.

        * ciao/Servants/Extension/Servant_Impl_T.h:
          Added missing include.

        * connectors/ami4ccm/examples/Hello/Base/Hello.mpc:
          Removed -Gsv IDL compiler flag.

        * ciao/Servants/Facet_Servant_Base_T.h:
        * ciao/Servants/Session/Servant_Impl_T.h:
          Added some necessary includes.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/idl/dds4ccm_stub.mpc:
          Removed -Glem for generation of dds4ccm_entity.idl
          and ccm_dds.idl since it was not necessary to create
          the local executor mapping (at least, the generated
          files were not compiled)

Mon Dec  5 18:41:32 UTC 2011  Marcel Smit  <msmit@remedy.nl>

        * connectors/dds4ccm/idl/dds4ccm_stub.mpc:
          Removed -Glem since it was added a second time. At that point
          dds4ccm_QueryFilter was generated with -Glem
          (which is not necessary).

        * ciao/Servants/Session/Servant_Impl_T.h:
        * ciao/Servants/Session/Servant_Impl_T.cpp:
          Added _T to templated classes. This fixes compile error
          since the IDL compiler was already prepared for this.

        * tests/IDL_Test/Inherited_Component/Extended/Base.idl:
          Let derived_interface derive from the base_interface.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/idl/dds4ccm_stub.mpc:
          Prevent compilation after invoking make for a second time

        * ciao/Contexts/Session/Session_Context_T.h:
        * ciao/Contexts/Session/Session_Context_T.cpp:
          Renamed class, using _T postfix.

        * tests/IDL_Test/Inherited_Component/Extended/Base.idl:
        * tests/IDL_Test/Inherited_Component/Extended/Derived.idl:
          Expanded.
