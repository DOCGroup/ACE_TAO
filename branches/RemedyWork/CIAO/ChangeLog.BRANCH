        * ciao/Deployment/Interceptors/Deployment_Interceptors.h:
        * ciao/Deployment/Interceptors/Deployment_Interceptors.cpp:

          Changed basic CIAO_ReferenceLookup_i to attempt handling resolving
          externalReference endpoints as CORBA IOR type references.
          Added factory method for creating interceptor.

        * tests/DAnCE/ExecutionManager-Deployments/run_test.pl:

          Change to allow overruling CIAO_LOG_LEVEL from commandline.
