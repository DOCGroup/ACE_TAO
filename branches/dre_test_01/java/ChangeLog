	* EAC/System Manual.doc:
	* EAC/System_Manual.doc:
	  Another file with spaces in the name, awful for scripts!

        * java/EAC/User Manual.doc:
        * java/EAC/User_Manual.doc:
          Renamed documentation file, many a script gets confused with
          names that have spaces in them.

          Added in missing CVS Id strings.

        * src/*, tests/*, netsvcs/*: Implemented major changes to the
          package system.  Now all files descend from the JACE directory
          under the main archive level.  All files are further grouped by
          their subpackage names.  This is the way Java usually wants it,
          and makes JACE javadoc friendly.

          Rewrote and added javadoc comments throughout JACE.

          Changed all concurrency mechanisms to inherit from AbstractLock,
          obeying all its requirements such as not releasing the lock
          unless the accessing thread is the owner.

          Added the token service.

          Added and rewrote tests for Concurrency mechs and ServiceConfig.

          Rewrote network services to inherit from JACE.netsvcs.Server and
          JACE.netsvcs.Handler, abstracting much of the work out to these
          base classes.

          Debugging is now OFF by default.

Wed Aug 18 19:43:23 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/GetOpt.java: Added another constructor to GetOpt with an
          option to return args even if not in the optstring.  This is
          useful for the default case in a switch (for printUsage
          and exit).

Wed Aug 18 13:35:46 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/TimerQueue.java: Now when createInternalThread is specified
          in the constructor, it is set to be a daemon thread.  Thus, if a
          TimerQueue thread is the only one executing, the VM exits.

        * src/StrategyAcceptor.java, AcceptStrategy.java
          StrategyAcceptor now inherits from Acceptor.  AcceptStrategy
          can now delegate to an Acceptor, rather than having its own
          SOCKAcceptor.  Its default is to delegate to a generic
          Acceptor instance (that uses a SOCKAcceptor).

        * src/Acceptor.java, TimeValue.java
          Solved a few javadoc warnings.

Fri Jul 09 11:08:32 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/TimedWait.java, Stream*.java, Token.java
          Fixed a bug in TimedWait from the recent changes.  Made
          Streams (and Modules) use absolute times for timeouts.

Thu Jul 08 14:54:36 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/Condition.java, TimedWait.java, EventHandler.java,
          MessageQueue.java, ServiceObject.java, SvcHandler.java,
          Task.java, Mutex.java, Semaphore.java, Token.java,
          TimerQueue.java

          Changed the semantics of Condition, TimedWait, MessageQueue,
          Task, Mutex, Semaphore, and Token to use absolute times for
          their timeouts.

          Changed the semantics of EventHandler, ServiceObject, and
          SvcHandler such that handleTimeout receives a TimeValue
          representing when the event occured.

          Changed TimerQueue internally to reflect the above changes.

          Also made better checks in Token and Mutex so that non-owners
          can call release without adverse effects.  I plan to try to
          do this with Semaphore and RWMutex as well.

Thu Jul 08 11:20:17 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/TimeValue.java: Added relativeTimeOfDay(offsets)
          methods which return TimeValues.  These should help people
          since many classes will be changed to use
          absolute TimeValues shortly to correspond to ACE's versions.

Wed Jul 07 22:42:27 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/Token.java: Fixed several bugs in tryacquire and renew.
        Specifying a null TimeValue in acquire or renew now means to wait
        until the lock is obtained.  Specifying TimeValue.zero in acquire
        means just to poll and don't call sleepHook().  In renew, it is
        the same as specifying a requePosition of 0 -- doesn't give up
        the token.

Wed Jul 07 21:54:35 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * src/TimedWait.java: Fixed the semantics of
          timedWait(TimeValue tv).  Now when tv represents zero, it has
          polling semantics, checking the condition once and returning
          on success or throwing a TimeoutException on failure.  Before,
          it blocked until notified.  (Also affects synch mechanisms)

Reset the ChangeLog file for future users.  If anyone wants more complete
file by file changes, they can be provided with the CVS log command.

Updated the JACE page at http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~eea1/JACE.html to reflect
the Version 1.4.4 changes, which included:

* Removed CUP and JLex from JACE.  The java_cup directory is still in CVS,
  but won't be included in future versions.  This means that the option to
  load C++ ACE ServiceConfigurator files is gone.

* Changed the SOCKStream system so it uses DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
  to maintain compatibility with other languages and remove the deprecation
  warnings from using PrintStream.  (Can't use Reader/Writers since they
  write 16-bit chars not 8-bit bytes)

* Made lots of modifications to comments and code to remove javadoc warnings
  and deprecation warnings.  They were all straight-forward changes such as
  making sure a @throws line was in the comments for all exceptions a method
  had, etc.
