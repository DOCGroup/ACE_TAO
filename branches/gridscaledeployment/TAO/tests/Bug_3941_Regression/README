The problem is described in the corresponding issue. In short tao_idl
incorrectly generated _tao_unmarshal() function for valuetypes so that
it returned true even when the types stored in CDR and attempted to
extract were completely different.


__Successful Output__

$> ./run_test.pl
Test passed.


__Regression Output__

$> ./run_test.pl
ERROR: unmarshal shouldn't work
ERROR: <test3941> failed:
ERROR: test returned 255
