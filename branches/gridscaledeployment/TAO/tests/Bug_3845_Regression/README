@page Local/Remote Mismatch Test README File

	This test does not use the C++ compiler or any binaries
	from another test. It simply runs the IDL compiler on
	the IDL files, using the perl script, which returns
	successfully if it catches the expected error. If the
	expected error is not returned by the IDL compiler,
	the script itself returns an error.

	In each of the 4 IDL files:

	local_inarg.idl
	local_inoutarg.idl
	local_outarg.idl
	local_rettype.idl

	there is an IDL error in which a local interface is used as
	the indicated part of the signature of an operation on a
	non-local interface. If the error were not caught in the
	IDL compiler, it would turn up as a C++ compiler error
	(since CDR operators are not generated for local interfaces)
	or, worse, a runtime error.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
