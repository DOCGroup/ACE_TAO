This is a unit test for RTCORBA::SERVER_DECLARED priority model.

Scenario:
---------

The server creates a POA with RTCORBA::SERVER_DECLARED priority model
policy.  Two objects are created using this POA, one inherits the POA
priority and the second one overrides POA priority with its own.
Server threadpool resources are configured appropriately.

The client obtains two object references and invokes a method on each
several times.  On each invocation, the client passes object's server
declared priority as operation argument.  This allows the servant to
check that appropriate resources are being used for servicing client
requests.  In particular, servant checks that priority of the thread
used for servicing the request equals to the server declared priority
of the object, known from the operation argument.

See run_test.pl for instructions on how to run both this test.
