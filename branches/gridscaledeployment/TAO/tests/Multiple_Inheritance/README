This module is used as a test for IDL interfaces that inherit from
multiple interfaces.  The "diamond of death" inheritance hierarchy is
used in this example where there is a common base class (A), two
classes deriving from the common base class (B and C) and then a final
derived class (D) that inherits from both B and C.

The client starts off with CORBA Object, narrows to interface A, then
B, then C, and finally D. It calls all the methods on each interface.

Run the server without arguments.  Then use the IOR generated by the
server to run the client:

client -k <ior>

You should get the following output:

method1
method1
method2
method1
method3
method1
method2
method3
method4
