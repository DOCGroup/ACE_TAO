@page Callback Test README File

  This is a test to test client callbacks in various IP connection setups.

  - run_test.pl tests the default endpoint setup;

  - run_test_ipv6.pl tests the situation where both
    server and client are forced to use only IPv6
    endpoints;

  - run_test_mixed_ip.pl tests the situation where the server is forced to
    use an IPv6 endpoint and the client an IPv4 endpoint.

	To run the test use the run_testXXX.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
