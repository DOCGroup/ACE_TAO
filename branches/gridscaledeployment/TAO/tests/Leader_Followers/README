Description:

This is a test for server applications that have client threads
(threads making remote calls) starting before event loop threads
(threads running the event loop).

Expected output:

The event loop threads should wait for the client threads that become
leaders to give up leadership before continuing.

How to run:

You can use the run_test.pl script to run it or:

$ server
$ client
