This test provides regression for Bug 1635:
"Enhancement - provide date and time stamping to the TAO log file"

The fix allows the setting of a system property that results in a date and time stamp being applied to all ACE log messages.

The client program merely initialises and destroys an ORB - enough activity to prompt the writing of debug messages. The run_test.pl checks the debug output produced for timestamps.
