	The simplest possible test BUG 1020 regression for TAO.  This
is a very simple test for TAO.


        The test does the following

- A server waits for a request from the client

- The client sends a request with a reference to the object that it
  has instantiated and registered with the POA. The client in addiiotn
  creates 4 threads to run the ORB event loop.

- The server on receiving the request in the main thread creates 4
  more threads and starts making invocation on the client using the
  reference it got from the client.

- The client threads after processing a few invocation abort, there by
  crashing the client.

- The server should survive the crash

- The test passes sequence<octet> between client and server in either
  direction with the purpose of ensuring that the tranport gets flow
  controlled.

To run the test

$ ./server -o file_name
$ while /bin/true; ./client -k file://file_name; done;

The client will run in a loop, crash and get started again. The server
should just survive

The test doesnt stress the server by having more than one client and
crashing all of them. There is another test that tests that
scenario. Hence please dont add that capability to this test.
