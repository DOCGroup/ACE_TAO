Case
----

This test creates a distributed DT ie. a DT that spans multiple
hosts/processes. In this test they span two hosts/processes. The DT on
one host/process makes a remote invocation on another host/process and
hence executes in the context of the second host/process before
returning to the first host/process. The DT makes a one-way and a
two-way invocations. In a one-way invocation a new DT is created to
continue servicing the request. In the case of a two-way invocation
the same DT executes on the second host/process.

The DT information is propagated across hosts/processes via the
service contexts. The service context is populated with the DT info
using the Client Interceptor when sending a request. The DT info is
retreived from the service context on the server using the Server
Interceptor when receiving the request.

This test also illustrates the propagation of the
CORBA::THREAD_CANCELLED exception to the point of origin of the DT
when it is cancelled on a remote host/process it is currently
executing in.

To Run
------

Start the following processes in that order.

./test_server -f <ior_filename>

-f <ior_filename> --> Name of the file in which the server IOR will be written


./test_client -f <ior_filename>

-f <ior_filename> --> Name of the file in which the server IOR was written
