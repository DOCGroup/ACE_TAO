Case
----

This is a test for forking new DTs from existing DTs using
Current::spawn (). A local DT is created with
Current::begin_scheduling_segment() and
Current::end_scheduling_segment (). A new DT is spawned within the
context of the DT created. The Thread_Action::do () method is called
when the spawned DT is activated. This method provides a point of
entry for the spawned DT.

This test also shows that the DT spawn should be made only within the
context of another DT.
