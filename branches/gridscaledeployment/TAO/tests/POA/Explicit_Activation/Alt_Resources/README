This module shows how to modify the default TAO Resource Factory to do
something user specific.  In this example, the reactor() accessor is
modified to provide the ORB with an instance of the ACE_WFMO_Reactor
instead of the regular ACE_Select_Reactor.  You could also configure
the ACE_XtReactor here, as well.

To use this altered resource factory in the Explicit_Activation
example, please specify the -ORBsvcconf alternate.conf as a additional
parameter to the server at start up.

Note: Use of WFMO_Reactor is only for demonstration. In general,
WFMO_Reactor will not work for TAO as it cannot handle nested call
correctly.  Also, since WFMO_Reactor is limited to Win32, this example
is limited to Win32.
