C++ mapping says that "For bounded sequences, the maximum length is part of the
type and cannot be set or modified..." and later "For a bounded sequence,
maximum() always returns the bound of the sequence as given in its OMG IDL type
declaration."

Also it says that "For a bounded sequence, attempting to set the current length
to a value larger than the maximum length given in the OMG IDL specification
produces undefined behavior".
