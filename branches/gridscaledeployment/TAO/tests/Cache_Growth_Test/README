@page Cache Grow Test README File

        This test is to make sure that we close the cache entries
	properly when the clients are disconnected. The test does
	something really simple. Infact it is a copy of the Hello
	test. But in this test we connect multiple clients to the
	server to make sure that our cache size does not grow.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
