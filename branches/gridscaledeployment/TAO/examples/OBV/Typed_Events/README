Typed Events
============

This is a demonstration of the CORBA 2.3 valuetype feature.
Event_Types.idl defines a hierarchy of event classes. The common
attributes (indeed not CORBA attributes, they're state members) like
creation time and id of the origin are in a base class.  Concrete
events like Temperature, Position and Log Message are derived from
this class.

The client sends a few random events to the server. The server has
suitable implementations of the event classes. So it is able to show
the incoming events by invoking the do_print () operation, which is
declared in the Event baseclass.  After that the server does an
"alarm" check on the event.  For each possible origin id (KITCHEN,
BATHROOM) a criterion has been registered. The criterion which equals
the origin id of the event is searched and then asked with is_critical
(event).

Finally a list with all the events which causes an alarm is requested
by the client.

Start with:

% ./server -o ior
% ./client -f ior [-x]
