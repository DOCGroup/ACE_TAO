Performance tests for the performance of the DIOP
implementation using oneways in a roundtrip manor.
This means that the client sends a request to the server,
which in turn sends a request to the client.

1000 oneway requests containing a sequence of 256 chars are
performed and the average time per call is measured.

To execute the test either

- use run_test.pl, or

- start

   server -o ior -ORBendpoint diop://:12345

   client -k file://ior
