The consumer may specify 'and' and/or 'or' relations on the filterable data
contained within an event.

follows:

$ ./Sequence_Supplier
usage:  ./Sequence_Supplier -o <iorfile> -e <# of events>

$ ./Sequence_Consumer -\?
usage:  ./Sequence_Consumer -k <ior> -l <low expected events>
                            -h <high expected events>

To run this test, run the run_test.pl perl script.
This script is designed to test various aspects of the filtering
