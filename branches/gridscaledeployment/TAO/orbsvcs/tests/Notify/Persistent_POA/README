Notification Persistent POA Test
================================

Description
-----------

This test exercises the persistent POA used to create the
NotifyEventChannelFactory.  It uses the Blocking test consumer and a
modified version of the Blocking test supplier to do so.

The first notify service is started, the supplier creates an event channel,
the first notify service is killed and a new one is started on the same
host/port combination.  The supplier then creates a new event channel (using
the IOR of the old notify service) and the consumer is started.

Usage
-----

To run this test, just run the run_test.pl perl script.  It will run both
structured and sequence tests with each of the implemented discard policies.


Expected Results
----------------
If there is any message with the word ERROR in it, then the test has failed.
Otherwise, the test was ok.
