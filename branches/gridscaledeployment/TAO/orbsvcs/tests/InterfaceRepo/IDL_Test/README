This directory runs the IFR compiler on the various IDL compiler
stress tests found in $TAO_ROOT/tests/IDL_Test.  It will automatically
pick up new IDL files as they are added.

The testing goes in three phases:

1. Test general parsing, IFR info generation and IFR info removal,
   ignoring any issues which may arise due to duplicate symbols/RIDs.

   For each IDL file {
     run the IFR
     tao_ifr on the IDL file
     tao_ifr on the IDL file to remove from the IFR
     terminate the IFR
   }

   FAILURE CONDITIONS:
   (a) IFR crashes
   (b) IFR does not get the correct information
   (c) IFR does not remove the correct information
   (d) tao_ifr crashes
   (e) tao_ifr fails

2. Test general parsing, IFR info generation and IFR info removal
   across the entire set of IDL files, allowing issues which may arise
   due to duplicate symbols/RIDs to come to light.

   Run the IFR
   For each IDL file {
     skip the IDL file if the IDL file is known to fail in #1
     tao_ifr on the IDL file
   }

   For each IDL file {
     skip the IDL file if the IDL file is known to fail in #1
     tao_ifr on the IDL file to remove from the IFR
   }

3. Repeat #2, but using the "-Si" option.
