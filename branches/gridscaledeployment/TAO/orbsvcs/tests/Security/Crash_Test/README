This test verifies that the ORB's connection management mechanism is
functioning properly while using SSLIOP as inter-orb protocol.
It does so by doing the following:

	- Starting server with persisten POA.

	- Starting client which makes series of invocations using
	  SSLIOP.

	- Crashing the server.

	- The client waits for the server to come back and
	  tries to connect using the same IOR.

To run the test simply execute run_test.pl
