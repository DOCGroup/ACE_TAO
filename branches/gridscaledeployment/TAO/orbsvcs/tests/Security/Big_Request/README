Additional modifications (simplifications, improvements, etc) were
made by the DOC Group prior to inclusion in the TAO distribution.

This test excercises the ability of the SSLIOP pluggable protocol to
send very large requests and replies.  It is intended to make the ORB
send the message and reply in multiple parts (e.g. chains in a message
block that fill several elements of an "iovec" vector to be sent
through a scatter write/send interface).  In particular, it is
difficult to completely reproduce the semantics of the writev() system
call with SSL_write().  As such, if the semantics are not emulated
properly, large requests and replies will fail.

All that is really done is to send a 3MB octet sequence as an "in"
argument, and receive the same 3MB octet sequence from the server
through an "out" argument.

The expected test output is the following:

==== Running SSLIOP Big_Request test
Activated as <IOR:010000001200000049...0a410>
Sending  octet sequence of length:	3461724
Received octet sequence of length:	3461724
Sending  octet sequence of length:	3461724
Received octet sequence of length:	3461724

Event loop finished.

SSLIOP Big_Request test passed.
