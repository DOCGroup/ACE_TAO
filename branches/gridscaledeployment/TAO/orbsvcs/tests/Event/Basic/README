	Basic tests for the real-time event channel.

This directory contains several tests to exercise the real-time event
channel features, debug it and stress test it. The tests are as simple
as possible, but not simpler.

	Here are some canonical test configurations:

# Connect 100 suppliers, 100 consumers. Then disconnect and connect
# one particular consumer, 100. Then do the same for one supplier

$ Reconnect -verbose -suppliers 100 -consumers 100 -d 100

# Same as above, but instead of disconnecting and connecting again
# simply reconnect. Should be faster
$ Reconnect -verbose -suppliers 100 -consumers 100 -d 100 -c -s

# Connect 10 suppliers, 10 consumers and then shutdown the EC
$ Shutdown -verbose -suppliers 5 -consumer 5

# Create 4 event channels, connect all of them using IIOP gateways,
# then attach 5 consumers and 2 supplier to each, next generate 10000
# events (each supplier on its own thread).  It randomly connect and
# disconnects the consumers, hence the gateways also do.

$ Observer -ORBsvcconf observer.conf \
  -consumer_tshift 0 -supplier_tshift 0 \
  -suppliers 2 -consumers 5 \
  -channels 4 -burstsize 1000 -burstcount 10 \
  -burstpause 0 -busyhwm 1024 -maxwritedelay 1024

# Create an event channel in a configuration that informs the
# scheduler of the dependencies between consumers and suppliers.
# THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

$ Schedule -ORBsvcconf sched.conf -suppliers 5 -consumers 5

NOTES

	Don't worry about the "incomplete data" warning, it is a
deffect in the test.
