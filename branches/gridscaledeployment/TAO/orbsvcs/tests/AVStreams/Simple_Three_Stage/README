Description
-----------

This directory contains a simple three stage AV test:
a. Sender
b. Distributer
c. Receiver

The sender reads data read from a file and sends it to the distributer
process. The distributer acts as a conduit. It receives data from the
sender and sends it immediately to the receiver process.

The sender and receiver register their references with the Naming
Service.  The distributer gets the sender and receiver references from
the Naming Service.  It then binds to the receiver and sender. When
the connection between the distributer and sender is set up the sender
starts sending to the distributer which in turn sends data to the
receiver. When the sender has finished reading the file it tells the
ditributer which in turn tells the recveiver to destroy the streams
set up.


Running the test
----------------

Start the Naming Service

Start the following processes in the same order.

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-r <data_rate>]

-f filename  --> The name of the file from which data needs to be sent

-r data_rate --> The rate at which the data needs to be paced.


receiver

receiver [-f <filename>]

-f filename --> File into which the data received from the distributer is stored.
