Description
-----------

This directory contains a simple test in the form of a sender and a
receiver.  The test has the following features:

1. It tests the AVStreams Pluggable Protocol Framework
2. Shows a mechanism to pace data.

A new flow protocol called Time Stamp Flow Protocol is plugged into the AV Streams Framework
using the Pluggable Protocol Framework and the ACE Service Configurator. This new protocol
is compiled into a library and loaded when the AVStreams framework is initialized. When a
frame is sent this protocol appends a timestamp to the data being sent.

Running the test
----------------

receiver
--------

receiver -f <output_filename>

-f <output_filename> -> The name of the file under which the received stream
                        data has to be stored (defaults to "output")

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-p <protocol>] [-r <frame rate>] [-d]


-f filename --> The file to be streamed to the receiver (defaults to
                "input").

-p protocol --> The protocol string could be UDP or TCP (defaults to
                UDP). But with the multicast address it should be UDP.

-r framerate--> The rate at which tha data frames need to be sent
                (defaults to 30 frames per second).

-d          --> Increament the TAO_debug_level for debug messages.


The test must be run with the naming service.  Check the run_test.pl
to see how to configure the test case.
