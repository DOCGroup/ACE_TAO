Description
-----------

This directory contains a simple test in the form of a sender and a
receiver.  The test has the following features:

1. It tests the AVStreams Pluggable Protocol Framework
2. Shows a mechanism to pace data.
3. Records the inter-frame arrival time and dumps the results
in the Stats.dat file.

Running the test
----------------

The test must be run with the naming service.  Check the run_test.pl
to see how to configure the test case.

receiver
--------

receiver -f <output_filename> -s <stats_file>

-f <output_filename> -> The name of the file under which the received stream
                        data has to be stored (defaults to "output")

-s <stats_file>      -> File in which the frame inter-arrival time is recorded. Default name
                        is Stats.dat

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-p <protocol>] [-r <frame rate>] [-l <local_address>] [-a <peer_address>] [-s <# of frames sent>] [-b <frame size>] [-d]

-f filename --> The file to be streamed to the receiver (defaults to
                "input").

-p protocol --> The protocol string could be UDP, TCP, RTP/UDP or SCTP_SEQ (defaults to
                UDP). But with the multicast address it should be UDP.

-r framerate--> The rate at which tha data frames need to be sent
                (defaults to 30 frames per second).

-l address  --> Local address in the format host:port. If protocol is SCTP_SEQ then specify ","
		separated secondary addresses.eg. primary_addr:port,sec_addr1,sec_addr2

-a address  --> Destination address in the format host:port. If protocol is SCTP_SEQ then specify ","
		separated secondary addresses.eg. primary_addr:port,sec_addr1,sec_addr2

-s frames   --> The number of frames to be sent from the sender to the receiver. The
   sent         max frames that can be sent is 1000000 frames.

-b frame    --> The size of each frame sent in bytes.
   size

-d          --> Increment the TAO_debug_level for debug messages.
