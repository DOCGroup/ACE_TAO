$Id$

This application tests the implementation of the CosNaming::NamingContextExt
interface.

To run the test automatically -
	execute Perl script run_test.pl

To run tests manually -
	start the Naming Service (see
	TAO/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/README for valid options),
	then run ./client with one of the options below.

NOTE: if running tests manually, Naming Service has to be restarted
before each test (this is due to the test not 'cleaning up' bindings
after themselves).

The following options exist:
----------------------------

-o 	Run the client so that output is printed.

If no option is specified, the test is run and no output is printed.

DESCRIPTION AND EXPECTED OUTPUT
===============================

Performs the to_string, to_name (), to_url () and resolve_str () methods on
the given Name or stringified name.

Expected Output:

	If the -o option is specified, prints out the outputs of the
to_string (), to_name () and to_url () functions. If no option is specified,
completes with no output.
