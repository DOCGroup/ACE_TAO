This program tests the behavior of FT aware client when there
is a fault in the server.

First, you can test the behavior of client when it works with
a simple single profile IOR (not IOGR).

To test server crashing down (aborting) in the middle of the RPC:
$./server -o file1.ior -k KEY1
$./Manager -a file://file1.ior -k KEY1 -c g.ior

To test server gracefully shutting down in the middle of the RPC:
$./server -o file1.ior -k KEY1
$./Manager -a file://file1.ior -k KEY1 -c g.ior -s

You can also test behavior of client when using IOGR with two servers
by supplying -g as the option to Manager.

To test servers crashing down (aborting) in the middle of the RPC:
$./server -o file1.ior -k KEY1
$./server -o file2.ior -k KEY2
$./Manager -a file://file1.ior -k KEY1 -b file://file2.ior -l KEY2 -c g.ior -g

To test one of two serversshutting down in the middle of the RPC:
$./server -o file1.ior -k KEY1
$./server -o file2.ior -k KEY2
$./Manager -a file://file1.ior -k KEY1 -b file://file2.ior -l KEY2 -c g.ior -g -s

The complete test can be run by run_test.pl.
The script exits with error code != 0 in case of error.
