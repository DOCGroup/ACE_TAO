OMG Naming Service

File: DevGuideExamples/NamingService/Naming_Server/README

The example in NamingService/Naming_Client is modified to utilize
the TAO_Naming_Server class.  This class enables the Naming Service
to easily be collocated within an application.  In this example,
the Naming Service is collocated with a server that supports the
Messenger Interface described in GettingStartedUNIX (or GettingStartedVC).

The Server code is stored in:

DevGuideExamples/NamingService/Naming_Server/MessengerServer.cpp


How to Run
----------

To start the server:
------------------
./MessengerServer -o ns.ior

To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient  -ORBInitRef NameService=file://ns.ior


Exeuction via Perl Script
-------------------------

A Perl script has been created to automate the three steps shown
above.  This script can be run via the following command:

./run_test.pl


NOTE: This example has been changed from the example that appears in the
dev-guide in order to pass command line parameters to the thread
that runs the naming server.
