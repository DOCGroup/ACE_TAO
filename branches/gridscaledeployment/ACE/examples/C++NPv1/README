The files in this directory contain the source code from the book
``C++ Network Programming: Mastering Complexity Using ACE and
Patterns'' (C++NPv1) by Douglas C. Schmidt and Stephen D. Huston
(Addison-Wesley 2001, ISBN 0-201-60464-7).

We have compiled and run these files on the following platforms:

        Sun Solaris 8 on SPARC using Sun Forte 6.
        Redhat Linux 7.1 using g++ 2.96.
        Microsoft Windows 2000 using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.

You must have the ACE_ROOT environment variable set correctly to build
these examples. ACE_ROOT must refer to the top-level ACE_wrappers
directory.  Please see $ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html for instructions on
how to build the ACE toolkit.

Mapping Source Files to Book Chapters
-------------------------------------

The files in this directory map to the chapters in C++NPv1 as follows:

Chapter 4       Logging_Client.h
                Logging_Client.cpp
                Logging_Handler.h
                Logging_Handler.cpp
                Iterative_Logging_Server.h
                Iterative_Logging_Server.cpp

Chapter 7       Reactive_Logging_Server.h
                Reactive_Logging_Server.cpp
                Reactive_Logging_Server_Ex.h
                Reactive_Logging_Server_Ex.cpp

Chapter 8       Process_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.h
                Process_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp

Chapter 9       Thread_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.h
                Thread_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp
                RT_Thread_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.h
                RT_Thread_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp

Microsoft Visual C++ users:
---------------------------

The examples.dsw file is a Microsoft Visual C++ workspace file that
contains projects for the individual programs. You can either build
them separately, or use the Batch Build command to build multiple
projects at once.

All other users:
----------------

Assuming that your system is configured correctly, you should be able
to type

% make

to compile all of the programs, and

% make clean

to remove all the files that were generated during compilation.

There are also individual Makefiles for each separate example program.
These makefiles have a ".mak" suffix. For example, Logging_Client.mak
is the makefile for the Logging_Client program.

All of the files in these directories are copyright Addison Wesley,
and they come with absolutely no warranty whatsoever.  Permission is
