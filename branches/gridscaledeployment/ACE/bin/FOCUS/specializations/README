============

This file describes certain common conventions regarding how the
specializations rules are integrated/added to this specialization
database. This directory will serve as a repository that will host all
the specialization rules for the different families/components. At the
moment, all the specialization transformations are specific to the
ACE+TAO middleware.

For each component framework, the following are the rules for adding
the specializations:

. Create a directory with the name of the component family, e.g., Reactor_Family
. Within this directory, create the <<Specific_Component>>.spl file that has the
  individual transformations defined.
