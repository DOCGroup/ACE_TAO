This test tests the reader.

The following methods of the reader are tested:

* read_one
* read_all
* read_one_last
* read_one_all

First of all, the Sender writes a known number of samples to DDS.
After that the Sender informs the Receiver which test is about
to run and how many samples should be read from DDS. Before the
Receiver starts reading, he must find out that all samples resides
in DDS on the receiving side. He does that by calling read_last every
time a DATA_ON_READERS_STATUS comes in on the ConnectorStatusListener.
Once the very last sample is in DDS on the receiving side, the Receiver
starts to read the samples. Afterwards he checks wether all samples are
avaiable (thus are read correctly from DDS).

The Receiver also test whether the correct exceptions are thrown.
