Cornucopia Code Generation Test
===============================

This test is for correct code generation, the various
artifacts compile and link, but there is no executable.

The IDL file in this directory was put together to have
a wide variety of IDL3 and non-template IDL3+
constructs, and some features
not yet present in other CIAO tests and examples:

            Non-template IDL3+

- porttype
- port
- mirrorport

            IDL3

- inheritance of operations and attributes in:
  - facet interfaces
  - supported interfaces
  - homes
  - components (attributes only)

- inheritance of factory and finder operations

- raises, getraises and setraises constructs

- separate scoping for supported interfaces,
  port interfaces, derived components, and homes

- skeleton and servant generated files in separate
  builds/libraries
