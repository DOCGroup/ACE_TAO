Reused Facet Interface Test
===========================

This test uses IDL that contains a variety of port, attribute,
operation, factory and finder definitions, some inherited. The
main focus of the test, however, is the reuse of the same
interface for two different facet ports. The facet servant class,
and facet executor IDL interface must be generated only once.
