	* ace/Reactor.h (ACE_Reactor):
	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Added a new method resumable_handler () to the
	  reactor interface. This would indicate whether the application
	  can take advantage by resuming the handlers themselves or
	  not. Not all reactors can allow this feature.

	* ace/Reactor_Impl.h:
	* ace/Reactor_Impl.cpp: Added a pure virtual function so that all
	  the implementations can decide whether the handlers are
	  resumable or not.

	* ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
	* ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
	* ace/TP_Reactor.h:
	* ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
	* ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:
	* ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:Implemented resumable_handlers ().

	* ace/CDR_Stream.cpp: Changed the copy constructor for the
	  ACE_InputCDR's. Instead of duplicating the ACE_Data_Block we
	  now use the new copy constructor in the ACE_Message_Block.

	* ace/Message_Block.h:
	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Added a new copy constructor to the
	  ACE_Message_Block. This copy constructor does a deep copy from
	  the data block if the data block of the incoming message block
	  is on the stack or does a shallow copy of the data block (by
	  incrementing the ref count) if it is on the heap.
