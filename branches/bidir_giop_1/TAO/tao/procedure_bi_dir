1. Transport does these
   - prepares headers
   - sends header using the handle from the connection handler

2. Connection handler handle_input does these
   - first reads GIOP header, determines whether it is a request or a
   reply. If request, then increment refcount, read request, calls
   process_request () messages  on the GIOP. If reply call, process
   reply on GIOP

3. Need to do processing of requests and replies!!
4. Mux_Strategy is the problem!! -- talk with Irfan


NOTE: Just start making simple transports, then add GIOP stuff as you
need them
