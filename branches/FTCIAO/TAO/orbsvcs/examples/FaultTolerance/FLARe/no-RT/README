FLARe concepts
==============


State Synchronization
---------------------

Each FLARe server process contains one StateSynchronizationAgent (SSA) object 
that is responsible for distributing the states of the applications running in 
this process. The applicatios have the obligation of implementing the 
ReplicatedApplication interface. The SSA kann either use direct CORBA 
communication or DDS to disseminate the state to other replicas for the
primary applications.

The following steps are executed to disseminate the state of an application
using DDS:

- a ReplicationManager is started up
- for each node, a host_manager is started up
- each server process is started up
  - SSA is activated
  - application servants are activated
  - applications are registered with the agent through register_application ()
  - SSA created DDS topic for name of the application and creates a datawriter
    and datareader for this topic.
