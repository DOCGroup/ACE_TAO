This directory contains the implementations for worker components.
They have the same component definition and share the same
stub/skeleton/servant lib implementations.  That is, they appear to be
the same to their client but they behave differently.

Workers provide the Common_Ops interface which allows their client to
request them to "do some work."  Two differnt kinds of worker
components are available here:

1. Compute_Bound worker (CB_Worker)

   Upon receiving a request to perform some work, it will perform some
   heavy computation and eat up a lot of CPU cycles before returning.

2. IO_Bound worker (IOB_Worker)

   Upon receiving a request to perform some work, it will perform some
   I/O operations before returning.
