ESSENTIAL CHANGES:

  2. changed #include "Time.h"  to  #include "TimeC.h".

  3. Moved standard #includes below local #includes, and 
     commented-out unnecessary #includes:
       -client.cpp now reads:

            #include <iomanip.h>
            //#include <iostream.h>
       -server.cpp now reads:
            #include "server.h"
            //#include <time.h>
            //#include <iostream.h>

ADDITIONAL CHANGES:
  4. added .in() to _var type parameters 
       -3 times in client.cpp for calls to is_nil() and _narrow()
       -3 times in main() in server.cpp 
         for calls to _narrow(), object_to_string, and <<
