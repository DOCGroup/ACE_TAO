 *
 * This implementation is necessary for cases where the
 * <ACE_Select_Reactor> is run in a multi-threaded program.  In
 * this case, we need to be able to unblock <select> or <poll>
 * when updates occur other than in the main
 * <ACE_Select_Reactor> thread.  To do this, we signal an
 * auto-reset event the <ACE_Select_Reactor> is listening on.
 * If an <ACE_Event_Handler> and <ACE_Select_Reactor_Mask> is
 * passed to <notify>, the appropriate <handle_*> method is
 * dispatched in the context of the <ACE_Select_Reactor> thread.
