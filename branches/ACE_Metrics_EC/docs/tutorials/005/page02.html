<P>We begin with <I><A HREF="server.cpp">server.cpp</A></I>.
<P>
Abstraction by Kirthika:
<UL>
This tutorial is a re-cap of the client-server hookup tutorial with much
 cleaner code (for instance: use of destroy() to delete objects and
process() which does the task of reading in data from the client).
<P>
We again enroll the services of the ACE_Reactor to handle events. Everything
occurs in a single thread.
<P>
This tutorial is a stepping stone towards a mutithreaded server model.
