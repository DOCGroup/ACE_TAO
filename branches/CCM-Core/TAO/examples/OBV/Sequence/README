This example demonstrate how to use valuetypes with some
structured data type like sequence.

To run the test, run:

  server -f ior
  client -f ior

At this moment, TAO_IDL compiler does not support putting valuetype in
a sequence.  Make sure you copy seriesC.*.bak to seriesC.* after
running the IDL compiler.
