	A simple test for the DSI/DII gateway support. TAO can
optimize some demarshaling/marshaling and data copying in the
implementation of DSI/DII based gateways.
	This is a smoke test and simple example for those features.

	Use:

$ server -o server.ior
$ gateway -k file://server.ior -o gw.ior
$ client -k file://gw.ior -i 100 -x

	or run the run_test.pl script.
