This directory contains a number of tests that illustrate the
performance of TAO and other ORBs.  The individual directories contain
READMEs on how to run the following performance tests:

        . AMI

          A latency test for AMI requests

        . AMH_Single_Threaded

	  Latency tests for AMH-enabled applications

        . DII

          A latency test for DII requests

        . DSI

          A latency test for DSI servers

        . Deferred

          A latency test for deferred synchronous requests

	. Single_Threaded

	  Latency test for single threaded applications

	. Thread_Pool

	  Latency test for thread pool servers (and threaded clients)

	. Thread_Per_Connection

	  Latency test for thread-per-connection servers (and threaded
	  clients)
