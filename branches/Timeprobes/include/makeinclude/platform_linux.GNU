#### GNU gas has a string limit of 4096 characters.  On Alphas,
#### builds will fail due to running over that limit.  There are
#### at least two workarounds:
#### 1) Change the limit to 8192 characters and rebuild gas.  See
####    ACE-INSTALL.html for more information.
#### 2) Don't use -g when compiling those files.
#### If you're building on an Alpha and you haven't hacked and
#### rebuilt gas, you might need to uncomment the following.
#### ifeq ($(debug),1)
####   SUPPRESS_DASH_G = 1
#### endif # debug
