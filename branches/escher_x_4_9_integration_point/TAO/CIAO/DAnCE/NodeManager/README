/**

@page NodeManager README File

      CIAO's NodeManager implementation. NodeManager is the bootstraping
mechanism to create new NodeApplication on the localhost.  We
currently depend on starting the NodeApplicationManager process on
some port of all the hosts that have NodeApplication install to
function properly. The port to run this daemon can be set by using the
TAO ORB options command of -ORBEndpoint <port>. This replaces the
earlier CIAO_Daemon  implementation of CIAO as defined in the CCM
specification.
