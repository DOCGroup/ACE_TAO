## This is an example script to launch the server.

# the mywebaddress variable should point to a URL which is world-readable
# the mywebdir variable should point to the actual pathname of the URL
# which is specified by the mywebaddress variable
# The server needs to have write access to the mywebdir directory.
# Thus, the server saves images into the "mywebdir", and clients
# can access them via the "mywebaddress" URL.

# the 222222 number is the port number on which the server is to be launched
# the same port number should appear in the html document containing
# the client applet (see start.html for an example)

# while running the server, the ./classes should be part of the CLASSPATH.
# while running the client, the client classes as well as the awtCommand
# toolkit should be world-readable. (The awtcommand toolkit is included
# in this toolkit, under the classes directory.)
