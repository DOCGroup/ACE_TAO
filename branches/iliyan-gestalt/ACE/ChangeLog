        * ASNMP/asnmp/snmperrs.h:

          Added an unknown error code message to the pErrs array to avoid
          getting a garbage pointer from Snmp::error_string() in the event
          that the error code is outside the valid range.

Wed Mar 26 15:32:01 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

Tue Mar 25 14:19:31 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          When generating the linker command line for executable linked against
          static libs, exclude the "libFoo.a" form of the libraries.  They are
          already accounted for by "-lFoo" arguments.  This resolved Bugzilla
          Bug #3266.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (event_timedwait): Fixed this code so that
          it will treat 0 using "wait indefinitely" semantics for Windows
          and all other OS platforms.  Thanks to Paul Carter <pcarter at

          at scires dot com> for contributing this.

Mon Mar 24 15:43:28 UTC 2008  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/MPC.cfg:

          MPC can now be configured to recognize ACE_TMAIN as an executable
          entry point. We no longer need to explicitly state that a project will
          be an executable in the MPC file, MPC will automatically deduce that
          the project is an executable given the presence of ACE_TMAIN.

          This change above relates to the following change in MPC:

          from the target to the local machine. By default, it does nothing.
          It's meant for use by targets that don't necessarily have locally
          accessible file systems, such as LabVIEW RT.

        * bin/Run_Test.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm: Add support for running tests on
          LabVIEW RT similarly to the way they're done on VxWorks; TAO tests
          run the server on the target and the client on the host.

        * bin/LabVIEW_RT/labview_test_controller/labview_test_controller.cpp:
          Catch exceptions and try to report it to stderr before the machine

          Use the proper form of ACE_TMAIN. Namely, the argv parameter
          should be "ACE_TCHAR *argv[]" instead of "ACE_TCHAR **argv"
          or "ACE_TCHAR *[]" instead of "ACE_TCHAR **"

          with ACE/TAO/CIAO coding standards.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Rearranged some rules so that C files are compiled with the
          C compiler on OpenVMS

Mon Mar  3 06:57:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ProcessVX.pm:

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Added -r as option to specify an alternate root test directory
          instead of the current directory. Combined this with -l we can
          then run perl scripts for testing project code.

Thu Feb 28 16:08:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/generate_compile_stats.sh:
          Added --compiler as option so that we can specify a different
          compiler then gcc

Thu Feb 28 08:32:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/ACE-bug-process.html:
          Removed cvs

Wed Feb 27 19:28:18 UTC 2008  William Otte  <wotte@william-ottes-macbook-pro.local>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

Tue Feb 26 15:52:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Added support for buildbits=64

Tue Feb 26 09:18:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Added some compiler flags to reduce the number of warnings/errors
          in the OpenVMS builds

Mon Feb 25 19:44:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:
          Added IgnoreHostRoot which can be set from a test script. That way
          when doing cross host testing we can make sure we don't get the
          executable from the host root directory. This is for example usefull
          when we want to spawn perl or another system utility

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Removed commented out line

Mon Feb 25 14:30:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.2.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.3.GNU:
          Added LD_PARTIALFLAGS which can be set for footprint builds

Mon Feb 25 08:13:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Set ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN when
          ACE_THR_FUNC_RETURN is an integral type

        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN to determine whether
          we can do a reinterpret_cast or static_cast. This is much easier
          then checking all compilers

Sun Feb 24 19:37:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Removed commented out code

Sat Feb 23 06:56:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Moved ACE_Message_Queue_NT to its own file

Fri Feb 22 08:54:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/global.features:
          Default optimize_collocated_invocations to 1

Fri Feb 22 00:34:17 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added !LabVIEW_RT to all tests that haven't
          been adapted to the non-local filesystem mechanism I invented to run
          tests for LabVIEW RT targets (and can also be used for other target
          types). Now I can enable TAO tests for the LabVIEW RT scoreboard
          build.

Thu Feb 21 15:25:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/Download.html:

          Updated for x.6.3

Thu Feb 21 02:34:37 CST 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
