Wed Mar 19 13:45:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtech.com>

        * ace/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Remove TAO/tests/Bug_1482_Regression from LynxOS.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
          Layout change

Tue Mar 18 20:17:55 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessLVRT.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/TestTarget_LVRT.pm: Handle timeouts to the target better
          and smarten up the way it gets log files from a failed target.

        * bin/PerlACE/TestTarget.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/TestTarget_LVRT.pm: Add a GetFile() method to get a file
          from the target to the local machine. By default, it does nothing.
          It's meant for use by targets that don't necessarily have locally
          accessible file systems, such as LabVIEW RT.

        * bin/Run_Test.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm: Add support for running tests on
          LabVIEW RT similarly to the way they're done on VxWorks; TAO tests
          run the server on the target and the client on the host.

        * bin/LabVIEW_RT/labview_test_controller/labview_test_controller.cpp:
          Catch exceptions and try to report it to stderr before the machine
          locks up, dies, etc.

Tue Mar 18 07:33:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Fixe warning with GCC 4.2 on AIX

Fri Mar 14 19:07:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU:
          Disable visibility by default. With GCC 4.2 on AIX we get warnings
          that visibility is not supported in that configuration

Fri Mar 14 15:02:33 UTC 2008  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

Fri Mar 14 09:30:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU:
          Don't use -mcpu=common, that is an ancient default of AIX 5.1

Thu Mar 13 12:41:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU:

          <thomas dot g dot girard at free dot fr> for reporting this.
          This fixes bugzilla 3147

Wed Mar 12 11:59:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/FoxReactor/FoxReactor.{h,cpp}:
          Removed check for ACE_HAS_FOX

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Changed fox handling, matches the other reactors. Thanks to

Tue Mar 11 12:24:43 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h: Add #include "ace/config.h" so a setting for
          ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE can be seen. Fixes compile warnings.

Tue Mar 11 12:20:02 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed compile error. No need to use
          ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR for a char* literal.

Mon Mar 10 22:27:09 UTC 2008  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@wakefield.txcorp.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h: Removed redundant inclusion of Obstack.h.  It is
          included later in Svc_Conf_Param.h.  Removing this extra
          inclusion allows us to build on MacOS Leopard with optimization
          enabled.

Mon Mar 10 15:35:02 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h cpp} (log): For %C, clearly note that it always prints
          a narrow-char string, and adjust the va_arg to match. Thanks to
          Russell Morra for reporting this issue.

Mon Mar 10 13:20:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Multicast_Test.cpp:
          When sending fails, print the ip address we are using in the error
          message.

Sat Mar  8 16:23:57 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (send): Enhanced the code to allow sends
          of 0-sized datagrams.  Thanks to Andi Heusser <aheusser at gmail
          dot com> for this fix.

Thu Mar  6 16:49:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
          Rearranged some rules to make sure c/C files are compiled with the

Thu Mar  6 13:10:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Thu Mar  6 10:33:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Removed restriction that only a shared or static build can be done

Wed Mar  5 07:54:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Don't run the parallel connect strategy test on VxWorks 5.5, the
          command length of the shell is not long enough.

Tue Mar  4 09:27:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ProcessVX.pm:
          Added a retry to the iPass protocol code, in a full test run
          we sometimes see that the reboot has failed. With this retry
          we hopefully get rid of those false test failures

Tue Mar  4 05:54:22 UTC 2008  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/svn_props.py:

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Added -r as option to specify an alternate root test directory

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:

        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN to determine whether
          we can do a reinterpret_cast or static_cast. This is much easier
          then checking all compilers

Fri Feb 22 00:34:17 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added !LabVIEW_RT to all tests that haven't
          been adapted to the non-local filesystem mechanism I invented to run
          tests for LabVIEW RT targets (and can also be used for other target
          types). Now I can enable TAO tests for the LabVIEW RT scoreboard
          build.
