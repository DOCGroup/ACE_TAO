A place holder for CIAO's CIDL compiler. 

Please see some infromation about rationale behind naming convention at
the end of this file.

* Executor mapping can be found at:  Chapter 3.3 of formal/02-06-65

  <filename>E.*

* Templates for generic servants (container glue code) will be
  available from $CIAO_ROOT/docs/templates/

  These classes should be put into CIAO_GLUE namespace.

  <filename>G.*

* Component descriptors: Chapter 6.4 of formal/02-06-65

  <flatname>.ccd

  How to import this information into GME 2000?

* I think it may be a good thing to do to be able to represent IDL
  definition in XML format and be able to exchange (import/export) IDL
  definitions via XML documents.  What is the spec. for this?

* Likewise, it would be cool to have component-aware IfR so we can
  either import component definitions into GME tools through the XML
  files, or allow GME tools to query component capabilities via IfR.

* Need to fix the collocated valuetype passed by reference bug.

Naming Convention.

The CIAO's CIDL compiler directory was called CIDLC which stands for
CIDL Compiler (like CC stands for C Compiler, etc). This directory
wasn't called CCIDLC (CIAO's CIDL Compiler) or CIAO_CIDLC because 
that would incure needless tautology since the directory structure 
(.../CIAO/tools/CIDLC) already implies that it's CIAO's CIDC.

Now about CIDLC executable name. The logical name of the excutable 
implied by directory name (CIDLC) would be cidlc (like cc for 
C Compiler). However there was a concern originally expressed by
Nanbor that cidlc is too generic name and when installed for 
example as /usr/bin/cidlc would loose it's CIAO's context.

At the same time recommended by FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) 
package installation location is /opt/<package>. Thus if installation 
directory would be for instance /opt/CIAO then naming CIDLC executable 
ciao_cidlc would create needless tautology (i.e./opt/CIAO/bin/ciao_cidlc).
Though in my opinion there is nothing bad in having generic name like 
cidlc (user always can execute cidlc --version) and as suggested by FHS 
installations like /usr/bin/ciao_cidl are non-conformant the decision was
made to call CIAO's CIDLC execuatable ciao_cidlc.
