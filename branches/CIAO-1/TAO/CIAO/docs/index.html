<h1>CIAO - Component-Integrated ACE ORB</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
CIAO is TAO's implementation of <a
href="http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/01-11-03"> CORBA Component
Model (CCM)</a> specially optimized for distributed real-time embedded
(DRE) systems.  This page contains links to other documents and
resources for using <i>CIAO</i>.

<h2>Documents</h2>
Here is a set of UML diagrams that we use to figure out the
relationship among all the different classes in CCM.  You can browse
the related part from the following list:
<UL>
  <li><a href="imgs/component-basic.png"> Basic component interfaces
      </a></li>
  <li><a href="imgs/home-config.png"> Home and configuration interfaces
      </a></li>
  <li><a href="imgs/basic-container.png"> Basic container interfaces
      </a></li>
  <li><a href="imgs/extended-container.png"> Extended container
      interfaces </a></li>
  <li><a href="img/deployment.png"> Deployment and installation
      interfaces </a></li>
</UL>
All these diagrams are generating from the <a href="imgs/CCM.vsd">CCM.vsd
Visio file</a> (The same file in Visio V.5 format is <a href="imgs/CCM-v5.vsd">here</a>.)


<h2>Project Status</h2>
<table border="1" width="90%">
  <th> Modules </th>
  <th> Status </th>

  <tr>
    <td>TAO_IDL</td>
    <td>
        TAO_IDL front-end has been extended to handle the keyword
        extension added by compnent model specification.  (It is still
        in Jeff's branch, however.)  The next stage will be to start
        implementing the code for backend code generation.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>CIAO_CIDL</td>
    <td>
        CIAO_CIDL is still an unknown at this point.  We do know that
        we have no plan to support persistentstate service in the near
        future.  For starter, we will probably only support a simple
        construct like the followingsee :
<pre>
        import &lt;some_component.idl&gt;;

        module component_composit_nasee me {
          composition session component_home_executor {
            implements component_home;
            manages component_executor;
          };
        };
</pre>
        We will need to generate the implementation for the following
        interfaces/operations (also see this <a
        href="imgs/executor-example.png"> example </a>):
        <ul>
          <li><code>Navigation</code>
          <li><code>Receptacle</code>
          <li><code>Event</code>
          <li>Internal/callback interface?
          <li>Executor stuff?
        </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>CCM Core</td>
    <td>We are currently working on the prototype that can install a
        component remotely using the CCM
        <code>ComponentInstallation</code> interface.  Since TAO_IDL
        still doesn't generate component specific code yet, and we
        still don't have a CIDL implementation, we will also write up
        an example to show how the code should be generated in both
        TAO_IDL and CIAO_CIDL compiler.</td>
  </tr>
