This example is the Qt-based GUI implementation of NavDisplay component.

It is NOT necessary to compile ACE/TAO/CIAO with Qt support,
i.e. ACE_HAS_QT since this example does not relyes on Qt Reactor and
communicates with GUI part using QApplication::postMessage() and
simple Command Pattern based framework.  But be sure that QTDIR
environment variable is pointed to your Qt instalation directory.

This example uses the test client application from ../NavDisplay
directory.  You can use run_test.pl located in this directory (not in
../NavDisplay) to run the example.

The expected behaviour - you should be able to see the moving red dot
over the map and changing values of x and y coordinates in
corresponding edit boxes. After several seconds the red dot stops and
then after five seconds the application will be automatically closed.
