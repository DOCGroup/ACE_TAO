The root directory of this example (the directory this note resides)
contains only facets and eventtype that are shared by all components
under various subdirectories.  Therefore, there's no actualy executor
implementations for these interfaces instead, the example stop at the
servant glue code library which can be used by the actualy component
implementation.

I'm not sure, at this point, how we can handle this (where neither
actualy component definition nor cidl definition are available)
situation with CIDL compiler.  It looks like we should be able to pass
a bunch of IDL definitions thru CIDL compiler and get the equivalent
executor interfaces automatically.  But we'll have to see.
