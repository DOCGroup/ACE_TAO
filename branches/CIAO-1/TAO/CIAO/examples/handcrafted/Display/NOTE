The root directory of this example (the directory this note resides)
contains only facets and eventtype that are shared by all components
under various subdirectories.  Therefore, there's no actualy executor
implementations for these interfaces instead, the example stop at the
servant glue code library which can be used by the actualy component
implementation.

I'm not sure, at this point, how we can handle this (where neither
actualy component definition nor cidl definition are available)
situation with CIDL compiler.  It looks like we should be able to pass
a bunch of IDL definitions thru CIDL compiler and get the equivalent
executor interfaces automatically.  But we'll have to see.

To try out this example, read the following document taken from a
short note I wrote for a snapshot release:

     This is a multiple-component example.  RateGen component
     subdirectory contains a run_test.pl that you can use to
     instantiate a component instance, like you would do with the
     Hello example.  The other components require collaboration with
     other components and I don't have client programs to test them
     out individually.

     This example also lets you compose all the components into a
     distributed application using the Assembly_Deployer.  Change
     directory to

        $CIAO_ROOT/examples/handcrafted/Display/descriptors

     and take a look at the file: NOTE.txt.  This file describes the
     steps to compose the application using various different
     configurations and composition specs.

* There are MSVC 6 workspaces and projects available in the workspace.
  Some of them also contain UNIX makefiles.  If you can not find the
  Makefiles for unix platform you are using, you can use mwc to create
  them.  For examples, to compile the multi-component example, use the
  following:

        $ cd $CIAO_ROOT/examples/handcrafted/Display
        $ $(ACE_ROOT)/bin/mwc.pl
        $ make

  To regenerate VC6 dsp files, do:

        > cd $CIAO_ROOT/examples/handcrafted/Display
        > $(ACE_ROOT)/bin/mwc.pl -type vc6

  Likewise, to regenerate VC7.NET project files, do:

        > cd $CIAO_ROOT/examples/handcrafted/Display
        > $(ACE_ROOT)/bin/mwc.pl -type vc7
