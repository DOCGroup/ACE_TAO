This example showcases a component implementation in its simplest
form.  The utmost purpose is to demonstrate how easy it is to
implement a component and a system using CCM.

Currently, we define the equivelent interfaces for both the client
side and server side (servants and executors) manually because both
the IDL3 and CCIDL compilers are under development.
