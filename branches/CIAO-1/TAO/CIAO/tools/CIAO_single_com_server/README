Summary
-------

This directory contains an implmentation for a "simple" component
server.  Although it is called "CIAO_single_com_server", it can host
multiple component implementations.

Running
-------

To run the component server, invoke it from command line as foloowing:

  CIAO_single_com_server -i <config_file> -o <ior_output_file>

The <config_file> currently contains information the component server
needs to install component implementations.  The detail format of the
file will be explained at the end of this file.  This configuration
mechanism should eventually be replaced by the standard component
deployment interfaces so component are installed and instantiated
through a set of interfaces.

The <ior_output_file> points to the file name where the component
server will output a list of IORs (for home interfaces) hosted on the
component server.  It will no longer be needed when we have the
trivial HomeFinder interfaces implemented.

Server Configuration:
---------------------
There is currently not much to configure for the component server.


Config file format:
-------------------

We are temporarily using a config file to read in the list of
components that are to be installed into the component server.  Each
line of the configuration file contains a set of information for
installing one component home (the component home manages the life
cycle for managed comopnent instances.)  These info. are delimited by
the vertical bar '|' characters.  Here is an example for the
"HelloHome" component home in
$(CIAO_ROOT)/examples/handcrafted/Hello/.

hello_executors|createHelloHome_Impl|hello_servants|createHelloHome_Servant|IDL:omg.org/HelloHome:1.0|IDL:omg.org/HelloWorld:1.0|HelloHome

Here's a breakdown of what each field contains:

0 -> Name of the DLL containing component and component home executors
1 -> Entry point (factory method) for the previous DLL
2 -> Name of the DLL containing component and component home servant
     glue code.
3 -> Entry point (factory method) for the previous DLL
4 -> Repo ID for the component home interface
5 -> Repo ID for the managed component interface
6 -> Canonical name for the installed component home.

Todos
-----

Improve the command line processing routine.  Currently, we do not
process the ORB command line options correctly.
