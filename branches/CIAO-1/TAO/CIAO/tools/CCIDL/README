A place holder for CIAO's CIDL (CCIDL) compiler.

* Executor mapping can be found at:  Chapter 3.3 of formal/02-06-65

  <filename>E.*

* Templates for generic servants (container glue code) will be
  available from $CIAO_ROOT/docs/templates/

  These classes should be put into CIAO_GLUE namespace.

  <filename>G.*

* Component descriptors: Chapter 6.4 of formal/02-06-65

  <flatname>.ccd

  How to import this information into GME 2000?

* I think it may be a good thing to do to be able to represent IDL
  definition in XML format and be able to exchange (import/export) IDL
  definitions via XML documents.  What is the spec. for this?

* Need to fix the collocated valuetype passed by reference bug.
