This directory contains an implementation of ServerActivator, which is
the per-host daemon process CIAO's deployment and assembling framework
uses to spawn new component servers on the host.  CIAO currently does
not define how the deployment and assembling framework can locate
ServerActivator's so it is recommended that you start up all your
ServerActivator processes at a specific host.

The ServerActivator implementation registers a simple ObjectKey
"ServerActivator" to the IORTable, so if you start up the
ServerActivator process with:

  ServerActivator -ORBEndpoint iiop://hostname:13000

You can get to the ServerActivator interface using the following
IOR:

  corbaloc:iiop:hostname:13000/ServerActivator


Other command line flags supported by ServerActivator include:

  * -n <pathname> : Specify the pathname ServerActivator uses to
                    startup a ComponentServer process.

  * -o <filename> : Specify the filename ServerActivator uses to
                    write the IOR.

  * -i <ior> : Specify the IOR for the ComponentInstallation interface.
               It will be passed as

                  "-ORBInitRef ComponentInstallation=<ior>"

               command line options to the ComponentServer.

  * -d <second> : Specify the time, in second, ServerActivator will
                  wait for the ComponentServer to callback to notify
                  ServerActivator their IOR.  ServerActivator
                  considers the activation fails if the
                  ComponentServer does not call back in time.

  * -c : Try creating a container and install a home.

There is also a simple test program in this directory called
ServerActivator_test_client.  It is used to debug ServerActivator
implementation.
