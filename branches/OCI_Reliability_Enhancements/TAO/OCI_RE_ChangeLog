        * tao/VarOut_T.inl:

          Move explicit point dereference operation from variable length
          vars to base so it can be applied to vars for fixed length types
          as well. This is intended to improve portability away from ORBs
          that provided this operation. Caution should be exercised when
          using the returned pointer as the var still owns the reference and
          will clean it up when it goes out of scope.

        * tests/Var_Deref:

          Added a test for the above. The test will not compile unless
          the explicit cast operation is available for fixed types.
