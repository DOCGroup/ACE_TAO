This program tests the following fault tolerant naming service implementation
use cases:

1) Validate that a client can seamlessly connect to the alternate server of a
	 server naming server pair after the other server has been terminated.

2) Validate that a client can seamlessly invoke naming operations on either
	 server instanance.

3) Validate that repository data written by the name service is available upon
   startup.

Run the application as follows:

$$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/tao_ft_naming -o <file1.ior> -ORBListenEndPoints iiop://<hostname>:<port1> -r <directory>
$$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/tao_ft_naming -o <file2.ior> -ORBListenEndPoints iiop://<hostname>:<port2> -r <directory>

Example client with failover list
$$ACE_ROOT/bin/tao_nsgroup -ORBDefaultInitRef corbaloc:iiop:<hostname>:<port1>,iiop:<hostname>:<port2> group_list

Example client for first instance only
$$ACE_ROOT/bin/tao_nsgroup -ORBDefaultInitRef corbaloc:iiop:<hostname>:<port1> group_list

Example client for second instance only
$$ACE_ROOT/bin/tao_nsgroup -ORBDefaultInitRef corbaloc:iiop:<hostname>:<port2> group_list


Failover Test
1. Run two instances of tao_ft_naming service on the same host but different ports.
2. Verify that tao_nslist and tao_nsgroup with a corbaloc reference list can access the tao_ft_naming service
3. Kill the primary tao_ft_naming server
4. Verify that tao_nslist and tao_nsgroup with a corbaloc reference list can still access the tao_ft_naming service
5. Restart the first tao_ft_naming server instance and verify it is now the redundant service

Persistance Test
1. Run one instance of tao_ft_naming service
2. Create a new context with tao_nsadd
3. Create a new object group and add a member with tao_nsgroup and bind the object group to a name
4. Verify the new name, object group and member are in the tao_ft_naming repository.
5. Kill the tao_ft_naming server
6. Start a new instance of the tao_ft_naming server
7. Verify the new name, object group and member are in the tao_ft_naming repository.

Redundant Equivalancy Test
1. Run two instances of tao_ft_naming service on the same host but different ports.
2. Verify that tao_nslist and tao_nsgroup with a corbaloc primary reference can access the primary tao_ft_naming service
3. Create a new context with tao_nsadd on the primary tao_ft_naming service
4. Create a new object group and add a member with tao_nsgroup and bind the object group to a name on the secondary tao_ft_naming service
5. Verify the new name, object group and member are in the tao_ft_naming repository
