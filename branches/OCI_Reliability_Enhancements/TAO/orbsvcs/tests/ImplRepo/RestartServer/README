This test verifies that if a server launched by the ImR activator is terminated,
then it will be relaunched transparently by the ORB if the client makes another
request if -ORBForwardOnTransientLimit and -ORBForwardOnReplyClosedLimit options
are used.

Note that TAO does not have a way of knowing if server actually processed the
request, so that the CORBA "at most once" guarantee may be violated if
-ORBForwardOnReplyClosedLimit is used.
