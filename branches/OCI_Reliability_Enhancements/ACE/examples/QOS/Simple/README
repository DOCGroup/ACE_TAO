A Regression test for ACE QoS features.
---------------------------------------

This test implements a simple Receiver-Sender program that ensures
Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees on the underlying network before
transmitting data. The program tests the ACE QoS APIs/features. The
test works for Winsock2 APIs on Win2K as well as RAPI on Solaris.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
WIN2K :

Build Requirements :
--------------------
1. Two Win2K machines.
2. June98 Platform SDK or later.
3. Link with ws2_32.lib

The test consists of a receiver and a sender.

 The sender is started first (though it is not mandatory) as :

 sender -m merengue.cs.wustl.edu:9091 -P 10004

 -m: specifies the multicast session address that both client and
     server subscribe to for QoS events.

 -p: Protocol to be used. Could be udp or tcp. Default is udp.

 -P: Sender source port. If not specified, DEFAULT_SOURCE_SENDER_PORT
     (10001) will be used.

 -h: Displays the help on various options.

The sample Sender is started next as :

  receiver -m merengue.cs.wustl.edu:9091

 -m: specifies the multicast session address that both client and
     server subscribe to for QoS events.

 -n: Option to be used by senders only to specify the destination
     address. This option is overriden if a multicast address is also
     specified through the -m option.

 -p: Protocol to be used. Could be udp or tcp. Default is udp.

 -P: Sender source port. If not specified, DEFAULT_SOURCE_SENDER_PORT
     (10001) will be used.

 -h: Displays the help on various options.

On Win2K the user must have administrative access to the machine to
run this program.  It seems to be a pre-requisite to opening QoS
sockets.

The sender and receiver should be run on different Win2K machines.

The test demonstrates how to GQOS enable an application using the ACE QoS APIs.
It concentrates on the use of various ACE QoS APIs and their correctness.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAPI :

0. The $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU should include the
following :

include /project/doc/vishal/ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/<appropriate platform macros file eg.platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU>
PLATFORM_RAPI_CPPFLAGS += -I/project/doc/vishal/rapi/rel4.2a4/rsvpd/
PLATFORM_RAPI_LIBS += -lrsvp
PLATFORM_RAPI_LDFLAGS += -L/project/doc/vishal/rapi/rel4.2a4/rsvpd/

assuming that RAPI library is installed in /project/doc/vishal/rapi/rel4.2a4/

1. Compile ACE with

   make rapi=1

2. Run the RSVP Daemon on two machines: (merengue.cs and macarena.cs)

   /project/doc/vishal/rapi/rel4.2a4/rsvpd/rsvpd -D

   The current version of the daemon comes with an inbuilt rtap
   application to test the various reservation commands and RAPI APIs.

   Typical values for rtap would be :

   dest udp macarena/5000
   sender merengue/5000 [ t 2000000 100000 2000000 512 1024 ]

   dest udp macarena/5000
   reserve wf [ cl 2000000 100000 2000000 512 1024 ]

3. If RTAP runs fine and the daemons show the debug messages about
   RESV, PATH and other RSVP messages, run the QoS example, making sure
   that rtap session is released on both machines.

The test consists of a receiver and a sender.

 The sender is started first (though it is not mandatory) as :

 sender -m macarena.cs.wustl.edu:9091 -P 10004

 -m: specifies the multicast session address that both client and
     server subscribe to for QoS events.

 -p: Protocol to be used. Could be udp or tcp. Default is udp.

 -P: Sender source port. If not specified, DEFAULT_SOURCE_SENDER_PORT
     (10001) will be used.

 -h: Displays the help on various options.

The sample Sender is started next as :

  receiver -m macarena.cs.wustl.edu:9091

 -m: specifies the multicast session address that both client and
     server subscribe to for QoS events.

 -n: Option to be used by senders only to specify the destination
     address. This option is overriden if a multicast address is also
     specified through the -m option.

 -p: Protocol to be used. Could be udp or tcp. Default is udp.

 -P: Sender source port. If not specified, DEFAULT_SOURCE_SENDER_PORT
     (10001) will be used.

 -h: Displays the help on various options.
