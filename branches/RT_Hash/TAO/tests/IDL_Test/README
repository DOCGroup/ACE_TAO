This test is a collection of IDL files that once caused IDL compiler
or C++ compiler errors, plus a dummy main.cpp for the build. There is
no execution check in this test, the only outcome of interest being
the build. The examples in the IDL files come from many sources - some
are made from scratch, some are adapted from other tests, and some are
adapted from examples sent in by ACE and/or TAO users. To all of these
last, many thanks for your help in digging out these bugs!

Each IDL file contains examples that are related, either by the IDL
type involved or by the context in which the error occurs. As new bugs
are uncovered and fixed, new examples will be added to the suite, to
ensure that the bugs do not recur.

To build the test files, type 'make' at the command line. The TAO IDL
compiler will open each IDL file in the directory and generate code
that will then be compiled by the C++ compiler on your platform.

To run the test, type 'main' at the command line. The generation of
correct IOR prefixes in pragma.idl is checked in the body of main().
The rest of the .idl files need only to build cleanly. To test the 
client/server functionality of the various IDL types and operations, 
see the test suite in ACE_wrappers/TAO/tests/Param_Test.

The generated code from reopened_modules.idl is not included in the
Makefile per se. Platforms without namespaces cannot handle
reopened modules, so reopened_modulesC.cpp and reopened_modulesS.cpp
have been conditionally included in a file called namespace_check.cpp.
On platforms without namespaces, the IDL compiler will output a 
warning that the generated code may not compile, each time a module
is reopened in the .idl file. If seen when building this test, the
warning can safely be ignored. It can also be ignored if you are
cross-compiling onto a platform that has namespaces.
