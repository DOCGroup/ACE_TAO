<center><h1>Powers with the Build Czar</h1></center>
  <P>
  This document grants extensive privileges and powers to the Czar,
  but those privileges impose several responsabilities that must be fulfilled,
  failure to do so may result in some form of revolution
  (picture a firing squad).
  </P>

  <P>
  Previous generations of the honorable royal family have automated
  the build process as much as possible, but all machines require attention:
  the build Czar must keep a constant vigil, lest some runaway process
  stops working and a critical bug scapes into the wild.
  </P>

  <P>Typically a runaway build is detected because on its next
    execution an email indicating that the build is
    <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
    is received.
    The same email is also sent when a build is abruptly terminated (for
    example because the machine running the build crashed).
    Most of the time,
    a test is not making progress and must be terminated,
    the build then runs to completion.
    If the machine crashed then it is necessary to go into the build
    directory and remove the
    <CODE>auto_compile/.disable</CODE>
    file, so the next execution can complete successfully.
    Occasionally the build fails because there is a CVS conflict,
    there is not enough disk space or some similar problem,
    in these cases the build Czar is encouraged to request adviced
    from previous generations in the royal family they will
    be happy to come back from retirement to provide advice and help
    if needed.
  </P>
  <P>The build Czar should also investigate the errors and warnings
    reported by a build,
    contact the person or persons responsible for the failed build and
    prompt them to fix the situation. If that process above fails the
    build Czar should  request help from a volunteer or proceed to fix
    the problem himself/herself.  If there is no available
    backup/volunteer and the build Czar  is busy, he/she will be
    forced to excomunicate the original developer and report him or
    her to the highest court of the land for whatever punishment is
    deemed appropriate (lashing or bone breaking where not prohibited
    by law).
  </P>
  <P>It is extremely important to fix broken builds within the day,
    otherwise the errors tend to accumulate and once the process
    breaks down it is extremely hard to recover,
    in other words,
    the term as a build Czar can extend beyond your expectations if
    the builds are not clean again.
  </P>
