Shows how applications can use the ACE_Token_Collection utility.  This
example creates three collections and spawns a thread to operate on
each.  The threads use the collective acquire, renew, and release
features of ACE_Token_Collection.

Here are the command-line parameters for collection:

./collection:
[-h <remote host>]
[-p <remote port>]
[-n <iterations>]
[-d debug]

To run the collection locally with debugging info, type

% ./collection -d

To run the collection remotely with debugging info, first start a
token server and the type:

% ./collection -d -h <token-server-host> -p <token-server-port>

The -n <iterations> option is to control how often each thread
iterates on the acquire, renew, release cycle.
