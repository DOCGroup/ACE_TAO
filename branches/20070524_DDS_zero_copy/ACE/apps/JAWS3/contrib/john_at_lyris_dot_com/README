I have not looked to see what you're using the signal handler for, but
just FYI, in our own Unix/Windows command line applications, we have a
Windows handler for ctrl-c and ctrl-break, which we use as substitutes
for signal handling on Windows.  I can give you source code for doing
this if you like, if you think it is a useful substitute.

There are two functions you need.  A handler routine and a routine
which registers that handler.  The SetConsoleCtrlHandler() Windows
function set the handler, and then they handler just receives a signal
and returns either a true or false to ban on whether it was handled or
not.

Note that is only works in a console mode application and not in a
graphical application.  The code below is copied directly out of
production source code working for several years, so there should not
be any bugs in it.


bool PlatformSpecificInitialize() {

     LYRIS_PROFILE("PlatformSpecificInitialize");

     bool retval;
     retval = SetConsoleCtrlHandler(handler_routine, TRUE);
     if (retval != TRUE) {
          trace("Note: SetConsoleCtrlHandler() did not succeed.");
     }

     retval = SetConsoleTitle(APPLICATION_NAME.c_str());
     if (retval != TRUE) {
          trace("Note: setConsoleTitle() did not succeed.");
     }

     return lyris_success;
};

     LYRIS_PROFILE("handler_routine");

immediately, and cleanly
          if (handled_already == false) {
               handled_already = true;
               //lyris_Thread::ExitApplicationNow();
               DisplayMessage("Shutting down as requested");
