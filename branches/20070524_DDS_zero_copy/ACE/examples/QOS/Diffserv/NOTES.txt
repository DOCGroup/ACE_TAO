Linux notes
===========

Under Linux kernel 2.4, the following DSCP values
could not be set with the setsockopt call
unless you run as root:

EF, CS5, CS6, CS7

Also, under Linux 2.4.2 kernel, if I could successfully
set the 2 bits reserved for ECN in the Diffserv Field to 
0x00 or 0x02.  However, the setsockopt call would
fail if it was set to 0x01 or 0x03.

According to the Linux Diffserv mailing list:

FreeBSD notes 
=============
Under FreeBSD 4.3, I encountered no problems
setting DSCP or ECN values, and I could set all
these values without being root.
However, FreeBSD seems to be more fussy about the size of the parameter
you pass into the setsockopt call.  Make sure you get the
size right, and cast it properly, ie. don't cast a short, or some
other size.


Solaris notes
=============
No problems setting DSCP or ECN values.
