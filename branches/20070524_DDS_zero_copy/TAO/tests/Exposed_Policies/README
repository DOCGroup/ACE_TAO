$Id$

This directory contains a test case used to verify that the client
exposed policies get embedded correctly in the IOR and exposed to the
client in the object reference.

The policy tested are:

    - PriorityModelPolicy
    - PriorityBandedConnectionPolicy
    - ClientProtocolPolicy

The policy can be set at POA level or at object level. The policies
that have to be associated with a POA or with an object are specified
using a configuration file. As an example we can consider the file
POA.cfg that contains the policy used to create a child POA:

File: POA.cfg

        IOR_Source poa.ior

        Priority 10

        Priority_Bands 5
        Priority_Range 3 5
        Priority_Range 7 11
        Priority_Range 5 9
        Priority_Range 1 5
        Priority_Range 10 15


The tag used to decribe the information have the following meaning:

    - IOR_Source: Defines the name of the file that has to be used to
                  store the IOR of the object created.

    - Priority: Defines a CORBA::Priority value.

    - Priority_Bands: Defines the number of priority bands.

    - Priority_Range: Defines the priority range associated with a
      priority_band.


The policies value that are specified in the config file can be used
to set the policy at POA level or to override those police on a Object
level basis (beaware that the only policy that can be overridden on an
Object basis is the Priority).

In particular the option "-POAConfigFile" let you specify the policy
that have to be used when the POA is created. While the option
"-ObjectConfigFile" let you set the options on a object basis
overriding the policies that were set at a POA level.


When the test is run two object are created, of this object one has
the same priority that where specified when the POA was created, while
the other ovverride some of them as prescribed in the config file
specified with the option "-ObjectConfigFile".

The config file are used by the client side to verify that what is
embedded in the IOR is correct.


USAGE:

   server -ORBSvcConf server.conf -ORBendpoint iiop://<hostaddr>:0/priority=<priority> -ORBendpoint iiop://<hostaddr>:0/priority=<priority> -POAConfigFile <config_file_name> -ObjectConfigFile <config_file_name>

   client -POAConfigFile <config_file_name>
          -ObjectConfigFile <config_file_name>


EXAMPLE:

      $ server -POAConfigFile POA.cfg -ObjectConfigFile Object.cfg

      $ client -POAConfigFile POA.cfg -ObjectConfigFile Object.cfg

      $ client -POAConfigFile POA.cfg -ObjectConfigFile Object.cfg
