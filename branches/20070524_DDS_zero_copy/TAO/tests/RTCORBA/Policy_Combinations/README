Description:

Test combines and tests several RT policies in different ways.

- The IDL interface has two methods: method() and
  prioritized_method().

- The client sets its thread to the default priority, calls method()
  which returns a priority.  If the priority returned is different
  from <TAO_INVALID_PRIORITY>, the client sets its thread to the
  priority returned by the server and calls prioritized_method()

- The servant returns the <client_priority_> member in method().  In
  prioritized_method(), it makes sure that the thread running the
  upcall is at priority <server_priority_>.  These two members allow
  several different policies to be tested with the same code.

- In addition to testing servants in the RootPOA and in a simple child
  POA, the following policy combinations are tested in this example:
  ________________________________________________________________________________

  Thread-pool    BANDS   PRIORITY MODEL    Client Priority    Server Priority
  ________________________________________________________________________________

  Default Pool     NO   CLIENT_PROPAGATED        3                  3
  Default Pool     NO   SERVER_DECLARED          3                  5
  Without Lanes    NO   CLIENT_PROPAGATED        1                  1
  Without Lanes    NO   SERVER_DECLARED          1                  5
  With Lanes       NO   CLIENT_PROPAGATED        2                  2
  With Lanes       NO   SERVER_DECLARED          3                  5
  Default Pool    YES   CLIENT_PROPAGATED        3                  3
  Default Pool    YES   SERVER_DECLARED          1                  5
  Without Lanes   YES   CLIENT_PROPAGATED        1                  1
  Without Lanes   YES   SERVER_DECLARED          3                  5
  With Lanes      YES   CLIENT_PROPAGATED        3                  2
  With Lanes      YES   SERVER_DECLARED          1                  5

  where the priorities are relative to the minimum priority of the
  thread scheduling policy used for the test.

- This test uses the -ORBPriorityMapping continuous option.
