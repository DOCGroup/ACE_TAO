@page CSD_Strategy TestApp README File

    This directory contains the test applications. This test tries to 
estimate how fast the CSD strategy can handle requests.

    To run the test use the run_test.pl script as below. The number 
parameter is the trail id for the server used to identify the test 
results when running same test multiple times using single script. 
The id should be positive integer.


$ ./run_test.pl 1

   1 remote client, 1 servant, 1 orb thread (main thread), 1 csd strategy thread

$ ./run_test.pl remote 1 

   40 remote clients, 1 servant, 1 orb thread (main thread), 1 csd strategy thread
  
$ ./run_test.pl collocated 1

   10 collocated clients, 1 servant, 1 orb thread (main thread), 1 csd strategy thread

$ ./run_test.pl remote_orbthreads 1

   40 remote clients, 1 servant, 5 orb threads, 1 csd strategy thread

$ ./run_test.pl remote_servants 1 

   40 remote clients, 5 servants, 5 orb threads, 1 csd strategy thread

$ ./run_test.pl remote_csdthreads 1

   40 remote clients, 5 servants, 1 orb thread (main thread), 5 csd strategy threads

$ ./run_test.pl remote_big 1 

   40 remote clients, 10 servants, 4 orb threads, 5 csd strategy threads

$ ./run_test.pl collocated_big 1 

   40 collocated clients, 10 servants, 1 orb thread (main thread), 5 csd strategy threads

$ ./run_test.pl big 1 

   40 remote clients, 40 collocated clients, 10 servants, 4 orb threads, 5 csd strategy threads

$ ./run_test.pl remote_huge 1

   400 remote clients, 10 servants, 4 orb threads, 5 csd strategy threads

$ ./run_test.pl collocated_huge 1

   40 collocated clients, 10 servants, 1 orb thread (main thread), 20 csd strategy threads


   The script returns 0 if the test was successful, and prints
out the number of requests, the total time to dispatch these requests
and the average number of requests the CSD strategy dispatched
per millisecond.
