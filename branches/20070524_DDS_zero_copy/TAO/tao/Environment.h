   * @brief Environment
   *
   * A CORBA::Environment is a way to automagically ensure that
   * exception data is freed -- the "var" class for Exceptions.  It
   * adds just a bit of convenience function support, helping
   * classify exceptions as well as reducing memory leakage.
   * The thread has a default environment to simplify porting
   * between platforms that support native C++ exceptions and those
   * that don't. This is a TSS resource (always), but with a twist:
   * if the user creates a new environment the old one is "pushed"
   * (actually the new one remembers it), eventually the new
   * environment destructor pops itself from the stack and we
   * recover the old environment.  This means that if the user
   * create a new environment and somebody calls a function using
   * the default one the exception will still be received in the
   * environment created by the user.  The only drawback is that
   * environments life time must nest properly, this shouldn't be a
   * problem because environments are usually created on the stack,
   * but, the spec allows their creation on the heap and/or as class
   * members; we need to investigate the tradeoffs and take a
   * decision.
