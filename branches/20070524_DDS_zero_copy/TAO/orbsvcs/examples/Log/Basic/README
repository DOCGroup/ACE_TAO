Telecom Log Service (TLS) Client example
----------------------------------------
This is a simple example example to show how to create a basic log and write events
to the Log.

To run this example:
1) You need a running Naming Service, $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service
2) You need a running Log Service, $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Logging_Service
3) ./tls_client

The client locates the log service factory from the naming service.
Then it creates a DsLogAdmin::BasicLog does the following operations:
- writes records, query records, delete records.
