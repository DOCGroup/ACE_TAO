 *
 * @brief Abstract base class for the filter hierarchy.
 *
 * The per-consumer filtering mechanisms.
 * The EC needs to filter data passed to the consumers, so it can
 * correctly satisfy its subscription requirements.
 * This filtering can include correlations, sequences, timeouts,
 * etc. each consumer can request different filtering criteria.
 * Different filtering objects are associated with each consumer,
 * the filters are organized in a hierarchical structure,
 * corresponding to the subscription "expression" that the events
 * must satisfy.
 * The hierarchy is constructed using the "Builder" pattern.
 *
 * <H2>Memory Management</H2>
 * It does *not* assume ownership of its parent.
