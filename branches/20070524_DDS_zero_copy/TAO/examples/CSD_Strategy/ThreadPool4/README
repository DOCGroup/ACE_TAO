Description:

This is another test showing the use of a Custom Servant Dispatching
(CSD) Strategy.  This test uses the reference implementation, known as the
Thread Pool CSD Strategy.  This tests collocated requests.

The server application creates two servants, each with a different child
POA.  One of the POAs has a CSD Strategy applied to it, and the other does
not.  Also created are two collocated callback servants to test the
passing of object references as arguments in collocated requests.

The server activates a new thread for each of the two collocated "clients".

To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

        The script returns 0 if the test was successful.
