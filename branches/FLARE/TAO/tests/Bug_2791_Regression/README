This test confirms that the reference count for a valuetype factory is decremented when the
valuetype factory is unregistered via ORB::unregister_value_factory().  Before, the reference
count was not being decremented, leaving the factory in memory.  The test registers and
unregisters a valuetype factory and then removes its own reference to it, and checks that
the valuetype factory destructor is called.

_Expected Success Output_

Registering factory reference
Unregistering factory reference
Value factory destructor flag: 0
Actively removing reference
MessageFactory: destructor invoked
Value factory destructor flag: 1
Shutting down / destroying ORB
Test passed: value factory destructor was invoked as expected

_Expected Regression Output_

Registering factory reference
Unregistering factory reference
Value factory destructor flag: 0
Actively removing reference
Value factory destructor flag: 0
Shutting down / destroying ORB
Test failed: value factory destructor was not invoked
