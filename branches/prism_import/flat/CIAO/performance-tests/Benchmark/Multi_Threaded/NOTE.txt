PRE Condition:
=============
This test assumes that there is an appropriate svc.conf file present in 
$CIAO_ROOOT/tools/ComponentServer. Moreover, the Component Server does not
curerntly expose interfaces to configure multi-threading. Hence, this
experiment, will produce the desired results *only* when this feature has been
added in CIAO. Till then, the server will run in single-threaded mode.

Similarly, the client also requires the svc.conf file that enables
multi-threading. This file is present in this directory.

The svc.conf file required for this experiment can be obtained from 
$TAO_ROOT/performance-tests/Latency/Thread_Pool
