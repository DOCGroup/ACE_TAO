This documentation is composed to be as a manual for using CADML tool kit.
(http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~gokhale/cosmic.html)


The tool bases on GME(Generic Modeling Environment) developed at ISIS of
Vanderbilt University. To download the newest version of GME please go to:

==========================================================================
CADML(Component Assemble and Deployment Modeling Language) is a modeling
paradigm designed to help user to generate the cad(component assembly
descriptor) file. This XML file will be used by the CCM deployment tool to
instantiate/assembly/deploy components.

Note: This tool has been tested with GME3 Release r3.4.29 and r3.10.13
==========================================================================
To test the tool:

1. Download GME3 and install it on a Windows box.

2. Put bin/xerces-c_2_2_0D.dll and bin/Xalan-C_1_5_0D.dll in your system path.
   Note: You can download the file from www.apache.org

3. Open GME3 then file->Import XML...select the Meta_CADML.xml..
   ->select "Create Project File"->next->store the file( make sure that
   the "icons" folder is in the same directory as the generated XMP file);

4. Go to the part browser then double click on "CADML" to expend the tree.

5. Click on any childer model so a new window shows up.

6. file->Run-Interpreter->interpreter->ok->select place to save paradigm file
   ->yes to register paradigm.

7. Open another GME then repeat step 3,4 on  BuildingBlocks.xml

8. In the part browser find any model inside the "Product_Scenarios" folder.

9. Menu file->register component->new->find the bin/CADML.dll file.

10.Menu file->run interpreter->then follow the instruction.

11.Follow the instruction.

12.Look at the generated cad file to see the result.

==========================================================================
This tool conforms the old CCM D&C spec, we are currently working on the
new tool kit.
==========================================================================
The source code will be available soon in our CVS repository.
If you have any question please contact lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu.

To Compile the interpreter.
Because of the extensive usage of LIBs from the third party, compiling CADML could
be troublesome. Please be patient and follow the following instructions.
Currently CADML could be compiled under VC6. VC7 support will be added in soon.

-Steps:

1. Download the latest version of UDM(1.76) from
   http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/mobies/

2. Download Xerces Binary(2.2.0) and Xalan(1.5) for C++ from
   http://www.apache.org/
   Note: The current CADML dosen't compile with newer version of Xerces and Xalan.

3. Set system variables:
   XERCES_ROOT: where directory "xerces-c_2_2_0-win32" is.
   XALAN_ROOT:  where directory "xml-xalan\c" is.
   UDM_ROOT: where directory "UdmBinary-1.76_w32" is.
   GME_ROOT: where the installation directory of "GME" is.

5. Add the path where the Xerces and Xalan dll resides to the system path.

4. Open the project "Component" with VC6, build the corresponsive dll.

6. Now inside the CADML paradigm in GME, you can register your own CADML*.dll as the
   interpreter for the paradigm.

============================================================================
============================================================================
Note: I have been receiving reports from our users of CADML about the dll registration problem

Please make sure that you have followed the steps above carefully and reboot your Windows
box if necessary. If the problem persists then you might need some dlls in the windows Visual Studio
distribution. If you have Visual studio 6 then please open the tool in the software pack named "Depends"
to view the dependency of the component.dll. Most likely your system don't have some of the dlls.
If you don't have VC6 please go to http://www.dependencywalker.com and use the tool to see the dependency
and make sure that you have all the requried dlls in your system path. If you find out that some dlls are
missing and you can't find them please email me and I will ship the file to you.
