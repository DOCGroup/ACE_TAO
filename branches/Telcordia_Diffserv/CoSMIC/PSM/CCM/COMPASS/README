This directory contains a meta-model of a Component Configuration/Packaging
modeling language called COMPASS. For more information on the meta-model
and how to use the modeling paradigm, please refer to
docs/TechnicalManual.doc and docs/UserManual.doc. This document outlines
the steps that need to be done for building the interpreter so that it can
be used to build models.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

1. Generic Modeling Environment (GME) version 3.10.13 or later, available
   from http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/index.html. Please
   note that if you are using GME 3.10.13, you will have to download
   BON.ZIP from http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/education/mic/BON.zip, and
   unzip it to %GME_INSTALL_ROOT%\SDK\BON.

2. Microsoft Windows (NT,2000,XP)

3. Microsoft Visual Studio VC6 SP5. Note that this release of COMPASS has
   not been tested with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.

4. Xerces Library, version 2.4.0 or later available from
   http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi/ for building the
   interpreter. After installation, XERCESCROOT should point to the
   installation root for Xerces. The interpreter project expects
   $(XERCESCROOT)\lib to contain the Xerces library and
   $(XERCESCROOT)\include to contain the header files. Also make sure that
   $(XERCESCROOT)\bin is in your PATH.

5. STLPort, version 4.6.0 or later, available from
   http://www.stlport.org/download.html. Builder Object Network (BON) needs
   a C++ standards compliant STL implementation like the one provided by
   STLPort. Hopefully this dependency on STLPort will be revisited when
   support for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET is added.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Open GME. Click File->Import XML. Choose paradigms/Compass.xme. Click
   OK. In the next dialog box, leave "Create Project File" checked, click
   Next. Leave CompassML as the File Name, and choose Open. File should
   have successfully imported.

2. Interpret the Project by clicking on the "i" button on the toolbar.
   Click OK to any dialog box that pops up including the one that asks if
   you want to register this paradigm.

3. Fire up Microsoft Visual Studio and open
   interpreters/Bon2Component.dsw. Build the workspace. The final part of
   the build step will automatically register the paradigm interpreter.

3. Now open another GME instance. Click File->Import XML. Choose
   examples/HUDisplay.xme. Click OK. In the next dialog box, leave "Create
   Project File" checked, click Next. Leave HUDisplay as the File Name, and
   choose Open. You can view the different folders by double-clicking on
   the tree hierarchy on the part browser. Clicking on the "i" button or
   right-click->Interpret on any element from the part browser, should
   generate the descriptor corresponding to that element. If you want to
   generate all the descriptors, select all elements by shift+click, then
   right-click and click Interpret. This should generate all the
   descriptors.
