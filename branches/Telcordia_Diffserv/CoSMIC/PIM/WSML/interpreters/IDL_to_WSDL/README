                  IDL To WSDL Converter

A pluggable back end used with the IDL compiler parser
and command line processor, this tool converts
IDL constructs into their corresponding WSDL equivalents,
in an XML file.

COMPILING:

Use the provided .mpc file to generate a project or makefile to
compile the pluggable back end library and the executable.
Make sure the TAO IDL compiler front end is already built.

EXECUTABLE NAME:

idl_to_wsdl

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:

All the usual front-end command line options that apply to the IDL compiler
(such as path includes) work with this tool as well, since the IDL compiler
front end is simply reused. The options -? or -h will display a usage
message, including both front end and back end options. For a complete
list of IDL compiler command line options and a description of each, see
TAO/docs/compiler.html.

BACKEND OPTIONS:

-o <path> Also works the same as with the IDL compiler, setting the
output directory, overriding the default, which is the directory of
execution.

-x <filename> Name of the generated WSDL file.

None of the other backend options display have been implemented or
tested yet.

IDL CONSTRUCTS NOT YET SUPPORTED:

- typedefs of constructed types (structs, unions, exceptions),
  interfaces, and valuetypes
  
- arrays

- sequence and array operation parameters and return types

- forward declarations

- component ports other than facets
