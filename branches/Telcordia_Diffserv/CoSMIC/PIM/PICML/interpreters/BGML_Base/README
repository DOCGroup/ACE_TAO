This directory has the base library that BGML interpreters depends
on. To compile the files in this directory, do the following:

1: Run the mwc.pl file to generate the workspace for compiling
   the source files

$> mwc.pl 

2: Compiling the workspace should generate the library and also 
   put the library in $ACE_ROOT/lib file

3: To compile and run the benchmarking files generated from BGML,
   please set an environment variable called BGML_HOME pointing to
   this directory.
