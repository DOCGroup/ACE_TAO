This directory contains the meta-model of Platform-Independent Component
Modeling Language (PICML). This document outlines the steps that need to be
done for registering the paradigm and building the interpreter so that it
can be used to build models and generate descriptors.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

1. Generic Modeling Environment (GME) version 4.5.18, available from
   http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/index.html.

2. Microsoft Windows (NT,2000,XP)

3. Microsoft Visual Studio VC6 SP5. Note that this release of PICML will
   not work with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.

4. Xerces Library, version 2.5.0 available from
   http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~kitty/PICML/xerces-c-2_5_0-win32-vc6.zip
   After installation, XERCESCROOT should point to the installation root
   for Xerces. Rename the following files under $(XERCESCROOT)/lib:

   xerces-c_2.lib -> xerces-c_2_5.lib
   xerces-c_2D.lib -> xerces-c_2_5D.lib

   The interpreter project expects $(XERCESCROOT)\lib to contain the Xerces
   library and $(XERCESCROOT)\include to contain the header files. Also
   make sure that $(XERCESCROOT)\bin is in your PATH.

5. STLPort, version 4.6.0 or later, available from
   http://www.stlport.org/download.html. Builder Object Network (BON)
   version 2 needs a C++ standards compliant STL implementation like the
   one provided by STLPort. Please compile the iostreams library included
   with STLPort. Please make sure that the version of STL available in the
   include path includes STLPort's files before the files shipped with
   MSVC. One easy way is to add %MSVCDir%\Include\STLport before
   %MSVCDir%\Include in the include files section of Directories Tab under
   Tools->Options.

6. GReAT version 1.3.0 available from
   http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/projects/mobies/downloads.asp

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Registering the paradigms
-------------------------

1. Open GME. Click File->Import XML. Choose paradigms/PICML.xme. Click OK.
   In the next dialog box, leave "Create Project File" checked, click Next.
   Leave PICML as the File Name, and choose Open. File should have
   successfully imported.

2. Interpret the Project by clicking on the "i" button on the toolbar.
   Click OK to any dialog box that pops up including the one that asks if
   you want to register this paradigm.

3. Alternatively, you can do File->Register Paradigms->Add From File.
   Select pardigms/PICML.xmp and hit close.

4. Now you can create models using PICML.

Building and Registering the interpreter
----------------------------------------

1. Open the workspace interpreters/packaging/PackageComponent.dsw. Choose
   Win32 Debug (unless you have a powerful machine), and Compile. If you
   get a error, about LoadLibrary ".\Debug\PackageComponent.DLL" failed,
   open a command window and change to PICML/interpreters/packaging/Debug
   directory. Type the following:

   regsvr32 /c PackageComponent.dll

   You should see a message saying that the DLL was successfully
   installed.

2. If everything went well, in the previous step, you should be able to
   import the example model under PICML/examples/RobotAssembly.xme. Once
   the model is imported, click on the "U" button on the component task
   bar to generate the descriptors.

If you have problems with step 1, please send me mail at:
