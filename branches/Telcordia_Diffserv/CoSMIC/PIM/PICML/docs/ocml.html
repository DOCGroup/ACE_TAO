<h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>
  Options Configuration Modeling Language (OCML) is a language developed to
  provide constraints and dependencies of the options used to customize the
  libraries and tools used by the application developers. OCML is defined in
  the GME meta-modeling paradigm to form a base for the tool specific option
  rule definitions. GME as a sophisticated modeling environment, is used to
  visually represent the OCML and the tool specific option rule definitions.
  In GME, OCML is defined as a meta-model for the tool-specific option rule
  definitions. This section explains the general structure of an OCML model
  and the outputs resulted from an interpretation process.

<h2> Creating a new OCML model </h2>
  <p>
  For each application or library the tool developer should define a new OCML
  model. To create a new OCML model in GME:
    <ul>
    <li> Select the File -&gt; New Project menu item. </li>
    <li> Select <em> OCML </em> from the list of paradigms. </li>
    <li> Select <em> Create project file. </em> </li>
    <li> Give a name to save your model. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  You can insert two different kind of models into your project:
  (1) Option Category, and (2) Rule.
  </p>

<h3> OCML options paradigm </h3>
  <p>
  To add a new category, right click on the
  model tree and select Insert Model -&gt; Option Category. After you give a
  name to your category you can double click it to define it. Options
  hierarchically reside in the <em>option categories.</em> An
  <em> option category </em> may include other option categories recursively.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are five elements an option category can contain in addition to other
  option categories. (see <a href="#figure_ocml_options_aspect">
  Figure: Options Aspect </a>)
  </p>
  <a name="#figure_ocml_options_aspect"/>

  <ul>
    <li> <b> Boolean Option: </b>
         Boolean options are the options which can take one of the only two
         possible values, <em> true </em> and <em> false. </em>
         </li>
    <li> <b> Integer Option: </b>
         Options having an integer numeric value are named as
         <em>integer options. </em>
         </li>
    <li> <b> String Option: </b>
         Options having an alphanumeric value are named as
         <em>string options. </em>
         </li>
    <li> <b> Enum Option: </b>
         Options which can be selected from a set of values are named as
         <em>enum options. </em> When you double click on an
         <em> enum option </em> you see that new elements named
         <em> enum items </em> can be added to the enum options. The
         enumerated values which can be contained in <em> enum options </em>
         are represented with <em>enum items.</em>
         </li>
    <li> <b> Flag Option: </b>
         The <em>flag option </em> can be set to a combination of the values
         from the given value set. Similar to the <em> enum options </em>
         flag options contains <em> flag items </em> to represent value for
         the flag option.
         </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Each of the option elements has one common attribute, <em>description.</em>
  You can add textual description describes the effects of this option. In
  addition to the pure textual descriptions, you can add HTML tags for better
  visualization.
  </p>
<a name="#ocml_rule_paradigm"/>
<h3> OCML rule paradigm </h3>
  <p>
  The second model you can insert to your OCML model is
  <em >rule definitions. </em> To add a new rule definitions model, right click
  on the model tree and select Insert Model -&gt; Rule. After you give a name
  to the new rule model you can double click it to define it.
  A <em> rule </em>is the combination of logical operations. A <em> rule </em>
  can contain other <em> rules </em> or references to <em> options </em>
  associated with the following logical operators. (see
  <a href="#figure_ocml_rule_aspect"> Figure: Rule Aspect </a>)
  </p>
  <a name="#figure_ocml_rule_aspect"/>
  <img src="ocml_rule_aspect.png"/>
  <ul>
    <li> <b> AND operator: </b> Logical <em> and </em> operator.
         </li>
    <li> <b> OR operator: </b> Logical <em> or </em> operator.
         </li>
    <li> <b> NOT operator: </b> Logical <em> not </em> operator.
         </li>
    <li> <b> IF operator: </b> Logical <em> if </em> operator.
         </li>
    <li> <b> IFF operator: </b> Logical <em> if and only if </em> operator.
         </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  A rule is defined by connecting references to the options to the logical
  operators. Assuming we have two options such as enum option: 
  <em> concurrency </em> (which can have values, <em> single threaded </em> and
  <em> multi threaded </em>) and integer option: <em> thread count. </em> We
  want to define a rule such as <em> If the concurrency is set to single
  threaded the thread count cannot have any other value than 1. </em>
  If we would like to write this in a textual form it would be,
  </p><p>
  <code> concurrency = single_threaded =&gt; thread_count=1 </code>.
  </p><p>
  To define this rule in our OCML rule model, we need to follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Open the model window containing the <em> concurrency </em> option.
         </li>
    <li> Right click on the <em> concurrency </em> option then select
         <em> copy. </em>
         </li>
    <li> Open the rule model window.
         </li>
    <li> Right click on the empty window area then select
         Paste Special -&gt; As Reference.
         </li>
    <li> Follow the same steps for the <em> thread count </em> model.
         </li>
    <li> Now you rule model should contain two option references,
         <em> concurrency </em> and <em> thread count. </em> 
         Insert a <em> IF </em> operator into your model by dragging it from
         the <em> Rule Aspect </em> elements view.
    <li> Select <em> Connect Mode </em> by clicking the connection item with
         a plus sign on it on the tool bar residing at the left side of the
         GME.
         </li>
    <li> Make the connection from <em> concurrency -&gt; single threaded </em>
         option item to the <em> IF </em> operator.
         </li>
    <li> Then connect the <em> IF </em> operator to the <em> thread count </em>
         option. When you make the second connection, GME will pop up a window
         to show you possible connection types, because we want to enforce a
         constant value for the integer option we will select the
         <em> Integer Equality Association. </em>
	 </li>
    <li> Click on the connection and set the value of it to 1.
         </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The final look of the rule is given in the Figure below.</p>

<h2> OCML Interpreter </h2>
  <p>
  The modeled options and rules can be exported into an xml file by invoking
  the OCML interpreter registered with the OCML paradigm. To do this, simply
  click the <em> OCML Interpreter </em> button on tool bar. Then a save file
  dialog will appear asking a file name to save the model. The exported file
  will be used by the <em> OCML configurator </em> which is a graphical user
  interface for editing options.
  </p>
<a name="#ocml_option_configurator"/>
<h2> Option Configurator </h2>
  <p>
  <em> Option Configurator </em> provides a graphical user interface for users
  to enter values for the options modeled within the GME OCML paradigm.
  Different editing areas are used for different option types (i.e. while 
  integer and string options are edited in a text area, for the enum option
  the configurator displays a combo box where all the possible values are
  shown and one can be selected.)
  </p>
  <p>
  The value in the <em> description </em> attribute of the OCML modeling
  elements are displayed in a text area to provide assistance for the user.
  The rules defined in the rules paradigm are enforced by the OCML Configurator
  (i.e. the rule defined in the section <a href="#ocml_rule_paradigm"> OCML
  rule paradigm </a> will prevent the <em> thread count </em> option to have
  a value different then 1, if the <em> concurrency </em> option's value
  is <em> single threaded. </em>
