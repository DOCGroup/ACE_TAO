INSTRUCTIONS FOR INTEGRATING TOOL META-MODELS WITH PICML
--------------------------------------------------------
Step 1:
  - Import the Meta Model of IDML (IDML.xme)
  - Run the MetaGME to UML Interpreter (This is the only interpreter registered
    with the paradigm)
  - Save it in the following directory (PICML/paradigms). File saved will be IDML-UML.mga

Step 2:
  - Open PICML and refresh library. During refresh process you will be prompted
    for a "Conector String"
  - Using the dialogue box, point this to the IDML.mga path
  - Check for Null references by Edit -> Search for Null References menu option

Step 3:
  - Integrate you meta-model with PICML

Step 4:
  - Use the Meta-GME to UML Interpreter (Comes with the installation of GREAT)
    to generate the PICML-UML.mga. Make sure that this file is put in the PICML/paradigms
    directory

Step 5:
  - Open the PICML-UML.mga and interpret it using the XML interpreter
    (This is the only interpreter registered)
  - This generates the PICML.xml file

Step 6:
  - Use Udm.exe to generate the PICML.h PICML.xsd and PICML.cpp files
     using:
         Udm.exe -v Picml.xml

Step 7:
  - Make sure that you export your paradigm to generate the PICML.xmp file same is
    the case with XML file to generate the PICML.xme file
