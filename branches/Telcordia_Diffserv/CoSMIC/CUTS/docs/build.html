  <title>CUTS : Building CUTS and Installing</title>
</head>

<h2>Supported Platforms for CUTS</h2>
<p>CUTS should be usable on all platforms that support CIAO. Please see
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/CIAO/CIAO-INSTALL.html">
CIAO's installation page</a> for details.</p>

<p>The modeling aspect of CUTS is supported on all platforms that
support CoSMIC. Please see
<a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CoSMIC/html/download.html">
CoSMIC's installation page</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Building and Installing CUTS</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do to build &amp; install CUTS is to set the
environment variable <code>CUTS_ROOT=$COSMIC_ROOT/CUTS</CODE>. Please refer
to the
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/CIAO/CIAO-INSTALL.html">
CIAO installation notes</a> and
<a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CoSMIC/html/download.html">
CoSMIC installation notes</a> for instructions on setting <CODE>$COSMIC_ROOT</CODE>
and <CODE>$CIAO_ROOT</CODE>, respectively. They
are needed since CUTS sits on top of ACE+TAO+CIAO and uses CoSMIC.
Compiling ACE+TAO+CIAO and CoSMIC successfully is the
<b>first</b> requirement for compiling CIAO.</p>

<p>CUTS is divided into several parts, so different installation/building rules
apply to different parts of CUTS. Each of these parts is built and installed
by enabling <i>features</i> at compile time.</p>

<p>To determine which features are needed for your build of CUTS, please refer to
<code>$CUTS_ROOT/default.features</code>. Each feature is a boolean flags that
takes the value 0 or 1. To enable a feature, set the value equal to 1. For example,
if you wanted to build the modeling features of CUTS, you would do the following
in <code>default.features</code>.</p>

<pre>
mfc = 1
udm = 1
boost = 1
</pre>

<p>To build CUTS, we use the Makefile, Project, Workspace Creator (MPC) utility.
Please see the
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/MPC/README">MPC page</a>
for more details. Run MPC on the
<code>$CUTS_ROOT/CUTS.mwc</code> using the following command:</p>

<pre>
$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl [command-line args] CUTS.mwc
</pre>

<blockquote>
Notice: Type <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl --help</code> for help with MPC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After MPC is complete, you can build the CUTS framework and any enabled
features. For example, if you are using gcc, you would use the following
command:</p>

<pre>
gmake
</pre>

<p>Whereas Visual Studio compilers will open the respective solution file
and click the build command.</p>

<div><b>Note for Non-Windows Users</b></div>
<p>If you have enabled any of the features in <code>default.features</code>,
you <b>must</b> enable the features as a macro on the command-line when
building CUTS. For example, if you enabled <code>unixodbc = 1</code>, your
build command should be as follows:</p>

<pre>
gmake unixodbc=1
</pre>

<p>Failure to enable the feature at the command-line will result in any
projects that require that feature to not build.</p>
