This is the README file for the Repository Manager (RM).

Building RM:
In order to be able to compile the RM you need to have ZZIP lib because the RM uses it to read the contents of 
CCM packages. ZZIP itself is a C++ wrapper around ZLIB, thus you will also need ZLIB. In order to compile the RM 
successfully you will need to do the following: 
， Download ZLIB and ZZIP-LIB
， Compile the multi-threaded versions of these libraries
， [on Windows] Create a separate directory for each library; create an include and a lib subdirectory within them. 
Then copy the libraries files in the library subdirectory. Copy zlib.h in the zlib_path/include and copy zziplib.h, 
zzip-conf.h and zzip-msvc.h (for Windows platforms; Linux might have its own file!). This step might be easier if 
you find a binary package of the libraries and just install it.
， Set $ZLIB_ROOT and $ZZIP_ROOT to point to the directories where you placed the libraries and the include files.
， Turn on zzip and zlib in default.features for MPC.
， MPC will handle the rest.

If you want to get the component package through http server:
， Be sure to set JAWS_DOCUMENT_ROOT to the installation path of the RepoMan, i.e., $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager.
， Start JAWS: $ACE_ROOT/apps/JAWS/server/main

Start RM:
， RepositoryManagerDeamon -o

Using RMadmin:
， Install component package: (use BasicSP for example)
  Be sure you have BasicSP.cpk in the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/packages
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -i -l packages/BasicSP.cpk
  or
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -i -l http://127.0.0.1:5432/packages/BasicSP.cpk (If the JAWS is started)
  This will create the BasicSP directory, BasicSP.cpk file and BasicSP.epc file in the 
  $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager/
， Delete component package: (use BasicSP for example)
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -d
， Find component package by its name: (use BasicSP for example)
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -f
， Stop RM:
  > RMadmin -o -s
  This will create the RM_record file in the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager/ which record the 
  names and UUIDs of the installed component packages.
