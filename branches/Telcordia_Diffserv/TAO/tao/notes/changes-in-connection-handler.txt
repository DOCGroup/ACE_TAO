This notes describes the changes to the following libraries and files:

TAO_ROOT/tao:

IIOP_Connection_Handler.{h, cpp}

TAO_ROOT/tao/Strategies:

DIOP_Connection_Handler.{h, cpp}
SCIOP_Connection_Handler.{h, cpp}

A new function was declared in the header files:

int set_dscp_codepoint (CORBA::Long dscp_codepoint);

The .cpp files contained the definition of the above described
function.

Those are the only changes in the files defined above.

These changes allowed TAO Connection Handlers to actually set a 
DiffServ codepoint that was being passed to the function as a
CORBA::Long argument.

There is another function already declared in the TAO Connection
Handlers with the following signature:

/// Set Diff-Serv codepoint on outgoing packets.
int set_dscp_codepoint (CORBA::Boolean set_network_priority);

But that function is used when the RT-CORBA way of setting DiffServ
codepoints are followed in the TAO application. There is clearly a
input argument signature change between the two functions though they
have the same function name.
