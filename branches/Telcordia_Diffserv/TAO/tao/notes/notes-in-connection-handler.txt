In IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp, there are wo functions that
set the DiffServ codepoint:

1. set_dscp_codepoint (CORBA::Boolean ...)
2. set_dscp_codepoint (CORBA::Long ...)

The function #1 is called when the RT-CORBA way of setting DiffServ codepoint
is used, while the function #2 is used, if the DiffServ policy way of setting
DiffServ codepoint is used.

So what it means is that the

get_dscp_codepoint () function defined on the Protocols_Hooks class
can be specialized.

So the function returning the DiffServ codepoint can be named:

get_rt_dscp_codepoint () in RT_CORBA Protocols_Hooks

and

get_dscp_codepoint () in the DiffServ_Protocols_Hooks.
