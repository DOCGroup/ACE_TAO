In order to support the SERVER_DECLARED network priority model, i modifed
Stub.cpp and Stub.h, to follow the design similar to the RT-CORBA
SERVER_DECLARED priority model.

So the following functions were added in Stub.h and Stub.cpp:

void parse_network_priority_policy (ACE_ENV_SINGLE_ARG_DECL);
void exposed_network_priority_model (CORBA::Policy_ptr policy);
CORBA::Policy_ptr exposed_network_priority_model (ACE_ENV_SINGLE_ARG_DECL);

The following private variables were also added:

CORBA::Policy_var network_priority_model_policy_;
CORBA::Boolean network_priority_policy_parsed_;

So when a a client application gets an IOR, and makes a call on the server
to check the SERVER_DECLARED policy, just like te TAO RT-CORBA application
under TAO_ROOT/tests/RTCORBA/Server_Declared, the above code changes
needs to kick in and work to get the client application, the policies
that were defined on the server side.

The design is very similar to the design under RT_Stub.cpp and RT_Stub.h.
