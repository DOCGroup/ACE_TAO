    We begin with <a href="server.cpp">server.cpp</a>
    <UL>
    <P>Abstract:

	  We begin with the server and the acceptor which we developed in
	  our ACE Tutorial 005. We modify these and add new
	  implementation files so as to make the acceptor service dynamically
	  (un)loadable. What we want to do is separate the implementation
	  of the service from its configuration. So, our server will
	  now just act as a daemon waiting for requests.
	  We again enroll the services of the ACE_Reactor to handle
	  events. Everything occurs in a single thread.  <P>
	  
	  This tutorial helps us learn apply the service configurator
	  pattern and make services dynamically configurable. In that
	  process, we are trying to make the acceptor we have developed
	  previously as a dynamically configurable service.
