/**
 *  @file      CC_LockSet.h
 *
 *  $Id$
 *
 *    This class implements the lock set interface from the
 *    concurrency service.
 *
 *    In the present implementation the multiple possesion semantics
 *    is implemented for non-transactional clients. In future
 *    versions this should be changed because the multiple possesion
 *    semantics does not apply to non-transactional clients. This
 *    can be accomplished in the following manner:
 *    - Make a class with the same functiallity as the CC_LockSet
 *      class as a base class for both implementations.
 *    - The functionallity that should be separated out in the
 *      subclasses is the compatible function which should always
 *      return false because no locks can be held simultanously with
 *      non-transactional clients.
 *    - Use these classes from the classes that inherits the
 *      servant properties, i.e. the way CC_LockSet does now.
