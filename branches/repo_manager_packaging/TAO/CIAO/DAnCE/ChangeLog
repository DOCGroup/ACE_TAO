	* Deployment.idl
		modified the Deployment idl to include the new_RepositoryManager IDL

	* new_RepositoryManager.idl
		idl for the new_RepositoryManager deamon which just includes the idl defined 
		within the Deployment namespace

	* new_RepositoryManager.mpc
		mpc file for the RM deamon. Make sure you install ZZIP and ZLIB and specify
		ZZIP_ROOT and ZLIB_ROOT or the RM would not compile. Unfortunately I could not get 
		it to use the zzip and zlib features that come with MPC because there were some issues
 
	* new_RepositoryManager_Impl.cpp
	* new_RepositoryManager_Impl.h
		Implementation files for the deamon

	* RepositoryManager.cpp
		bootstrapping main program for the RM deamon

	* RMadmin.cpp
		client program to communicate with the RM

	* Options.cpp
	* Options.h
		Options singleton files for the RM client

	* packages/inconsistent.cpk
	* packages/package.cpk
		some manually created packages to be used to test the RM

	* Modified_Deployment.xsd
		this is copied out of the XSC_ConfigHandlers dir. I need it for the 
		test of the getPlan function. Otherwise XERCESC fails

	* README.txt
		not much in here for right now. I will add some docs ASAP

	* ZIP_Wrapper.cpp
	* ZIP_Wrapper.h
		Wrapper around ZZIP for easy access.
