   <p>So, by now we have implemented our Acceptor Service: known how to
      initialize, remove, suspend and resume our service. We have the
      server daemon set up to run to accept requests. The only thing
      that is left is the client_handler. We need to declare and define
      the Client_Handler object. We will use the same <I><A
	HREF="../005/Client_Handler.h">Client_Handler.h</A></I> and
    <I><A HREF="../005/Client_Hander.cpp">Client_Handler.cpp</A></I>
      that we used in our ACE Tutorial 005.</p>

   <p>With this, we are done with everything that we want to get our
      Acceptor Service dynamically configurable in addition to the
      actual functionality of the Acceptor.</p>

   <p>To compile, we can use the same <I><A
	  HREF="../005/Makefile">Makefile</A></I> that we used
      previously and make appropriate changes for the new files that
      we added. You could use this <I><A HREF="Makefile">Makefile</A></I>

   <p>Now, lets compile it and be all set to configure our Acceptor
      Service. Let us run our server to start acting as a daemon and
      accept requests.</p>

    <pre>$ ./server </pre>
    
   <p>Obviously, we will want to load our service dynamically and see
      if our Acceptor Service is running as we want it to. For this,
      we need to make an entry in the svc.conf file. 

   <p>The Service Configurator framework reads the entries in the
      svc.conf file in the working directory by default. According to
      the entries in the svc.con file, the framework does the
      needful. You could use a different name for the file like
      server.conf but in that case, we need to explicitly specify to
      the application the configuration file that has to be read using
      the <I>-ORBSvcconf</I> option.

   <p>Coming back to where we were, now we want to make an entry in
      this svc.conf file to load our service. I will show you the
      general format for this entry and then we will make our entry.</p>

      A dynamic service could be initialized as:
 <pre>dynamic service_name type_of_service * location_of_shared_lib:name_of_object "parameters" </pre>

      and a static service is initialized as: 
<pre> static service_name "parameters_sent_to_service_object" </pre>

   <p>Lets start making our entry. The first keyword specifies if this
      is a dynamic service or a static one. Since we want our service
      to be a dynamically configurable one, the first parameter in our
      entry will be <I>dynamic</I>. The next parameter is the name of
      the service that we want to be loaded. This is the same name
      that we specified in the ACE_STATIC_SVC_DEFINE macro. Since our
      service name is Acceptor_Service, that becomes the second
      parameter of our entry. The next argument is the type of the
      service .. as we know already, there are two options:
      Stream or Service_Object. And, we declared our service to be a
      <I>Service_Object</I> in the ACE_STATIC_SVC_DEFINE macro. So, that
      becomes the next parameter. The next entry is the location of
      the shared library which has our service and that is
      Acceptor_Server according to our Makefile. The next parameter is
      the name of the object and finally the list of parameters that
      we want to pass to our service. So, we are now erady to make our
      entry in the svc.conf file to initialize our service.

<pre> dynamic Acceptor_Service Service_Object * ./Acceptor_Server:_make_Acceptor_Service () "" </pre>
 
   <p>Now, we want to reconfigure so that our service will be
      initialized. This could be done by sending a signal which would
      be received eventually by the Reactor listening for requests and
      it would invoke the ACE_Service::reconfigure () method which
      does the reconfiguration of the services.

   <pre>$ kill -1 PID_of_our_server </pre>

    Now, that we know how to initialize our service and actually
    initialized the service .. we could check if our service is
    working good. Ofcourse, the debug statements we left in the init
    method would help .. but to double check !! For this purpose, we
    can use the simple client which we used in our ACE Tutorial
    005. Just compile the <I><A
	HREF="client/client.cpp">client.cpp</A></I> using this <A
      HREF="client/Makefile">Makefile</A> and run it. You can see the
    responses from the service. 

   <p>Now, we can check if we can suspend and resume and finally
      remove the service. The entries for these functionalities are
      very simple unlike the initialization entry.

 <pre>$ suspend Acceptor_Service </pre>
 <pre>$ resume Acceptor_Service  </pre>
 <pre>$ remove Acceptor_Service  </pre>
    
   <p>Lets first suspend the service by commenting out the entry for
      the initialization and making the new entry for suspension in
      the svc.conf file. Now, send a signal as before. The Reactor
      will receive this event and suspend the service. Just to double
      check, you could run our client again and see the response. </p>

   <p>Now, to resume the service, the procedure is the same. Comment
      out other entries and make the entry for the resumption of the
      service. And finally, send a signal. Again, you could run the
      client and see what is happening. But, even before running the
      client, you must have noticed that as soon as you resumed the
      service, you saw some response from the Acceptor_Service. This
      is because, as I explained before, the Reactor will queue the
      request when the service is in suspension mode and send the
      service the queued requests as and when it is active again.

   <p>Finally, lets remove our service.

   <p>So, now we know how to implement a dynamically configurable
      service and how to dynamically configure the service. </p>
