Before compiling the example in The Borland C++ Builder IDE
you must generate the client and server stubs using build_idl.bat.
Please update the location of the tao_idl dependent on your build
configuration. The default location is for a BCB6 Dynamic Debug
configuration.

In the project file you must also update the names of the ACE and
TAO libraries that you use. The configured names are for the BCB6
Dynamic Debug configuration.

This directory illustrates how to write a Borland C++ Builder
application using ACE+TAO.  Please contact Johnny Willemsen
<jwillemsen@remedy.nl> if you have any questions.
