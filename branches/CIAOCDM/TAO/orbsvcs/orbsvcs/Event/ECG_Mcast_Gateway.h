/**
 * @class TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway
 *
 * @brief Implement the builder for setting up Event Channel multicast
 *        gateway.
 *        NOT THREAD-SAFE.
 *
 * This class simplifies creation of federated Event Channels by
 * presenting a simple unified interface for creating and configuring
 * all components needed to federate an Event Channel.
 * Configuration options are described below.
 *
 * NOTE: This class does not own any of the components it creates and
 * its lifetime is independent of theirs.  This class acts purely as a
 * wrapper facade for creating and wiring appropriate components
 * together.
 *
 * @todo This class is an ACE_Service_Object, but the only reason for
 * it is the need for easy configuration using files.  Since
 * ACE_Service_Object provides much more than that, we should look
 * into replacing it with a more lightweight utility that would serve
 * our needs.
 *
 * CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
 * There are two ways to use this class:
 * 1) Use service config file to specify configuration options (which
 *    are described below), and use service configurator to obtain a
 *    an instance of configured TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway in your program.  (See
 *    TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Event/Mcast/Common and
 *    TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Event/Mcast/Simple for an example.)
 *
 * Service config file options:
 *
 * -ECGService <service>
 *  Valid values: sender, receiver, two_way
 *  Specifies whether this gateway should act as a multicast sender of
 *  the events or multicast receiver, or both.
 *
 * -ECGAddressServer <server_type>
 *  Valid values: basic, source, type
 *  Specifies what implementation of the address server should be used
 *  by the gateway.  basic - the same multicast address is returned for
 *  all event headers.  source - multicast addresses are returned based
 *  on the event source, according to the mapping provided at
 *  initialization.  type - multicast addresses are returned based
 *  on the event type, according to the mapping provided at
 *  initialization.
 *
 * -ECGAddressServerArg <arg>
 *  Valid value: arg is a string, whose format requirements are
 *  specific to the implementation of address server used.
 *  Arg is not interpreted by the gateway, but simply passed to the
 *  address server specified by -ECGAddressServer during initialization.
 *  THIS OPTION MUST ALWAYS BE SPECIFIED BY THE USER (there is no
 *  default value for it)
 *
 * -ECGHandler <handler_type>
 *  Valid values: basic, complex, udp
 *  Specifies what implementation of event handler should be used if
 *  gateway is acting as events receiver. basic - a simple event
 *  handler listening on a single mcast address.  complex -
 *  event handler listening on multiple mcast addresses based on
 *  events of interest to consumers.  udp - similar to basic handler,
 *  except listens on udp address as opposed to a multicast group.
 *
 * -ECGTTL <ttl>
 *  Valid values: a number > 0
 *  IP_Multicast time to live value that should be set on a sending socket.
 *  This option matters only if the gateway is acting as a sender of
 *  mcast messages.
 *
 * -ECGNIC <nic>
 *  Valid values: name of the network interface
 *  This interface is used for sending and/or receiving multicast messages.
 *
 * -ECGNonBlocking
 *  Boolean flag to configure if the socket is in blocking or
 *  non-blocking code.  The default is non-blocking.
 *  NOTE: Certain device drivers block the process if the physical
 *        link fails.
 *
 *
 * 2) Create an instance of TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway in your code, on the stack or
 *    dynamically, and use init () method to configure it.  No
 *    configuration files involved.  See service config options above for the
 *    description of configurable options, and init() method below for how
 *    to specify them.
 *
 *
 * Default configuration values (for either use case) can be found in
 * ECG_Defaults.h

   * @brief Helper class to initialize a TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway.
   *
   * The TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway class has several properties that can
   * be configured at initialization time, with default values.  The
   * canonical trick of using a constructor or init() method with
   * multiple arguments does not work because to change the last
   * argument the application developer needs to know all the other
   * defaults.
   *
   * Instead we define a helper class that initializes all the fields
   * to reasonable defaults.  The application only sets the fields
   * that it is interested into, if new fields are added applications
   * do not need to change.
   *
   * With a little trickery we can even eliminate named temporaries:
   *
   * TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway gw;<BR>
   * gw.init(TAO_ECG_Mcast_Gateway::Attributes().set_foo(x).set_bar(y));
   *
   * but we are not implementing that one (detecting errors is too
   * hard without exceptions and ACE+TAO are somewhat shy of
   * exceptions at this point.)
