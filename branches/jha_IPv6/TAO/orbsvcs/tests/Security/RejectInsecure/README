This test helps make sure that authentication is working properly. 
This test checks if we are able to reject unauthenticated secure connections.

The server has a single method which when invoked will return a
boolean value (true) to show that the server has been contacted. We
need to make sure that not only are unsecured connections rejected,
but also unauthorized connections, even if they are secure, are also
rejected.
