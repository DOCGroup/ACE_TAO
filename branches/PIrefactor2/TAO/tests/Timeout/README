# $Id$

	A simple test for timeouts.  The client sets each one of the
policy overrides (object, thread and ORB) and issues requests using
those policies.  The requests take a client controlled amount of time
on the server.

	As the client increases the duration of the request the
requests should start to timeout.

	To run it do:

$ server -o test.ior
$ client -k file://test.ior -l 5 -h 15

	or use the run_test.pl script.
