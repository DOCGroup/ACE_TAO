This directory contains a number of examples that illustrate how to
use the following ACE library components.  If you want to see how
to program using ACE, this is the best place to start reading code and
learning the ACE design.

These examples are roughly divided up according to the class
categories in ACE.  For more information on ACE class categories,
please take a look at $ACE_ROOT/ACE-categories.

	. ASX
		Illustrate various components in the ADAPTIVE Service
		eXecutive, which is a user-level implementation of
		System V STREAMS written in C++.

	. Connection
		Illustrate how the various Acceptor and Connector
		components can be used.

	. IOStream
		Illustrate how the ACE IOStreams wrapper works.

	. IPC_SAP
		Illustrate the C++ wrappers for Sockets, TLI, UNIX and
		Win32 Named Pipes, and UNIX Stream Pipes.

	. Log_Msg
		Illustrate some of the features of the logging
		facility used in ACE to consolidate debugging and
		error report.

	. Logger
		This is a simple version of a Server Logging Daemon
		that illustrates the "bare-bones" usage of the
		Reactor.  A more sophisticated set of logging examples
		are in the $ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/{client,lib,server}
		directories.

	. Mem_Map
		Illustrate how the ACE memory-mapped file components
		work.

	. Misc
		Various miscellaneous tests that illustrate how ACE
		utility components work.

        . NT_Service
		Illustrates how to write an NT Service using the
		ACE_NT_Service class, and how to insert it and remove it
		in the SCM, start it, and stop it, and how to run as a
		service.

	. Reactor
		Contains many examples of how to utilize the ACE
		object-oriented event demultiplexer.

	. Service_Configurator
		Illustrates the use of the ACE mechanism for
		dynamically configuring communication services.

	. Shared_Malloc
		Illustrates the use of ACE wrappers for
		sophisticated use of the ACE_Malloc shared
		memory components.

	. Shared_Memory
		Illustrates the use of simple ACE wrappers for
		shared memory and memory mapped file.

	. System_V_IPC
		Illustrates how to use the ACE wrappers for System V
		IPC (i.e., semphores, shared memory, and message
		queues).

	. Threads
		Illustrates the use of ACE wrappers for threading
		and synchronization.
