This directory contains several examples that illustrate how to use
various concurrency mechanisms to schedule and handle timer-based
events.  All programs are interactive and utilize a common timer queue
test framework.  You can schedule or cancel time events and list all
the timers that are waiting to be triggered.

The tests include:

Reactor_Timer_Queue_Test:
-------------------------

This example shows how to use ACE_Reactor as the timer queue
management mechanism.

Thread_Timer_Queue_Test:
------------------------

This example shows how to use threads as the mechanism to generate
timer queue events.

Async_Timer_Queue_Test:
-----------------------

This example shows how to use singals as the mechanism to generate
timer queue events.  It doesn't work on NT because of NT's limited
signal mechanism, i.e., no support for SIGALRM.
