This example is very similar to the Explicit_Activation example except
that the POAs are deleted once the object references have been
created. After this, an adapter activator is install in the RootPOA to
reactivate the POAs on demand.

The server program is available here. Use the Generic_Servant/client
program to test this.

________________________________________

To test this example, type run_test.pl
________________________________________

Or
________________________________________

Run the server as follows:

% ./server -f output

This will produce three output files: output_1, output_2, and output_3

Run the client as follows:

% cd $TAO_ROOT/examples/POA/Generic_Servant
% ./client -f ../Adapter_Activator/output_1
% ./client -f ../Adapter_Activator/output_2
% ./client -f ../Adapter_Activator/output_3

Or
________________________________________

Run the server as follows:

% ./server -ORBobjrefstyle URL &

Run the client as follows:

% cd $TAO_ROOT/examples/POA/Generic_Servant
% ./client -k <IOR>

Comments :
=========
 - As soon as, the server prints out the IOR, cut it and use it for
running the client.
