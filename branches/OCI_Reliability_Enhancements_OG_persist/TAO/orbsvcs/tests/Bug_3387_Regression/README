Event Notification Service

This directory contains a test for this bug.

The test uses the Naming Service, a supplier, called MessengerServer
which gets it data via Messenger Client, and a consumer, called
MessengerConsumer.  The target of the test is the Notification
Service.  The bug is an edge case where the consumer has a constant
EndPoint, this can occur on embedded system or with ORBEndPoint, and
after connecting, disconnectes then, after rebooting or re-running,
comes back and tries to reconnect.  With the bug, the new consumer
receives no events.  After fixing the bug the consumer will again
receive events.

All of the special edge conditions are duplicated in the test.
