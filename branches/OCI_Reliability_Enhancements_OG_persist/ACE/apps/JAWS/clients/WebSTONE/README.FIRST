QUICK AND DIRTY README FOR WEBSTONE 2.0

For more details, consult the README* files and the doc/FAQ-webstone.html

First, run:

	./webstone -setup

	This script uses GNU autoconf, makes the binaries, and then
puts you into the vi editor with the conf/testbed file. For details on
how to edit conf/testbed, consult the FAQ.

Next, if you have a Web broswer available, and you'd like to try the GUI

	./webstone -gui

Otherwise, run the benchmark by typing

	./webstone
