Number of Paths vs Throughput of High Priority Path with period = 10ms
and Load = 30
=======================================================================

In this experiment we have 1 high priority path and several low
priority paths sending events over the Notification Service.

We increase the number of low priority paths as 1, 5, 10 and 20 and
measure the throughput.

Running the experiment:
======================

Run the "run_all.pl" script in this directory to run the test using RT-Notification.
as "run_all.pl --rt"

If you want to generate results using the CosNotification, run as
"run_all.pl --cos"

To generate the data for both cases run as "run_all.pl --all"

The RT-Notification results are generated in the Paths_X/rt_output directory.
The CosNotification results are generated in the Paths_X/cos_output directory.

e.g., Paths_5/rt_output/c_oth_1.dat would contain the statistics
recorded for consumer #1 of the set of 5 paths.


Expected Results:
================

For RT-Notification: The Throughput of the high priority task should remain at 100Hz. while
the remaining paths should share the remainder of the capacity.

For CosNotification: The throughput of *all* the paths is shared.
