{
  // = TITLE
  //     Provides the interface between one or more Consumers and the
  //     Event Server <ACE_Stream>.
  //
  // = DESCRIPTION
  //     This class normally sits on "top" of the Stream and routes
  //     messages coming from "downstream" to all the Consumers
  //     connected to it via its "read" <Task>.  Normally, the messages
  //     flow up the stream from <Supplier_Router>s.  However, if
  //     Consumers transmit data to the <Consumer_Router>, we dutifully
  //     push it out to the Suppliers via the <Supplier_Router>.
  //
  //     When used on the "reader" side of a Stream, the
  //     <Consumer_Router> simply forwards all messages up the stream.
  //     When used on the "writer" side, the <Consumer_Router> queues
  //     up outgoing messages to suppliers and sends them down to the
  //     <Supplier_Router> in a separate thread.  The reason for this
  //     is that it's really an "error" for a <Consumer_Router> to
  //     send messages to Suppliers, so we don't expect this to happen
  //     very much.  When it does we use a separate thread to avoid
  //     taxing the main thread, which processes "normal" messages.
  //
  //     All of the methods in this class except the constructor are
  //     called via base class pointers by the <ACE_Stream>.
  //     Therefore, we can put them in the protected section.
