BASICS
======

This directory contains both the client (LoggingClient.java) and the
server (SimpleLogger.java).  To compile, use GNU make with no specific
target.

To execute, use "java <classname>" where <classname> is from the
following table:

	Application		<classname>
	===========================================
	client			LoggingClient
	server			SimpleLogger

KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

Interoperability between the C++ client and the Java server
implementation is fine.  Interoperability between the C++ server and
the Java client seems to work right now.  See the CVS information on
LoggingClient.java for details.
