        * parser/parser/Parser.cpp (parse_char_reference):

          Fixed stupid thinko in conditional parsing of a hex character
          reference.

        * common/Mem_Map_Stream.cpp:

          We can use the old way of fetching on-demand and don't need to
          use a while loop.

        * common/NamespaceSupport.cpp:

          Fixed a long-standing bug with core dumping. With these changes,
          we are able to parse the XML specification itself. Is this
          called Meta or what ?

Wed Nov 20 20:44:56 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * common/Mem_Map_Stream.cpp (grow_file_and_remap):

          Fixed bug where we were trying to remap two different files at
          the same location without closing the first.

        * common/HttpCharStream.cpp (get_url):

          Don't try to parse an empty file. Removes a nasty SIGSEGV.

Wed Nov 20 01:06:26 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * common/Mem_Map_Stream.cpp:

          Minor indenting changes.

        * tests/HttpCharStream_Test.cpp:

          Modified test to show bug in ACE_File_Addr.

Tue Nov 19 20:46:35 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/SAXPrint/Print_Handler.cpp (warning):

          Missed syncing the function prototypes last time.

Tue Nov 19 20:18:09 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * parser/parser/Parser.h:
        * parser/parser/Parser.cpp (normalize_systemid):

          Fix an off-by-one error in normalization. The document's base
          URI is never empty. Now we parse relative document URI
          correctly.

          Implement the previously unimplemented parsing from a systemId.

        * common/InputSource.cpp:
        * common/InputSource.h:

          Added implementation for getSystemId().

        * examples/SAXPrint/Print_Handler.cpp:
        * examples/SAXPrint/SAXPrint_Handler.cpp:

          Synched up the printing of exception messages.

        * examples/SAXPrint/main.cpp:

          Fixed broken internal string version of a sample XML file.

        * parser/debug_validator/Debug_Validator.dsp:
        * parser/parser/Parser.dsp:

          Modified to accomodate zlib and zziplig. Will probably change
          before the merge.

        * parser/parser/Parser.cpp:

          Try to parse external DTD only if validation is required.

Mon Nov 18 22:29:39 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/Makefile:

          assigning it to the new Locator.

        * ACEXML/common/NamespaceSupport.cpp:

          Make sure that we don't have a null prefix before trying to

        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/SAXPrint_Handler.cpp:
        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/main.cpp:

          Commented out a lot of unnecessary debug statements.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.h:

          Lots of bugfixes. Finally we parse the XML version of XHTML
          specification without dumping core.

Sat Nov 16 21:18:55 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.h:

          More bugs fixed. Add support for parsing PE references within

Tue Nov 12 19:48:34 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserContext.cpp:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserContext.h:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserContext.inl:

          New files which hold the ParserContext needed to handle the
          switching of input streams on the fly.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserInternals.cpp:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserInternals.h:

          Moved some generic code from Parser.cpp to here.

        * ACEXML/apps/svcconf/Makefile:
        * ACEXML/common/Makefile:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Makefile:

          Updated dependencies.

        * ACEXML/common/Attributes_Def_Builder.h:

          No need to typedef in C++.

        * ACEXML/common/DefaultHandler.cpp:

          Minor typos.

        * ACEXML/common/Encoding.cpp:

        * ACEXML/common/Exception.cpp:

          Change the error message from ACE_DEBUG to ACE_ERROR.

        * ACEXML/common/FileCharStream.cpp: Handle BOM of UTF-8 in

          Handle copying of bytes according to sizeof (ACE_WCHAR).

        * ACEXML/common/StreamFactory.cpp: Create the appropriate stream
          given an URI. We don't try to normalize the URI here. It is done
          in the Parser.

        * ACEXML/common/Transcode.cpp:
        * ACEXML/common/Transcode.i:

          Moved some very big functions from .i to .cpp.

          Implemented support for external parameter and entity
          references. Rewrote a lot of the basic parsing functionality to
          adhere to the standard. Implment partial support for validation
          of XML files.


Fri Oct 25 15:44:04 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.i: Handle end-of-line as required by
          the spec. Specifically any sequence of 0x0D or 0x0D 0x0A should
          be normalized to a 0x0A before passing to the XML processor.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp: Remove checks for 0x0D as it is
          handled tranparently now.

Thu Oct 24 21:06:44 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/common/NamespaceSupport.cpp: Define strings normally and
          not as an array.

        * ACEXML/common/Attributes_Def_Builder.h: No need to typedef in C++.

Thu Oct 24 01:52:46 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML\parser\parser\Parser.cpp: Moved out the declaration of
          variables outside case labels. MSVC doesn't like it.

Wed Oct 23 22:24:59 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp: Fixed a stupid thinko in array
          initialization.

Wed Oct 23 17:27:14 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/common/Encoding.cpp:
        * ACEXML/common/Encoding.h:

          Use UTF-16 instead of UTF-16LE/UTF-16BE as the specification
          doesn't require mentioning the endianness of the input.

        * ACEXML/common/Transcode.h: Fixed some minor typos.

        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/namespaces.xml: New file which tests
          out the namespaces feature much better.

        * ACEXML/apps/svcconf/Makefile:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Makefile:

          Updated dependencies.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/ParserErrors.h: New file which contains the
          error codes of all the error spit out by the parser.

        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/Print_Handler.cpp:
        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/SAXPrint_Handler.cpp:

          Make sure that the characters() function describes the arguments
          as start and length instead of start and end.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.dsp: Added ParserErrors.h to the
          project file.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp:
        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.h:

          Use minor codes when reporting error in the parser. This cleans
          up a lot of repeated error messages and indenting so that we
          don't need to spill over 80 columns and have a standardized way
          of reporting errors. Rewrote parse_cdata() so that is is much
          simpler. Removed try_grow_cdata() as it is no longer needed.
          Handle the case when the parser was accepting invalid character
          references().
