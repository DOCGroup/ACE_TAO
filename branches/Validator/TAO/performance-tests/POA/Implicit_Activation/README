@page Activation Test README File

	This test measures the time required to activate (via _this)
and deactivate a large number of objects.  The measurements include
the time required to allocate a simple servant and, in the test using
a separate client/server, the time required to pass the object
reference around.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful, and prints
out the performance numbers.
