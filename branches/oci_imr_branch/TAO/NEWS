USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN TAO-1.3.6 and TAO-1.4
==================================================

IDL COMPILER:
-------------
. Fixed bug related to the order of #pragma prefix and #include
  directives

. Fixed bug in generation of copy constructor for AMH interface
  classes.

. Fixed incorrect handling of a parameter name in an AMI sendc_xxx
  operation that clashes with a C++ keyword.

. Readded the generation of _unchecked_narrow () back into the stub
  code since it is required by the latest OMG CORBA specification.

CORE ORB 
-------

. SCIOP endpoints are not created by default. They need explicit
  specification of -ORBEndpoint sciop:// at startup.

. Fixed a bug that caused the ORB to dump a core when server side
  interceptors returns an exception and if the operartion parameters
  contains a sequence an out parameter. 

. Fixed a bug that caused extraction of basic data types that are
  aliased from an Any.

. Added a couple of regerssions tests for some of AMH features.

. Lots of other bug fixes (see the bottom of this message for a
  complete list of bugzilla bugids fixed in this beta).

. Fixed a problem with dynamic loading of the ORB. This was introduced
  by "magic" static constructors in the TAO PortableServer headers
  where dynamic loading/unloading of the ORB failed.

. Added an option, -ORBDisableRTCollocation which allows users to
  disable the RT collocation technique used by TAO and fallback on the
  default collocation technique used for the vanilla ORB. 

. Prevent the TP_Reactor used within TAO from exiting when it receives
  a EINTR during select ().

ORB SERVICES
------------

. Added new security variable so that libTAO_Security could be built
  independently of libTAO_SSLIOP, and set the default to true. 

. An initial implementation of the FTCORBA spec has been added to
  TAO. This release features an intial cut of ReplicationManager,
  FaultNotifier, and a FaultDetector. Please see 

  $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/FT_App/README

  for a simple example that uses the different FTCORBA features that
  have been implemented in TAO. 

. Fixed a bug, in PG_ObjectGroupManager::remove_member () methods
  which caused the group entry to be available in the location_map
  when a member of the object group is removed.
