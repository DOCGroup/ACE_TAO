USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN ACE-5.3.6 and ACE-5.4
==================================================

ACE:
---
. Added a new makefile commandline flag, static_link, that can be
  used to force static linking when static_libs_only is turned on. It
  uses the new STATIC_LINK_FLAG variable and is currently only
  implemented for for GNU ld, i.e., it adds the "-static" option to
  LDFLAGS. It's turned off by default since using it causes the
  footprint to go up by almost 1 MB on Linux, since it links all the
  system and compiler .a files, but can be turned on if users
  want/need to use it, by enabling both static_libs_only and static_link.


. Added macros ACE_USES_GPROF which enables users to use gprof in a
  multithreaded environment with ACE libs. 

. Added a new functor template class, ACE_Malloc_Lock_Adapter_T,
  that's used by ACE_Malloc_T as a factory for the ACE_LOCK template
  parameter, and allows the use of locking strategy classes, like
  ACE_Process_Semaphore and ACE_Thread_Semaphore that don't have a
  satisfactory ctor taking a single required ACE_TCHAR* parameter, to
  be adapted to work with ACE_Malloc_T. 

. The source code examples from "The ACE Programmer's Guide" book by
  Huston, Syyid, and Johnston, are now located in
  $ACE_ROOT/examples/APG. 

. Support for GNU autoconf is now in ACE. Please see ACE-INSTALL.html
  for details. 

. Fixed problems that prevented ACE from being compiled on LynxOS
  4.0.0. 

. Fixed compilation error which prevented ACE from being compiled when
  ACE_COMPILE_TIMEPROBES was set to 1.

. Preliminary support for Tandem NSK has been added.

. Lots of bug fixes with TLI and XPG5. Please see $ACE_ROOT/ChangeLog
  for details.

. Fixed ACE_OS::event_timedwait() and ACE_OS::event_wait() so that
  they use a while loop around the ACE_OS::cond_[timed]wait() calls to
  avoid problems with spurious wakeups, etc. 

. ACE's wrapper around getipnodebyname() and getipnodebyaddr () has
  been made go through the IPv4-only case on ACE_WIN32. Since Windows
  IPv6 implementation doesn't offer support (at thistime) for
  getipnodebyname() the code has been changed to use the IPV4 part of
  the code. 

. Install with Borland C++ of ACE library fixed

ACEXML:
-------

. Fixed memory leak in ACEXML parser.

. Fixed implementations of rewind() in all the CharStreams. They were
  broken previously.

. Fixed bugs in the parser associated with incorrect handling of PE
  References for keywords.
