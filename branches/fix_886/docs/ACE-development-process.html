<h3>The ACE+TAO Development and Release Process</h3>

To improve the quality of our software and minimize development
effort, we try to follow the structured development and release
process described below.<p>

An important concept to keep in mind is <em>risk</em>.  Before you
commit <em>any</em> change to ACE+TAO, please consider the effects
that it will have.  Could it possibly cause a build failure, on any
platform?  Could it possibly cause different run-time behavior?  And
so on.  If so, it is your responsibility to adequately build and test
with the change, in order to verify that it has no unintended
effects.<p>

Please keep in mind the cost of committing a mistake.  It may take you
only a few seconds to fix, but its cost to the group may be much
larger.  With our large group, workspace updates and builds are likely
to happen at any time.  If one break, it can take hours to rebuild it.
And each developer that was waiting for a successful build would be
blocked for the duration of the broken build, the fix, and the
rebuild.<p>

<h3>The ACE+TAO Development Process</h3>

The ACE+TAO development process looks like:<p>
<ol>
  <li>Every change to ACE+TAO must have a bug report.  <em>Change</em>
    includes fixes, enhancements, updates, and so on.
  <li><a href="http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugs/index.cgi">Create a bug report</a>.
  <li>Accept the bug report if you are going to implement the change.
  <li>Implement the change in your workspace(s).
  <li>Test the change sufficiently to demonstrate that it both does
    what is intended, and doesn't break anything.  The test may be
    as simple as building and running the ACE+TAO tests on one platform.
    Or as complicated as rebuilding and test all of ACE+TAO on
    all platforms that we have.
  <li>Create an appropriate ChangeLog entry.
  <li>Commit the change using a ChangeLogTag commit message.
  <li>Respond to the requester of the change, if any.  Please do this
    <em>after</em> committing your change.
  <li>Make sure that the requester is listed in the THANKS file.
  <li>Update the bug report to indicate resolution.
  <li>Monitor the next round of build/tests for problems with your change.
  <li>Respond immediately to reports of problems with your changes.
</ol>

<H3>Bug Lifecycles</H3>
<P>

A bug should typically follow this life cycle:<p>
<center><table cellpadding=5 border=0>
<tr>
  <td>Submitter:</td>
  <td>Enters problem</td>
<tr>
  <td>Bugmaster:</td>
  <td>Assigns</td>
<tr>
  <td>Owner:</td>
  <td>Accepts</td>
<tr>
  <td>Owner:</td>
  <td>Reproduces problem - if it needs a new test, write it and
      put it in the regression tests.
      If it can't be reproduced, set to Resolved/CANT_FIND.<br>
      If it's a duplicate, set it to Resolved/DUPLICATE.
      Fix code, commit changes, set to Resolved.</td>
<tr>
  <td>Submitter:</td>
  <td>Tests it again; set to Verified (pass) or Reopened (fail)</td>
<tr>
  <td>Owner:</td>
  <td>After next release is done, re-test; sets to Closed or Reopened.</td>
</table></center>

<H3>The Role of the Build Czar</H3>
<P>

At all times, we'll have a build czar.  The role may be shared by
multiple people.  The build czar is responsible for ensuring that the
next kits are clean, <em>i.e.</em>, it builds and runs cleanly on all
platforms.  The status of all ACE+TAO builds is tracked automatically
<A HREF="http://ringil.ece.uci.edu/scoreboard/"</A>online</A>.<p>

The build czar's role is to:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Remind people to check build logs.  Developers are still
    responsible for verifying that their changes are clean.
  <li>Freeze the CVS repository when it's decided to no more
    non-critical changes will be accepted for the next kits.
    The build czar has the final say over when the freeze is
    implemented.  The tendency to implement a freeze sooner than
    later is intentional, desirable, beneficial, and the "Right Thing"[TM]
    to do.
  <li>Verifies that the final round of builds/tests are clean.
  <li>Creates the kits.
  <li>Unfreezes the CVS repository.
  <li>Sends email to appropriate news groups announcing the new kits.
  <li>Passes the mantle on to the next build czar.<p>
</ul>

If another developer interferes with the build czar's duties, the
build czar has the unilateral authority to pass the mantle to the
violator.  This is also intentional, desirable, beneficial, and the
Right Thing[TM] to do.<p>

<H3>The ACE+TAO Release Process</H3>
<P>

Minor releases of ACE+TAO occur periodically, typically twice a year.
Minor releases have two-digit numbers, <EM>e.g.</EM>, 5.1.  Major
releases are released infrequently, typically once a year.  Major
releases are 1-digit numbers, <EM>e.g.</EM>5, that include
substantially new functionality.  Both major and minor releases are
carefully tested on all platforms the ACE+TAO run on.  In particular,
we do not put out major or minor releases of ACE+TAO until all the
compilations and regression tests work successful on all the platform
we support. <P>

Between major/minor releases, we release betas periodically,
<EM>e.g.</EM>, once a month, so that ACE+TAO users can download and
test our latest work in progress.  ACE+TAO beta kits have three-digit
numbers, <EM>e.g.,</EM>5.1.1.  Betas are often not as stable as the
major or minor releases, but they often contain important fixes that
aren't in the official releases.  Although we try to ensure the
quality of betas, they may not compile cleanly on all platforms, nor
will they necessarily pass all of the tests on all platforms.  They
will, however, compile cleanly and pass most tests on most platforms.
As usual, we endeavor to fix any problems that arise as quickly as
possible.  Naturally, if you require 100% predictable stability and
support, please contact <A HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com/">OCI</A>
for TAO commercial support or <A
HREF="http://www.riverace.com/">Riverace</A> for ACE commercial
support. <P>
