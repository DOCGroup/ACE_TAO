Documentation about the Triangle test

Purpose:

Is to show how nested upcalls are handled.

Three objects exist: 
Object A, Object B and the Initiator

The initiator calls a two-way call foo on object A,
object A calls foo_object_B, a one-way call, on the initiator,
this causes initiator to call foo on object B,
this causes object B to (oneway) call finish on object A,
this causes object A to return from its first two-way call 
(before object B returns from its two-way call),
after a second or so object B returns from its two-way call.

The printed order should show, that the replies are 
handled in the stack order, but not in the actual 
arriving order.

To start:

%server_A -o server1
%
%server_B -o server2
%
%initiator -f server1 -g server2
