    </CENTER>

    <H3>Configuring the Event Channel at Compilation Time</H3>

    <P>TAO's Real-Time Event Channel can be configured at compilation
      time to use a different payload than its default.  To do so
      there are several options:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI><P>To eliminate the <CODE>CORBA::Any</CODE> field in the
          event payload you should define the
          <CODE>TAO_LACKS_EVENT_CHANNEL_ANY</CODE>
          macro when invoking the IDL compiler.
          You can do as follows:
<PRE>
$ cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
$ make TAO_IDLFLAGS=-DTAO_LACKS_EVENT_CHANNEL_ANY
</PRE>
        </P>
      </LI>
      <LI><P>Similarly you can eliminate the octet sequence field in
          the event payload using:
<PRE>
$ cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
$ make TAO_IDLFLAGS=-DTAO_LACKS_EVENT_CHANNEL_OCTET_SEQUENCE
</PRE>
        </P>
      </LI>
      <LI><P>Finally you can provide your own event payload, to do
          this you should Replace the contents of the
          <CODE>RtecDefaultEventData.idl</CODE>
          and define some IDL structure named
          <CODE>RtecEventData</CODE>.
          For example, you could define you own event type as follows:
<PRE>
// Replace RtecDefaultEventData.idl with this:

struct RtecEventData
{
  sequence&lt;long&gt; my_event_payload;
};
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <H3>Run-time Configuration</H3>

    <P>The new implementation of the real-time event channel uses a
      factory to build all the objects and strategies it requires.
      The factory can be dynamically loaded using ACE Service
      Configurator, this is extremely convenient because the factory
      can also parse options in the Service Configurator script file.
    </P>

    <P>There are currently four implementations of the factory.  The
      table below describes all of the options (and values) supported by
      these factories.  The <em>default</em> factory supports all of
      the options below and most of the potential values, except as
      specifically indicated.
      The <em>sched</em> factory defines new option values as indicated
      below that allow the RTES to integrate with the Real-Time
      Scheduling Service.  Use of the <em>sched</em> factory requires
      that you link in the TAO_RTSchedEvent library.
      The <em>basic</em> and <em>null</em> factories are hard-coded
      factories that do not support any configuration options.
      They both define simple configurations that may enable some
      applications to use the RTES in a smaller footprint.
      See the files
      <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.h</code>
      and <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.h</code>
      for details.
    </P>

    <H3>The configuration file</H3>

    <P>The real-time event channel uses the same service configurator
      file that the ORB uses, the default name for this file is
      <CODE>svc.conf</CODE>, but the ORB option
      <CODE>-ORBSvcConf</CODE> can be used to override this.
      The format of the file is described in detail in
      the service configurator documentation, but the relevant section
      for the event channel looks like this:
    </P>

<PRE>
# Comments go here...
# More comments if you want to...
static EC_Factory "-ECFiltering basic ....."
</PRE>

    <P>All the event service factory options start with
      <CODE>-EC</CODE></P>

            The <EM>priority</EM> strategy (sched factory only) uses
            a prioritized pool
            of threads and queries the scheduling service to select
            the thread that dispatches each event.
            The <EM>mt</EM> strategy also uses a pool of threads,
            but the thread to dispatch is randomly selected.

          <TD>Select the filtering strategy used by the consumers.
            The <EM>null</EM> filtering strategy will build trivial
            filters for all consumers.
            The <EM>basic</EM> filtering strategy supports
            disjunction, conjunction, logical and, negation, bitmask,
            and timeout filters based on the subscriptions passed by
            the consumer during the connect call. It only supports limited
            nesting of filter groups.
            The <EM>prefix</EM> filtering strategy supports
            all filter types that the <EM>basic</EM> strategy does
            and allows unlimited nesting of filter groups.
            When using the <EM>prefix</EM> strategy, the source field of the
            group filter must specify the number of children in the group.
            The <EM>priority</EM> filtering strategy  (sched factory only)
            supports the same
            features as the <EM>basic</EM> filtering strategy, but it
            also collaborates with the scheduling service to build the
            dependency graph.

            <EM>supplier_filtering_strategy</EM>
          </TD>
          <TD>The event channel can also perform some filtering close
            to the suppliers by minimizing the number of consumers
            that are tested for given event.
            If the strategy is <EM>null</EM> then a global collection
            of consumers is maintained and each event is filtered by
            each consumer.
            If the strategy is <EM>per-supplier</EM> then the EC uses
            the supplier publications and the consumer subscriptions
            to determine which consumers could potentially be
            interested in events for each supplier.
            This set of consumers is usually smaller than the complete
            set and it is thus faster to traverse it, but keeping more
            collections of consumers increases the connection and
            disconnection time as well as the memory requirements.

          <TD>A consumer can request that the event channel generate
            periodic or oneshot timeout events.
            This option controls the strategy to generate the
            timeouts,
            using <EM>reactive</EM> the same reactor used for the ORB
            is used by the event service.
            The <EM>priority</EM> strategy  (sched factory only) uses a
            prioritized group of
            threads, timeouts with higher rate are generated by
            threads of higher priority.

          <TD>The event channel uses the Observer pattern to report
            changes in the subscriptions and publications of its
            suppliers and consumers; this is especially useful in the

      its constructor:
    </P>

<PRE>
  TAO_EC_Event_Channel (const TAO_EC_Event_Channel_Attributes& attributes,
                        TAO_EC_Factory* factory = 0,
                        int own_factory = 0);
</PRE>

    <P>The <CODE>factory</CODE> is an optional parameter to override
      the default strategy factory used by the event channel,
      the event channel will destroy the factory if the
      <CODE>own_factory</CODE> argument is true.
    </P>

    <P>The <CODE>attributes</CODE> parameter can be used to fine tune
      some of the algorithms and strategies used by the event channel,
      the default values are probably OK for most applications.
      Notice that the attributes include the POA used to activate the
      ConsumerAdmin, SupplierAdmin, ProxyPushConsumer and
      ProxyPushSupplier objects;
      these POAs must have the <CODE>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</CODE> and the
      <CODE>SYSTEM_ID</CODE> policies (as the RootPOA does).
    </P>

        <TR><TH>Attribute</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>consumer_reconnect</CODE></TD>
          <TD>If the attribute is not zero then the same consumer can
            call <CODE>connect_push_consumer</CODE> on its
            ProxyPushSupplier multiple times to change its
            subscriptions;
            this is usually more efficient that disconnecting and
            connecting again.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>supplier_reconnect</CODE></TD>
          <TD>If the attribute is not zero then the same supplier can
            call <CODE>connect_push_supplier</CODE> on its
            ProxyPushConsumer multiple times to change its
            publications;
            this is usually more efficient that disconnecting and
            connecting again.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>busy_hwm</CODE></TD>
          <TD>When the delayed flag is set on proxy collections,
            this flag controls the maximum
            number of threads that can simultaneously iterate over the
            collection before blocking.
            It can be used to avoid starvation in delayed updates on
            the collection.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>max_write_delay</CODE></TD>
          <TD>When the delayed flag is set on proxy collections,
            this flag controls the maximum
            number of threads that will initiate dispatching
            <B>after</B> a change has been posted.
            Any thread after that is blocked until the operations are
            performed.
            It can be used to completely stop starvation of delayed
            updates on the collection.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>scheduler</CODE></TD>
          <TD>Most configurations of the real-time event channel do
            not require an scheduler.
            If any of the strategies that require an scheduling
            service is selected then this attribute should be set
            appropiately.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>supplier_poa</CODE></TD>
          <TD>The POA used by the event channel to activate SupplierAdmin
            and SupplierProxy objects.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>consumer_poa</CODE></TD>
          <TD>The POA used by the event channel to activate ConsumerAdmin
            and ConsumerProxy objects.
          </TD>
        </TR>

        <TR><TD><CODE>disconnect_callbacks</CODE></TD>
          <TD>If not zero, then the event channel sends disconnect
            callbacks when a disconnect method is called on a Proxy.
            For example, if a consumer calls
            disconnect_push_supplier() on its proxy the EC
            invokes disconnect_push_consumer() on the consumer.
            An analogous call is also made for suppliers when this
            attribute is set.
            By default, these callbacks are not made in this situation.
