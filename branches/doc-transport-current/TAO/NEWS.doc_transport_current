. (OCI) Added TransportCurrent support. This is an optional library,
  which enables functionality for client- and server-side components,
  to obtain information on the "current" Transport.  By definition
  this is the Transport selected in the context of the current
  invocation. Since specific Transport's may have very different
  characteristics, a generic implementation is not sufficient and
  support for specific Transports is also included. See the TC_IIOP
  implementation, which is an IIOP-specific Transport Current.  To
  build TAO with support for this feature, define a macro named
  TAO_HAS_TRANSPORT_CURRENT and value of 1. For more details see
  $TAO_ROOT/docs/transport_current/index.html
