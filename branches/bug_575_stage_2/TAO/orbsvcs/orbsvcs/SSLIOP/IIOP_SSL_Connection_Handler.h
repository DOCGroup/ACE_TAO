/**
 * @class TAO_IIOP_SSL_Connection_Handler
 *
 * @brief
 * IIOP connection handler designed to be "SSL aware," i.e. it is
 * aware of the existence of the SSLIOP connection handler.   It makes
 * sure that SSL session state from a previous connection is not
 * associated with the non-SSL connection handled by this handler.
 *
 * This connection handler is essentially the same as the
 * standard IIOP client connection handler it is derived from.
 * However, this class overrides the handle_input() method to
 * invalidate the current TSS SSL state during a standard IIOP
 * (insecure) upcall.  This prevents SSL session state from a previous
 * SSL connection from being associated with non-SSL connections
 * processed by this connection handler.  In particular, this is very
 * important for closing a security hole in nested upcalls.  For
 * example, an SSLIOP request is made.  During that secure upcall, an
 * insecure nested upcall is made.  A naive implementation would
 * associate the TSS SSL state from the secure upcall with the
 * insecure upcall.  This implementation closes that security hole.

 * This class sets up null TSS SSL state upon instantiation, and
 * restores the previous TSS SSL state when that instance goes out of
 * scope.
 *
 * This guard is used to make TSS SSL state configuration and
 * deconfiguration during an upcall exception safe.  Exceptions are
 * not supposed to be propagated up to the scope this guard is used
 * in, so this guard may be unnecessary.  However, since proper TSS
 * SSL state configuration/deconfiguration is critical to proper
 * security support, this guard is used to ensure that
 * configuration/deconfiguration is exception safe.
