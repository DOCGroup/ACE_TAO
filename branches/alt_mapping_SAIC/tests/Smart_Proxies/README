Smart Proxies Overview
----------------------

Smart Proxies are a TAO extension that helps applications create
user-defined proxies that can be used to add custom client-side
processing and security to the default stub proxy.

For details on how TAO implements Smart Proxies please see:

www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/docs/Smart_Proxies.html

Smart Proxy Example
-------------------

This directory contains a simple example that demonstrates how the TAO
Smart Proxy feature can be used.  In this example, just a single
method has been "smartified" to illustrate how you just implement the
methods you wish to customize since the rest will be taken care of the
generated Smart Proxy base class.

All you need to define in the client application is a new factory that
will produce the kind of proxy desired by the user.  This factory must
be provided by the user and must derive from the generated
TAO_Default_Proxy_Factory class.

For execution of the test:

1) ./server -o test.ior

2) ./client

or simply use:

run_test.pl

Happy troubleshooting!
