 *
 * Based on previous work by Tim Harrison (harrison@cs.wustl.edu) and
 * other members of the DOC group. More details can be found in:
 *
 * http://doc.ece.uci.edu/~coryan/EC/index.html
 *
 * Define helper classes to propagate events between ECs using
 * either UDP or multicast.
 * The architecture is a bit complicated and deserves some
 * explanation: sending the events over UDP (or mcast) is easy, a
 * Consumer (TAO_ECG_UDP_Sender) subscribes for a certain set of
 * events, its push() method marshalls the event set into a CDR
 * stream that is sent using an ACE_SOCK_Dgram. The subscription
 * set and IP address can be configured.
 * Another helper class (TAO_ECG_UDP_Receiver) acts as a supplier of
 * events; it receives a callback when an event is available on an
 * ACE_SOCK_Dgram, it demarshalls the event and pushes it to the
 * EC.  Two ACE_Event_Handler classes are provided that can forward
 * the events to this Supplier: TAO_ECG_Mcast_EH can receive events
 * from a multicast group; TAO_ECG_UDP_EH can receive events from a
 * regular UDP socket.
 *
 * @todo The class makes an extra copy of the events, we need to
 * investigate if closer collaboration with its collocated EC could
 * be used to remove that copy.
