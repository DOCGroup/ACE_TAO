Priority Preservation test on multiple hosts.

There are 4 hosts involved in this test.

Host 1 : Start the run_notify.pl here. It starts up an instance of the
RT Notification configured with 3 lanes - High, Medium and Low
priority.

Host 2: Start path_low_prio.pl here. This will start a
consumer-supplier pair which is configured for a low priority event
propagation path. 

Host 3: Start path_medium_prio.pl here. This will start a
consumer-supplier pair which is configured for a medium priority event
propagation path. 

Host 4: Start path_high_prio.pl here. This will start a
consumer-supplier pair which is configured for a high priority event
propagation path. 

Once the path_high_prio.pl is started, it will signal the low path and
medium priority path tests to execute.

Each test will generate the data files from the results recorded
during execution.
