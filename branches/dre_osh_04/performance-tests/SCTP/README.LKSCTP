This README describes the LKSCTP implementation of SCTP for Linux.

June 2003 - 1.0

Overview
--------

The LKSCTP project is the Linux Kernel implementation of SCTP.  As of this 
writing it has been incorporated into the Linux 2.5 development series of
kernels.   

LKSCTP adheres to the IETF's SCTP Sockets Draft API.  Please refer to that 
document for API specifics.  

Building ACE with LKSCTP support
--------------------------------

        - compile kernel with SCTP support
                + if compiled as a module, be sure to load it.  

        - download LKSCTP userspace functions library from 
          http://lksctp.sourceforge.net/

        - install userspace library (libsctp.a) into /usr/local/lib

        - install header file (sctp.h) into /usr/local/include/sctp.h

        - make ACE with "sctp=lksctp"

Caveats
---------------------------------

        - Both services interfaces (SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET) will
          preserve message boundaries.
