   * Constructor initializes the command line to be parsed. All information
   * for parsing must be supplied to this constructor.
   *
   * @param argc          The number of @a argv elements to parse.
   * @param argv          Command line tokens, such as would be passed
   *                      to @c main().
   * @param optstring     Nul-terminated string containing the legitimate
   *                      short option characters.  A single colon ":" in
   *                      @a optstring means that the previous character is
   *                      an option that requires an argument.  A double
   *                      colon "::" signifies the argument is optional.
   *                      The argument is taken from the rest of the current
   *                      @a argv element, or from the following @a argv
   *                      element (only valid for required arguments;
   *                      optional arguments must always reside in the same
   *                      @argv element). The argument value, if any is
   *                      returned by the @c opt_arg() method.
   *                      @a optstring can be extended by adding long options
   *                      with corresponding short options via the
   *                      @c long_option() method.  If the short option
   *                      already appears in @a optstring, the argument
   *                      characteristics must match, otherwise it is added.
   *                      See @c long_option() for more information.
   *                      If 'W', followed by a semi-colon ';' appears in
   *                      @a optstring, then any time a 'W' appears on the
   *                      command line, the following argument is treated as
   *                      a long option.  For example, if the command line
   *                      contains "program -W foo", "foo" is treated as a
   *                      long option, that is, as if "program --foo" had
   *                      been passed.
   *
   * @param skip_argv0    Optional (default 1). The specified number of
   *                      initial elements in @a argv are skipped before
   *                      parsing begins. Thus, the default prevents
   *                      @a argv[0] (usually the command name) from being
   *                      parsed. This value of @a argc includes all skipped
   *                      elements of @a argv specified by this parameter.
   * @param report_errors Optional, if non-zero then parsing errors cause
   *                      an error message to be displayed from the
   *                      @c operator() method before it returns. The
   *                      error message is suppressed if this argument is 0.
   * @param ordering      Optional (default is @c PERMUTE_ARGS); refers to
   *                      how the @a argv elements are processed.
   *                      @arg REQUIRE_ORDER means that processing stops and
   *                      @c EOF is returned as soon as a non-option argument
   *                      is found. @c opt_ind() will return the index of the
   *                      next @a argv element so the program can continue
   *                      processing the rest of the @a argv elements.
   *                      @arg PERMUTE_ARGS (default) means the @a argv
   *                      elements are reordered dynamically (permuted) so
   *                      that all options appear first.  When the last
   *                      option has been processed, @c EOF is returned and
   *                      @c opt_ind() returns the index into the next
   *                      non-option element.
   *                      @arg RETURN_IN_ORDER means each @a argv element
   *                      is processed in the order is it seen.  If the
   *                      element is not recognized as an option, '1' is
   *                      returned and @c opt_arg() refers to the @a argv
   *                      element found.
   * @param long_only     Optional. If non-zero, then all options are treated
   *                      as long options.  If a long option is not
   *                      recognized, the class tries to find a matching
   *                      short option.
   *
   * Multiple short options can be combined as long as only the last
   * one can takes an argument. For example, if @a optstring is defined as
   * @c "abc:" or @c "abc::" then the command line @e "program -abcxxx" short
   * options @e a, @e b, and @e c are found with @e "xxx" as the argument for
   * @e c.
   * However, if the command line is specified as @e "program -acb" only
   * options @e a and @e c are found with @e "b" as the argument for @e c.
   * Also, for options with optional arguments, that is, those followed by
   * "::", the argument must be in the same @a argv element, so "program -abc
   * xxx" will only find "xxx" as the argument for @e c if @a optstring is
   * specified as @c "abc:" not @c "abc::".
