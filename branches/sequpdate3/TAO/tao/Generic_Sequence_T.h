 * @brief Implement the generic version of CORBA sequences.
 *
 * All CORBA sequences are based on this class template.  The behavior
 * of this class is controlled by two sets of traits.  First, the
 * ALLOCATION_TRAITS control how buffers are allocated and
 * initialized.  Since this is where most of the variation between
 * unbounded and bounded sequences is found, the ALLOCATION_TRAITS can
 * be thought as the bounded aspect of the sequence.
 *
 * Second, the element traits control how are elements copied,
 * initialized and released.  Value-like types, such as integers and
 * structures, have trivial initialization and release requirements
 * (their constructor/destructors do the job!)   But reference-like
 * types, such as strings and object references, have more complicated
 * requirements.  This is yet another aspect of the sequences, we can
 * call it the "element copy semantics" or something.
 *
 * Oh, and let us not forget the type that the sequences encapsulates.
 *
 * The intent is not for sequences to simply derive or instantiate this
 * type.  Instead, different each sequence type is written using
 * composition.  They instantiate a generic sequence with the correct
 * traits, and implement the adapt the generic sequence interface to
 * whatever requirements the spec may impose.  For example, replace()
 * has different number of arguments in bounded vs. unbounded
 * sequences, and operator[] returns different types depending on the
 * underlying type of the sequence.
 *
 * This class offers the strong exception-safety guarantee, as long as
 * destructors and release operations do not throw.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe.  Thread-safe collections are mostly
 * useless anyways.
 *
 * In general the performance characteristics of the class depends on
 * the traits.  Obviously, they can only be expressed on the number of
 * element constructor and destructor calls.  If the constructor takes
 * O(K) time that is not the sequence fault!
 *
 * All accessors are O(1), single-element modifiers are O(1), multiple
 * element modifiers are O(n + m) where n is the number of elements
 * originally in the sequence, and m is the number of elements left in
 * the sequence afterwards.
 *
 * Beware:
 * - get_buffer(true) may modify multiple elements
 * - length(CORBA::ULong) may modify multiple elements!
