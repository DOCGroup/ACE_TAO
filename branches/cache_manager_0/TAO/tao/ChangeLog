	* tao/Cache_Entries.cpp: Did a cosmetic fix.

	* tao/Cache_Entries.h:
	* tao/Cache_Entries.inl: Added a new method incr_index () to the
	  TAO_CacheExtId class. 

	* tao/Resource_Factory.cpp: 
	* tao/Resource_Factory.h:Added two new methods,
	  max_muxed_connections () and locked_transport_cache (). The
	  former returns the number of user specified muxed connections
	  with a particular property. The latter returns a boolean value
	  to indicate whether the transport cache needs to have a lock or
	  not . 

	* tao/default_resource.cpp:
	* tao/default_resource.h: Concrete implementations for the methods
	  declared in Resource_Factory.
	
	* tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.cpp:
	* tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.h:
	* tao/Transport_Cache_Manager.inl: Added support for counted muxed
	  connections ie. the user can limit the number of remote
	  connections (with a particular property). If the thread
	  searching the cache for a free connection doesnt find one that
	  is free, the thread will wait on a condition variable for the
	  connection to be released. To accomodate this the following set
	  of changes were made
	  
	  - Added a condition variable to the class
	  
	  - Create the type of lock that needs to be used for the cache
	    locally and use that lock to create the condition variable. If
	    the cache is free of any locks we dont create a condition
	    variable. 
	  
	  - The creation of lock has been moved to the
	    Transport_Cache_Manager from the Resource_Factory. 

	  - Added two new methods, wait_for_connection () and
	    is_wakeup_useful (). The wait_for_connection () blocks the
	    thread searching for connection, if there is a limit on the
	    number of muxed connections and if there have been enough
	    connections created with the same property. The
	    is_wakeup_useful () method is called by an unblocked thread to
	    check whether the transport that was returned is the one the
	    thread was waiting for. 

	  - Removed a version of rebind () and a couple of version of
	    unbind () calls as they were not used.


	* tao/Condition.h:
	* tao/Condition.cpp:.
	* tao/Condition.inl: A simple wrapper that wraps a
	  TAO_SYNCH_CONDITION that can be used with different types of
	  Mutex classes.
