Description:

This is a simple test for buffered oneways.  It invokes multiple
oneway calls.  Due to buffering in the ORB, the calls are
automatically bunched together instead of being delivered to the
server upon every invocation.

Expected output:

The client invokes a oneway after <interval> amount of time.  Flushing
occurs every <flush count> invocations (explicitly), or after <message
count> invocations (implicitly), or after <message bytes> have been
queued up (implicitly).  Any of these options can be turned off by
setting them to -1.

The server prints out the time and the number of the oneway request.
The output should show a batch of invocations received on the server.

How to run:

You can use the run_test.pl script to run it or:

$ server
$ client
