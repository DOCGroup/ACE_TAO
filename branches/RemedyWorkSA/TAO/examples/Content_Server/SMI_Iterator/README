This program illustrates how to implement a simple client and server
using CORBA, IIOP, and synchronous method invocations (SMI).  Client
applications can use this service to download and display files from a
CORBA server on the network.  The core functionality of this program
is as follows:

        * Client applications will use an iterator to download and display
          files from a CORBA server one ``chunk'' at a time, rather
          than in one large chunk. This design will help improve the
          memory management overhead on the client and server.

        * Operations in the IDL interface will use exceptions to propagate
          problems back to clients.

        * The CORBA Naming Service is used to bind and resolve object
          references, rather than using a file.

The client program performs the following activities:

        1. From the command-line, it reads the name of the pathname
           you want to download.  It then initializes the client-side
           ORB and uses resolve_initial_references() to obtain a
           reference to a Naming Service (which must be running). This
           object reference is then downcast via _narrow() to an
           object reference for a CosNaming::NamingContext interface,
           which is then used to resolve the object reference that the
           server bound earlier.  After narrowing this to the Server
           interface, the get_iterator() operation is called via the
           object reference to obtain the Chunk_Iterator, which is
           used to download the file.

        2. When next_chunk() returns a chunk of the file, the contents
           are written into a temporary file created in your a cache
           (e.g., /tmp/yourloginname) on the local host.  Then, an
           external viewer is spawned to display the file.  The type
           of viewer to spawn is determined by examining the the
           content_type_ metadata returned by the server.

The example can be run as follows:

	1. Start the Name Service:

		$ NameService -o /tmp/ns.ior

	2. Start the SMI Content Server:

		$ server -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior

	3. Request a file using the client:

		$ client -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior \
		~/foo.jpg

This particular example can only service one file at a time.


Server output should look like the following:

$ ./server -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior
Bound <Iterator_Factory> to <IOR:010000002400000049444c3a57653625f5365727665722f4974657261746f725f466163746f72793a312e300001000000000000007c000000010102001400000076616c696e6f12722e6563652e7563692e65647500f39600001b00000014010f00525354bd9d4e39a6ac03000000000001000000010000000003000000000000000800000001000000004f4154010000001400000001ad85e4001000100000000000901010000000000004f41540400000001ac0000> in Name Service.

Client output should look similar to:

$ ./client -ORBInitRef NameService=file:///tmp/ns.ior ~/foo.jpg
File </home/my_home/foo.jpg> has the following characteristics:
