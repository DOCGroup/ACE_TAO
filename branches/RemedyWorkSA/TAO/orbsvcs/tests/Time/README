=================== Time Service Test =====================================

A sample run of the TimeService can be done as follows :

* Using the Naming Service :

1. Run TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service/server on different machines.
2. Run TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service/clerk -t 5 on some machines.
3. Run the TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Time/client on one of the machines where a clerk
   is running.

* Using Files :

1. Run TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service/server -o server_ior on different machines.
2. Run TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service/clerk -t 5 -f server_ior -o clerk_ior on some
   machines.
3. Run the TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Time/client -f clerk_ior on one of the machines
   where a clerk is running.

* Using the Implementation Repository :

1. Run the Implementation Repository service as :

   TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service> ../ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_Service -ORBsvcconf
                             implrepo.conf -ORBobjrefstyle url -d 1

2. Run the Server as

   TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service> server -o server_ior -r -i

3. Run the Clerk as

   TAO/orbsvcs/Time_Service> clerk -f server_ior -t 5 -o clerk_ior

4. Run the client as

   TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Time/client -f clerk_ior

Algorithms
----------

Currently, updating the system time involves taking the average of all
the times received from the servers. This can be extended by using a
more elaborate distributed time synchronization algorithm.
