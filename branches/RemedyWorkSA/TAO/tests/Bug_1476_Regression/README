        This is a test for bug 1476.

        When making oneway invocations with sync_none policy applied
        the orb shouldn't block when making the connection but queue
        the message on the transport and send it when the transport
        is connected. In case later the connection establishment fails
        the message are just dropped, sync_none just doesn't give any
        guarantee, so if you don't like this behaviour, don't use it.

        For this test the connection between client and server shouldn't
        be established directly, but take some time, this is hard to
        get working on localhost or the same lan, use a server on a remote
        site to test this. Because of this we don't run this test in
        our daily builds

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
