@page Bug_1476_Test Test README File

	This test is built on the Hello test. The client pings
the server with either the SYNC_NONE or SYNC_DELAYED_BUFFERING
applied at the object, orb or thread level. The run_test iterates
through all the possible permutations.

In each scenario the client should initiate a non-blocking connection.
Since there is no listening server a blocking connection attempt will
result in an exception and hense test failure.

NOTES:
1. Make sure the client always uses a named ORB. In the past
inconsistencies have been discovered when using the default
orb.
2. Make sure the interface names of the two tests always match.
The signature can change, but the name 'Hello' needs to match as
its embedded in the IOR.
3. The IOR should always point locally else the test will take a
long time to fail.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
