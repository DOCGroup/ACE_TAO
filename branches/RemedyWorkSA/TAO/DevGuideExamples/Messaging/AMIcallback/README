File: DevGuideExamples/Messaging/AMIcallback/README


This directory contains an example illustrating the Asynchronous
Method Invocation (AMI) feature of TAO.  This feature permits
requests to be made that do not require a client to block while
waiting for a reply from a server.

This example is based on the Messenger example in GettingStarted
directory.  A message is send by MessengerClient and displayed by
MessengerServer.  The server responds to provide confirmation
that the message was received.  The delay for this exchange of
messages is then displayed.
