      The most basic of the Boeing scenarios that form part of the
OEP. This is done to illustrate how the OEP can be implemented using
CIAO.

        Compilation of the CIDL compiler source code requires the
Boost library, which is not included in this distribution of
ACE+TAO+CIAO. The Boost library is available at

http://www.boost.org

        Alternatively, a binary executable of the CIAO
CIDL compiler can be downloaded from

http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO/CIDL.html

Versions are available at the above site for Linux and Windows.
