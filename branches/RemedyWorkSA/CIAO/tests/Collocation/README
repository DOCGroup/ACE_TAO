This test is used to test collocation.

CIAO has to be build with ccm_direct_collocation=1

In order to make sure that indeed direct collocation is used, the test self
is build with -Sp (see Base.mpc),so collocation thru_poa is disabled.

The test runs with different CollocationStrategies, defined in the deploymentplans:
- PlanAllOnOneNoTP ( Sender and Receiver same process) with  -ORBCollocationStrategy thru_poa:
    because thru_poa is disabled, we expect an internal exception. 
- PlanAllOnOne ( Sender and Receiver same process) with  -ORBCollocationStrategy direct:
  we expect collocation and because thru_poa is disabled, this must be direct collocation.
- PlanAllOnOneBest ( Sender and Receiver same process) with  -ORBCollocationStrategy best:
  we expect collocation and because thru_poa is disabled, this must be direct collocation.
- PlanAllOnOneNo ( Sender and Receiver same process) with  -ORBCollocation no:
  we expect no collocation.

- PlanAllOnOneMore ( Sender and Receiver different process)  with  -ORBCollocationStrategy direct:
 we expect no collocation, but a remote strategy because the Sender and Receiver are not in the same process.
