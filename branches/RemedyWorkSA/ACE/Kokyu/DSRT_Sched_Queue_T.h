   * @class Sched_Ready_Queue
   *
   * @brief RB_Tree based template class for implementation of
   * reordering queue.
   *
   * This queue is used as a priority queue to store schedulable
   * entities. The item at the top of the RB_Tree is the most eligible
   * item. The comparator used to determine the most eligible item is
   * passed as a template parameter <code> More_Eligible_Comparator
   * </code>. This is expected to be a functor which compares two
   * schedulable items. The mutex type template parameter for RB_Tree
   * is chosen to be a null mutex since all the methods in the
   * enclosing <code> Sched_Ready_Queue </code> class are thread
   * safe. Since QoS is used for comparison between two schedulable
   * items, QoSDescriptor is the ideal candidate to be used as the key
   * or the EXT_ID for RB_Tree instantiation. But two qos descriptors
   * could be the same. The existing implementation of RB_Tree does
   * not allow duplicate keys. In order to facilitate insertion of
   * duplicate qos descriptors, the qos descriptors are contained in a
   * <code> DSRT_Dispatch_Item </code> and this is used as the basis
   * of comparison. To resolve tie between equal qos values, an
   * insertion time stamp is maintained in each item and an item with
   * an earlier time stamp is more eligible than an item with an
   * identical qos value. Another requirement is that it should be
   * possible to remove an item from the RB_Tree based on guid. Since
   * we have already used up the qos descriptor for the key, we need a
   * separate index into the list of schedulable items. The second
   * index should be based on guid. This is achieved by using a hash
   * map to store <guid, RB_Tree_Node*> pairs. This makes the deletion
   * of nodes from RB_Tree more efficient.
