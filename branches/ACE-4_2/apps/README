The subdirectories in this directory provide a number of complete
applications that utilize the ACE features.

	. Gateway -- Implements a connection-oriented application-level
	  gateway that uses source-based and destination-based routing
	  of messages between peers connected via TCP/IP networks.
	
	. JAWS -- This is a high-performance HTTP Web server written
	  with ACE.  It illustrates a number of sophisticated ACE
	  concurrency and event demultiplexing strategies.

	. Orbix-Examples -- Implements several applications that
	  integrate ACE and Orbix (which is IONA's implementation of
	  CORBA).  By default, these aren't compiled since most
	  platforms don't have Orbix.

	. gperf -- The GNU perfect hash function generator.
