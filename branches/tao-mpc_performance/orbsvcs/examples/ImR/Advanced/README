This example tests several uses of the Implementation Repository.

How to Run
----------

Create driver files:
------------------------------------------------------
Driver files are stored in the drivers directory.
Each file contains a set of parameters for each execution of the
test.

Each line item in the file has one of the follow forms.
Empty lines are ignored.

    # <Comment>
    begin
    <param>=<value>
    do <command>
    - <Disabled Line>
    -- (Begin/End Disabled Block)

* Comment lines are printed to standard-out.
* 'begin' resets all parameters to default and clears temporary files.
* Parameter assignments override the default values.
* 'do' executes the specified command
    - There are three predefined use-case commands
        * use_invocation
        * use_persistence
        * use_environment
    - All methods in run-test can be executed with the do command
* Disabled lines are ignored
* The -- designates the begin and end of a block of lines to ignore

Execute the example script
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The run_test.pl script reads the driver file and executes each line.
Simply execute run_test.pl to run all test in the drivers directory.
