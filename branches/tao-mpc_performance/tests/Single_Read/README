This is a stress test for TAO's "single read" feature. This test sends
different sized octet sequences as one-way calls to the server. The
server should not lose any of the calls. The client and server can be
started like this

$ server -o filename
$ client -k file://filename -d <data_bytes> -i <iterations>

The client first sends an octet sequnce of size data_bytes, then
follows that with octet sequence of size 10 times more and follows
that with an octet sequnce of size 10 times less than <data_bytes>
size. This sequence of data pushing is done <iterations>
times. Preferably <data_bytes> should be a multiple of 10 with a
minimum value of 10.

TO_DO
----
Make this test a multi-threaded one.
