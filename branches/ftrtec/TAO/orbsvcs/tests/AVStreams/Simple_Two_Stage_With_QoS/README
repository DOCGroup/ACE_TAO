Description
-----------

This directory contains a simple test in the form of a sender and a
receiver.  The test has the following features:

1. It tests the AVStreams Integration with the AQoSA API. The test 
initiates an RSVP session between the sender and receiver.
2. Shows a mechanism to pace data.

Running the test
----------------

First start the RSVP daemon(s)

receiver
--------

receiver -f <output_filename>

-f <output_filename> -> The name of the file under which the received stream
                        data has to be stored (defaults to "output")

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-p <protocol>] [-r <frame rate>] [-l <local_address>] [-a <peer_address>] [-d]  


-f filename --> The file to be streamed to the receiver (defaults to
                "input"). 

-p protocol --> The protocol string could be UDP or TCP (defaults to
                UDP). But with the multicast address it should be UDP.

-r framerate--> The rate at which tha data frames need to be sent
                (defaults to 30 frames per second).

-l address  --> Local address in the format host:port.

-a address  --> Destination address in the format host:port.

-d          --> Increament the TAO_debug_level for debug messages.


The test must be run with the naming service.  Check the run_test.pl
to see how to configure the test case.
