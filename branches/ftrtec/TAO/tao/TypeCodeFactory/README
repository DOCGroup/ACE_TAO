TypeCodeFactory -------

This library is used by the Interface Repository and
by CORBA::ORB to create typecodes. To minimize 
dependencies and footprint, this library need not be
built or linked by an application. However, if an
application needs to call CORBA::ORB::create_*_tc(),
then it should #include the library's header file
TypeCodeFactory_Adapter_Impl.h and link the library.
This will automatically load the library, assuming
it has been compiled. If an application is using the
Interface Repository, nothing special need be done -
the IFR will link the TypeCodeFactory library in its
own build.

Since the TypeCodeFactory must deal with Interface
Repository data types, it depends on the 
TAO_IFR_Client library.

Support has now been added for valuetypes, components,
homes, eventtypes and recursive types. For an example 
of how to create a typecode for a recursive type, see
the OMG CORBA specification section on typecode creation
(in version 3.0, section 4.11.3).
