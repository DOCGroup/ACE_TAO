# This is the list of run_test.pl's that need to be run by
# auto_run_tests.pl.
# Each line has its own test, and a test can be followed by a
# list of configurations it does _not_ run on.
#
# Example: TAO\examples\foo\run_test.pl: !MINIMUM !ST
#
# NOTE: This file contains tests only for ACE. Please do not include
# tests in TAO here..
