    You can use the ACE_Malloc template to create memory pools

    Instead, I want to get to the roots of it all and directly
    use ACE_Shared_Memory_SV.  Like many ACE objects, this is a
    wrapper around OS services.

    With this constructor we create a shared memory area to
    use.  The ACE_CREATE flag will cause it to be created if it
    doesn't already exist.  The SHM_KEY value (from shmem.h)
    uniquely identifies the segment and allows other apps to
    attach to the same segment. Execute 'ipcs -m' before and
    after starting this app to see that the segment is created.
    (I can't for the life of me correlate the SHM_KEY value back
    to the key/id reported by ipcs though.)
