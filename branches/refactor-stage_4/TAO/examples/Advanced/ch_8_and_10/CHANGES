Changelog for chapter 8 and 10  example in "Advanced CORBA 
Programming with C++" by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski, 
Copyright 1999, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA.  The following 
changes have been made to the book's source code to make the 
example work with TAO and with various platforms and compilers.

_______________________________________________________________________________
ESSENTIAL CHANGES:
  1. Changed filenames from .cc to .cpp and .hh to.h, 
     and modified #includes appropriatly

  2. a) Unnecessary standard includes of <iostreams.h> and <assert.h> must 
        be removed or moved to follow the local includes in
        server.h, server.cpp, client.cpp, and icp.cpp.
     
     b) The following files may need their includes further rearranged 
        to avoid warnings and errors (g++). The following orderings 
        seem to work fine: 
            -server.cpp:  "server.h", <algorithm>, "icp.h"
            -server.h:  "CCSS.h", <map>

  3. removed if 0 code surrounding
     operator<<(ostream & os, const CCS::Controller::EChange & ec)
     definition in server.cpp and client.cpp.

_______________________________________________________________________________
ADDITIONAL CHANGES:
  4. Added .in() to _var parameters wherever needed:
       -client.cpp: 
          -4 changes in operator<<(ostream & os, CCS::Thermometer_ptr t)
          -6 changes in main():  5 calls to is_nil(), 1 call to _narrow
          -2 additions in main() of .inout() to _var parameters of set_temp(). 
             Note: .inout() is functionally the same as .in() in this case
       
       -server.cpp: 
          3 changes in main()
          
_______________________________________________________________________________
TO DO:
   -discrepancy in temperatures in my output vs. sample output
    in book.
