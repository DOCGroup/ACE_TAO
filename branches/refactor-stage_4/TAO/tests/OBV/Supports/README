The Supports_Test example tests the ability of valuetypes to support concrete interfaces. Valuetypes are manipulated both as normal valuetypes and as object references.

The steps are as follows:

1. Activate a POA in which the valuetype will reside and create the valuetype.
2. Call the valuetype's "_this ()" method, which is inherited from the skeleton class of the supported interface. This will return an active object reference to an object that is the type of the supported interface.
3. This object reference can be passed as a parameter and supports remote operation invokations.
