/**

@page Sequence Unit Tests

Implement unit tests for the TAO CORBA sequence implementation.

The correctness of CORBA sequences is a fundamental building block for
many TAO applications, however, these classes are very complex
specially when their underlying type is not self-managed, such as
strings and object references.  This directory contains unit tests for
all these classes, i.e. tests that do not require external components
(or processes!)

Some of the tests depend on the boost::unit_test_framework
(www.boost.org)  Any other "tests" simply verify that the code
compiles.  Therefore you should install boost and configure this
feature in your build if any reasonable coverage is desired.

To run the tests use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl
