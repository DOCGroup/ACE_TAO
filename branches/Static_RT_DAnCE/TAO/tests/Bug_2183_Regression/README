This test is that old chestnut the Hello World example with a slight twist.

The RW policy is set then hang_client.pl sends an incomplete message and then the standard hello client is used
to check if the server is still blocked.

If the server is not blocked then the expected result is like:

(3496|804) - string returned <Hello there!>
Test succeeded !!!
INFO: E:\doc_cvs\ACE_wrappers\TAO\tests\Bug_2183_Regression\server being killed.
INFO: C:\Perl\bin\perl being killed.

... a regression would look like:

ERROR: E:\doc_cvs\ACE_wrappers\TAO\tests\Bug_2183_Regression\client timedout
ERROR: Bug #2183 Regression failed. Non zero result from client.
