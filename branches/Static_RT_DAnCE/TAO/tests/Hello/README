@page Hello Test README File

	The simplest possible test for TAO.  This is a very simple
test for TAO, it can be argued that it is in fact too simple to do
anything useful, i.e. chances are that this test will always pass.

	The goals of writing this test are:

- Provide a very simple, very fast 'smoke test' for ORB developers.
  If Hello does not pass then something is extremely broken and you
  should go back to the drawing board.
- Provide a code base to write more complex tests
- Rule out basic infrastructure problems: if this test does not work
  for a user then the infrastructure (network, DNS, host
  configuration) are more likely to be at fault than the ORB.
- External users are often asked to send us a 'simple test' for their
  use case, we can now point them to this test to explain what do we
  mean by "simple".
- The -GA option has been added to the IDL compiler command line.
  This option generates type code and Any insertion/extraction
  operator implementations in a separate file with the extension *A.cpp.
  This file is not included in the compilation however, to make sure
  there is no dependency on it if the client and server do not use
  type codes or Anys.

	Please refrain from "improving", extending or expanding this
test, if you need to change 

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
