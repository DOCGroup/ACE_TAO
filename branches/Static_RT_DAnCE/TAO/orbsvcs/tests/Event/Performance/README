	Performance tests for the real-time event channel.

This directory contains several tests to measure the performance of
the real-time event channel.  Remember to compile ACE and TAO with
optimizations enabled when running this tests.

	Here are some canonical test configurations:

# Measure throughput and latency, in a configuration suitable for
# single threaded systems.  This is probably the best case scenario,
# one supplier, one consumer and no locking.

$ Throughput -burstsize 100000 -burstcount 1

# Same test as above, but with a configuration that is MT-safe

$ Throughput -ORBsvcconf ec.st.conf -burstsize 100000 -burstcount 1

# Increase the number of consumers, but only the first one receives
# events.

$ Throughput -ORBsvcconf ec.st.conf -burstsize 100000 -burstcount 1 \
  -consumers 4

# Now increase the number of suppliers, only one consumer receives
# events from each supplier.

$ Throughput -ORBsvcconf ec.st.conf -burstsize 100000 -burstcount 1 \
  -consumers 4 -suppliers 4

# Now a test where all consumers receive events from all suppliers

$ Throughput -ORBsvcconf ec.st.conf -burstsize 100000 -burstcount 1 \
  -consumers 4 -suppliers 4 -consumers_tshift 0 -suppliers_tshift 0


# Measure the time required to connect the 100 consumers and 100
# suppliers, inserting one supplier first and then one supplier.
# Try -connection_order "consumers" or "suppliers"

$ Connect -ORBsvcconf ec.st.conf -consumers 100 -suppliers 100 \
  -connection_order interleaved


NOTES

	Don't worry about the "incomplete data" warning, it is a
deffect in the test.
