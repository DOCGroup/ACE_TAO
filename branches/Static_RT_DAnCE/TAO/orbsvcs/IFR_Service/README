Interface Repository -------

Required libraries (in addition to ACE and TAO):
        ACE_ROOT/TAO/tao/IFR_CLient/TAO_IFR_CLient.(lib-ext)     
        ACE_ROOT/TAO/tao/TypeCodeFactory/TAO_TypeCodeFactory.(lib-ext)       
        ACE_ROOT/TAO/tao/PortableServer/TAO_PortableServer.(lib-ext)    
        ACE_ROOT/TAO/tao/IORTable/TAO_IORTable.(lib-ext)    
        ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/TAO_Svc_Utils.(lib-ext)    

Executable name is IFR_Service.

Command line options are:

 -p		Makes the Interface Repository persistent.

 -b <filename>	Overrides the default filename used for 
		persistent storage. The default filename
		is "ifr_default_backing_store".

 -m		Enables read/write locking of IFR calls.
		If the IFR is started up with
		multithreading enabled - for example if
		a service config file is used that specifies
		thread-per-connection - this option should be
		used. Note that if ACE_HAS_THREADS is not
		defined, this option will be ignored.

 -r		Uses win32 registry for the database. Not
		available with persistence. If -p is on
		the command line, this option is ignored.
		If the platform is not win32, an error
		message is output.

 -o <filename>	Overrides the default filename used for 
		outputting the Interface Repository IOR. 
		The default filename is "if_repo.ior".

Test code for the Interface Repository can be found in
ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo.



tao_ifr ------

This is the executable that administers the IFR. Calling
tao_ifr <IDL filename> will add the contents of the IDL
file to the repository. Calling tao_ifr -r <IDL filename>
will remove the contents of the IDL file from the repository.
tao_ifr requires all the libraries that are required by
the IFR service, plus the IFR_Service executable itself.
Test code for tao_ifr can be found in
ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo/Application_Test.

tao_ifr can also handle the -ORBxxx parameters. The one most 
frequently used would probably be 

'-ORBInitRef InterfaceRepository=file://<filename>'

which will enable the IFR service to be resolved by getting 
its IOR from <filename>. By default, the IFR service stores
its IOR in the file 'if_repo.ior', but that can be modified
by starting the IFR service using the -o option (see above).
All -ORB options appear in the command line before any other
options, since the -ORB options are consumed by CORBA::ORB_init.

tao_ifr can process multiple IDL files in one execution. As
long as the filenames come after any -ORB options that may
be present, they may come mixed in any order with the other
command line options. The tao_ifr command line parser will
treat any option (or option pair) that doesn't begin with 
'-' as a filename.

More information about the Interface Repository and tao_ifr can 
be found in ACE_ROOT/TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html.
