    </CENTER>

    <H3>Configuring the Event Channel at Compilation Time</H3>

    <P>TAO's Real-Time Event Channel can be configured at compilation
      time to use a different payload than its default.  To do so
      there are several options:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI><P>To eliminate the <CODE>CORBA::Any</CODE> field in the
          event payload you should define the
          <CODE>TAO_LACKS_EVENT_CHANNEL_ANY</CODE>
          macro when invoking the IDL compiler.
          You can do as follows:
<PRE>
$ cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
$ make TAO_IDLFLAGS=-DTAO_LACKS_EVENT_CHANNEL_ANY
</PRE>
        </P>
      </LI>
      <LI><P>Similarly you can eliminate the octet sequence field in
          the event payload using:
<PRE>
$ cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
$ make TAO_IDLFLAGS=-DTAO_LACKS_EVENT_CHANNEL_OCTET_SEQUENCE
</PRE>
        </P>
      </LI>
      <LI><P>Finally you can provide your own event payload, to do
          this you should Replace the contents of the
          <CODE>RtecDefaultEventData.idl</CODE>
          and define some IDL structure named
          <CODE>RtecEventData</CODE>.
          For example, you could define you own event type as follows:
<PRE>
// Replace RtecDefaultEventData.idl with this:

struct RtecEventData
{
  sequence&lt;long&gt; my_event_payload;
};
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <H3>Run-time Configuration</H3>

    <P>The new implementation of the real-time event channel uses a
      factory to build all the objects and strategies it requires.
      The factory can be dynamically loaded using ACE Service
      Configurator, this is extremely convenient because the factory
      can also parse options in the Service Configurator script file.
    </P>

    <P>There are currently several implementations of the factory.
      <ul>
<li>The <em>default</em> factory supports all of
      the options below and most of the potential values, except as
      specifically indicated.
<li>
      The <em>sched</em> factory defines new option values as indicated
      below that allow the RTES to integrate with the Real-Time
      Scheduling Service.  Use of the <em>sched</em> factory requires
      that you link in the TAO_RTSchedEvent library.
<li>
        The <em>tpc</em> (thread per consumer) factory defines new
        options values as indicated below.  This
          strategy is similar to the MT dispatching strategy in that it
          separates the thread that receives the push() from a supplier
          from the thread that does the eventual push() to the
          consumer(s), but it differs from MT in that MT has a pool of
          threads pulling from a single queue and ultimately potentially
          servicing every consumer, whereas TPC has a queue for <em>each</em>
          consumer and, thus, a single thread dedicated to pushing to that
          consumer.  This insures that a badly-behaved consumer <b>CANNOT</b>
          have an adverse effect on the channel or supplier.<br>
        To use this new strategy you will have to replace the call in your code
          for <code>TAO_EC_Default_Factory::init_svcs()</code> with
          <code>TAO_EC_TPC_Factory::init_svcs()</code>.

<li>      The <em>basic</em> and <em>null</em> factories are hard-coded
      factories that do not support any configuration options.
      They both define simple configurations that may enable some
      applications to use the RTES in a smaller footprint.
      See the files
      <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.h</code>
      and <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.h</code>
      for details.
    </ul>
    </P>

<h3>Special Topic: Queue Configuration</h3>
    <p>
      In certain configurations such as <em>mt</em> and <em>tpc</em>,
      the RTES implementation uses something called
      <code>TAO_EC_Queue</code>, which is an in-memory queue that
      separates threads that receive <code>push()</code> invocations
      from suppliers from the threads that dispatch
      <code>push()</code> invocations to consumers.  A user of the
      RTES can configure some behaviors of this queue as well as
      behaviors when the queue reaches certain trigger points.  The
      configuration of these behaviors is a combination of
      compile-time and run-time specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queue itself has two trigger points for the number of
      invocations in the queue:
      <ul>
      <li><em>low-water mark (LWM)</em>, a lower threshold below which the
      queue allows more invocations to be placed into the queue;
      <li><em>high-water mark (HWM)</em>, an upper threshold above which the
      queue prevents more invocations from being added to the queue
      </ul>
    The values for these can be set at compile time via
    <code>TAO_EC_QUEUE_LWM</code> and <code>TAO_EC_QUEUE_HWM</code>
    for the low-water mark and high-water mark, respectively.
    <p>
      In addition, an application can specify what the RTES should do if a
      queue reaches the HWM, i.e., fills up.  This behavior is encapsulated in a
      derivation of an <code>ACE_Service_Object</code>, called
      <code>TAO_EC_Queue_Full_Service_Object</code>.  The RTES looks
      for a service object of a particular name (the default for this
      name is in macro TAO_EC_DEFAULT_QUEUE_FULL_SERVICE_OBJECT_NAME,
      which is "EC_QueueFullSimpleActions") and invokes
      <code>queue_full_action()</code> on the instance.  See class
      <code>TAO_EC_Simple_Queue_Full_Action</code> in file
      <code>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.h</code>
      for an example.  This particular example can be configured to
      either <em>wait</em> or <em>discard</em> new invocations on
      reaching the HWM.
    </p>

    <H3>The configuration file</H3>

    <P>The real-time event channel uses the same service configurator
      file that the ORB uses, the default name for this file is
      <CODE>svc.conf</CODE>, but the ORB option
      <CODE>-ORBSvcConf</CODE> can be used to override this.
      The format of the file is described in detail in
      the service configurator documentation, but the relevant section
      for the event channel looks like this:
    </P>

<PRE>
# Comments go here...
# More comments if you want to...
static EC_Factory "-ECFiltering basic ....."
# ...and optionally...
static EC_QueueFullSimpleActions "[wait | discard]"
# ...or you can define your own TAO_EC_Queue_Full_Service_Object,
#    give it whatever name you want and use -ECQueueFullServiceObject
#    (see below) to specify that object's service configurator tag.
</PRE>

    The
      table below describes all of the options (and values) supported by
      these factories.

            The <EM>null</EM> filtering strategy will build trivial

            The <EM>basic</EM> filtering strategy supports
            disjunction, conjunction, logical and, negation, bitmask,
            and timeout filters based on the subscriptions passed by
            the consumer during the connect call. It only supports limited
            nesting of filter groups.
            The <EM>prefix</EM> filtering strategy supports
            all filter types that the <EM>basic</EM> strategy does
            and allows unlimited nesting of filter groups.
            When using the <EM>prefix</EM> strategy, the source field of the
            group filter must specify the number of children in the group.
            The <EM>priority</EM> filtering strategy  (sched factory only)
            supports the same
            features as the <EM>basic</EM> filtering strategy, but it
            also collaborates with the scheduling service to build the
            dependency graph.

          <TD>The event channel can also perform some filtering close

            If the strategy is <EM>null</EM> then a global collection
            of consumers is maintained and each event is filtered by
            each consumer.
            If the strategy is <EM>per-supplier</EM> then the EC uses
            the supplier publications and the consumer subscriptions
            to determine which consumers could potentially be
            interested in events for each supplier.
            This set of consumers is usually smaller than the complete
            set and it is thus faster to traverse it, but keeping more
            collections of consumers increases the connection and
