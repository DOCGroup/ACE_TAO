This is test to exercise the corbaloc: and corbaname: style URL.  
The simple way to test is to run the run_test.pl.

The corbaloc: and corbaname: URL syntax is documented in Chapter
13.6.7 "Object URLs", of the CORBA 2.4.2 specification:
ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/01-02-01.pdf

To test manually:

1. Run the NamingService at a specified endpoint.

        $NamingService -m 1 -ORBEndPoint iiop://doc.ece.uci.edu:12345 &

2. Run the server.

        ./server STATUS -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:doc.ece.uci.edu:12345 &

        This will create a corbaloc::Status CORBA object and register
        the object reference in the Naming Service with the name
        STATUS.


3. The client takes in a corbaloc style URL for the CORBA
   Naming Service on the command-line.  The client will 
   first try to resolve the Naming Service using this corbaloc URL.
   The client will then try to resolve a corbaloc::Status object 
   (see corbaloc.idl) named "STATUS".
   The client will then try to invoke the print_status() method
   on this object.   

   Run the client as one of these:

 a)     ./client corbaloc::doc.ece.uci.edu:12345/NameService

        CORBALOC style URL is used and the protocol used to
        contact the naming context is <iiop> implicitly.

 b)     ./client corbaloc:iiop:doc.ece.uci.edu:12345/NameService

        CORBALOC style URL is used and the protocol used to
        contact the naming context is <iiop>.

 c)     ./client corbaloc:rir:/NameService

        CORBALOC style URL is used and the protocol used to
        contact the naming context is <rir>.

 d)     ./client corbaloc:rir:/

        CORBALOC style URL is used with resolve initial references (rir)
        format.  Since no object key is specified, it defaults
        to "NameService"


4.  The corbaname_client will try to look up an object in the
    CORBA Naming Service based on the corbaname URL passed in on the
    command line.   The corbaname_client will resolve the object,
    and then narrow it down to a corbaloc::Status object.  The
    corbaname_client will then try to invoke the print_status() method
    on the object.

    Run the corbaname_client as one of these:

 a)    ./corbaname_client corbaname:iiop:doc.ece.uci.edu:12345#STATUS

       - Specify the protocol, host, and port where the Naming Service is.
       - Resolve an object reference of name "STATUS".

 b)    ./corbaname_client corbaname::doc.ece.uci.edu:12345#STATUS

       - Do not specify the protocol (defaults to iiop).
       - Specify where the host and port of the Naming Service is.
       - Resolve an object reference of name "STATUS".

 c)    ./corbaname_client corbaname:rir:#STATUS

       - Determine where the Naming Service is by using 
         orb->resolve_initial_references("NameService")
       - Resolve an object reference of name "STATUS"
