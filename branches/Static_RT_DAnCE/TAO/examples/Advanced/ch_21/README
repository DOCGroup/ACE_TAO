Chapter 21 example.
______________________________________________________________________________
This example been taken from the book "Advanced CORBA Programming with C++" 
by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski. Copyright 1999. Addison-Wesley, Reading, 
MA.  To make the examples work with TAO, some minor modifications to the 
source code have been made, with permission, by Mike Moran <mm4@cs.wustl.edu>.
All of these changes are documented in the file CHANGES, in this directory.

Summary:
    This is example modifies the climate control system of chapter 12 to have
    a multithreaded server.  The client included here has been taken 
    from chapter 12.

Building:
    This example must be built with native C++ exceptions, and with an 
    ACE/TAO build with exceptions.  Make sure to use TAO_FLAG Ge=0 to 
    ensure that the IDL generated code uses c++ exceptions rather than 
    creating CORBA_Environment variables.

    With GNU make, simply type 
     % make exceptions=1
    to create the executable server and client.

server:
    The server takes no parameters nor command line options and returns an 
    IOR to stdout.  The server then waits infinatly for clients requests.

client:
    The client takes an IOR from the command line, narrows this to a 
    controller reference, makes several remote calls on this controller, and 
    finally terminates.

run_test.pl:
    This is currently a UNIX only script!  It starts up the server, redirecting
    stdout to a file, then passes the file's contents to the command line of
    the client.  After the client terminates, the server is killed.
