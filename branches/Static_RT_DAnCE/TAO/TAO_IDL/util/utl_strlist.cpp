// Implementation of a list of utl_string nodes.

// NOTE: This list class only works correctly because we use single public
//       inheritance, as opposed to multiple inheritance or public virtual.
//       It relies on a type-unsafe cast from UTL_List to subclasses, which
//       will cease to operate correctly if you use either multiple or
//       public virtual inheritance.
