This example is a very simple example, showing how to use the Kokyu
dispatcher to dispatch command objects in a EDF manner. The test
configures the Kokyu dispatcher with a single EDF lane. Typically this
would be done by an EDF scheduler which assigns priorities to tasks
based on the deadlines for tasks. To ensure that the command objects
enqueued in the dispatcher are dispatched in the correct order, we
enqueue the command objects and *then* activate the dispatcher. Only
when the dispatcher is activated, the thread watching each dispatch
queue starts running.

To run this example, 

./test -p<fifo|rr|other>

The following is the expected output

Deadline of command1 is 1065966081
Deadline of command2 is 1065966131
Deadline of command3 is 1065966031
command 3 executed
command 1 executed
command 2 executed

Note that the deadlines are absolute deadlines.
