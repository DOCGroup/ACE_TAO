This directory contains two sample logging applications that implement
and test the ACE distributed logging service.

	. indirect_logging.cpp

		This program talks to the ACE Client Logging Daemon on
		the localhost, which forwards the messages to Server
		Logging Daemon.  The Client Logging Daemon and Server
		Logging Daemon both must be started before you can run
		this test. 

	. direct_logging.cpp

		This program talks directly to the Server Logging
		Daemon.  The Server Logging Daemon must be started
		before you can run this test. 

To start these daemons, please check out the ../../servers/ directory.
