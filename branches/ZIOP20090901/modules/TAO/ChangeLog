      * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
        Completed the circle. Reply data from a server gets decompressed 
        when received by a client.

      * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
        Fixed logging error.
      
      * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
      * tao/PortableServer/Upcall_Wrapper.cpp:
        Move compression of reply message from Upcall_Wrapper.cpp
        to IIOP_Transport.cpp.
      
      * tao/ZIOP/ZIOP.cpp:
        Fixed errors during decompression. 
        Changed marshal reply data. Marshalling of arguments
        isn't necessary anymore; just compress everything after
        the header.
        For decompress and compress, set TAO_GIOP_MESSAGE_SIZE_OFFSET 
        in order to represent the correct number of bytes.

      * tao/ZIOP/ZIOP.h:
      * tao/ZIOP_Adapter.h:
        Changed function of marshal_reply_data.
        Only TAO_OutputCDR and TAO_ORB_Core are needed here.

      * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp
        Decompress input changed from TAO_ServerRequest to TAO_InputCDR.
        Added log info after decompression. The user is able to view the
        decompressed data.
        Indication whether it's a GIOP or a ZIOP message in dump_msg.
      
      * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp
        Added log info before compression. The user is able to 
        view the data before it is compressed.
        
      * tao/ZIOP/ZIOP.cpp
        Decompress input changed from TAO_ServerRequest to TAO_InputCDR.
        Also change header into ZIOP message after compression.
        No consolidation when compression starts and setting
        the read pointer right after the GIOP header before compression.
        No marshalling of the input arguments.
     
      * tao/ZIOP/ZIOP.h
      * tao/ZIOP_Adapter.h
        Decompress input changed from TAO_ServerRequest to TAO_InputCDR.

      * tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
        Moved code to decompess data to 
        process_request_message function.
      
      * tao/GIOP_Message_State.cpp:
        Magic bytes may also contain a 'Z' as first byte.
      
      * tao/Remote_Invocation.cpp:
      * tao/Synch_Invocation.cpp:
        Moved marshalling of compressed messages from 
        Remote_Invocation.cpp to Synch_Invocation.cpp.
