This example shows the use of ORT Template by a simple application.

Scenario:
========
	
1. There's a server which has a dummy method that adds the two 'in' variables
   and return the sum to the client.

2. There is a Gateway which receives the requests on behalf of the
   server and redirects to the server. So the client never knows about
   the actual server but only the gateway.

3. And, as always we will have a client that invokes the server
   method.

Files and Small Description
=====================


Gateway.idl			IDL for the Gateway

Gateway_IORInterceptor		IORInterceptor for the Gateway.

Gateway_i			Implementation of the Gateway which changes the 				DSI to DII.

Object_Factory_i		Implementation for the
				Gateway IDL method. This method
				creates a reference which points to the gateway
				instead of the server.

gateway_server			As the name means, gateway server
				implementation.

sum_server.idl			idl for the sum_server.

server				The main server which is being
				gatewayed by the gateway

sum_server_i			Implementation of sum_server.idl methods.

client				Simple client which invokes the sum_server
				method add_variables.

How to run the example
======================

1. First run the IFR_Service.

% $IFR_Service

	It generates an ior in if_repo.ior by default.

2. Then, run the tao_ifr passing sum_server.idl as its argument,

% $tao_ifr sum_server.idl

3. Run the gateway server

% ./gateway_server -o gateway_ior -ORBInitRef IFR_Service=file://if_repo.ior

4. Run the actual server.

% ./server -o server_ior -ORBInitRef Gateway_Object_Factory=file://gateway_ior

5. Run the client

% ./client -k file://server_ior
