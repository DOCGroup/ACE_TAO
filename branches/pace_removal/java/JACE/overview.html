Java ACE is a collection of Java packages containing classes that have been 
converted from the C++ version of the 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ADAPTIVE Communication 
Environment</A> (ACE).
<P>
The C++ version of ACE is a large object-oriented network programming toolkit 
which contains over 125,000 lines of C++ code and uses advanced C++ features 
like templates.
</P>
<P>The goal of converting ACE from C++ to Java is to provide a portable 
programming toolkit with a similar interface and functionality to the original
 version of ACE. This allows new and current users of C++ ACE an easy transition
to Java and also adds significant value to programming concurrent Java 
networking applications. Note that applications written using Java ACE can 
communicate seamlessly over sockets with applications written using C++ ACE.
</P>
<P>
The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the Java version of ACE:

<P>
The Java ACE architecture has fewer components than the diagram illustrating 
the architecture for the 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-overview.html">C++ version 
of ACE </A>. This reduction in size occurs for two reasons. First, the Java 
Virtual Machine (JVM) handles many of the portability issues provided by C++ 
ACE. Therefore, the OS adaptation layer is unnecessary. Second,
Java doesn't support certain OS features provided by Win32, UNIX, and other 
OS platforms that C++ ACE is ported to.  For example, Java doesn't support 
shared memory and memory-mapped files and therefore the memory management 
wrappers (such as <CODE>Mem_Map</CODE> and <CODE>Shared_Malloc</CODE>) are 
omitted from Java ACE.
</P>

<P>
The process of converting ACE from C++ to Java provided us with an excellent 
source of insights on the strengths and weaknesses of using Java for 
industrial-strength software system frameworks. We've written a paper 
documenting our 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/C++2java.html">experiences</A> 
converting the C++ version of ACE to Java.

My goal is to see Java ACE continue to evolve and become a more
comprehensive, robust, and well-documented Java toolkit that is freely
available to researchers and developers. If you have any
improvements, suggestions, and or comments, I'd like to hear about it.
