Wed May 19 16:23:18 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Pluggable.cpp (TAO_Transport): Hardcoded <Wait_On_Read>
	strategy.  

	* tao/Connect.cpp: Changes to <ST_Client_Connection_Handler> in
	order to get the <Wait_On_Reactor> to work.  

	* tao/Pluggable.cpp: Hard coding <Wait_On_Reactor> instead of
	<Wait_On_Read>. 

	* tao/GIOP.cpp: Incrementing the <message_offset> in the Tranport
	object updating the state of the incoming message.

	* tao/IIOP_Wait_Strategy.cpp: Implemented <Wait_On_Reactor>
	strategy. Not well tested yet.  

Tue May 18 11:43:13 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

	Got <Wait_On_Read strategy> to work with the new architecture. 

	* tao/IIOP_Reply_Dispatcher.h: 
	* tao/IIOP_Reply_Dispatcher.cpp: Implementation for
	the Reply Dispatcher strategies. (Synchronous and Asynchronous). 

	* tao/IIOP_RMS.h :
	* tao/IIOP_RMS.cpp: Implementation of two different Request
	Multiplexing Strategies. (Multiplexed and Exclusive)

	* tao/IIOP_Wait_Strategy.h: 
	* tao/IIOP_Wait_Strategy.cpp: Implementations for the three
	different Wait strategies (Wait_On_Read, Wait On Reactor and Wait
	on Leader Follower). 

	<Transport> object creates Request Multiplexing Strategy <RMS>
	object and <Wait Strategy> object.

 	After this, Invocation class intializes the <RMS> object with the
	<CDR> stream it has to use to read the input (reply). Right now,
	since we deal only with the Synchronous Method Invocation (SMI)
	model, the <GIOP_Twoway_Invocation> class gives the pointer to the
	preallocated <CDR> stream that it owns, to the <RMS> object. 

	Invocation is made and then Invocation calls <wait_for_reply> on
	the <Transport> object. <Transport> object calls <wait> on the
	<Wait Strategy> object. 

	Right now the <Wait Strategy> is hard coded to be only <Wait On
	Read> and the <RMS> is hard coded to be only
	<Exclusive_RMS>. Since we want to block on read in the
	<Wait_On_Read> strategy, the <GIOP::recv_request> call now takes
	additional parameter whether to block for the whole reply or
	not. Non-blocking case is not yet tested fully. 

	Remember the <handle_client_input> of the <Transport> object does
	all the reading of the reply and also calls back the
	<Reply_Dispatcher>. Right now in the <Exclusive RMS> case, we use
	only the <Syncronous Reply Dispatcher>. <dispatch_reply> on this
	object does nothing. It just stores all the information related to
	the reply (reply status ...etc). The invocation object demarshalls
	the reply CDR (which it gave to the Transport earlier) on the stack.

Thu May  6 12:11:22 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* Many thanks and kudos to Torsten Kuepper
	  <kuepper2@uni-wuppertal.de> who contributes an initial
	  implementation of Object-by-Value to TAO. His ChangeLog entry
	  follows:

	* TAO/tao/Makefile:
	* TAO/TAO_IDL/Makefile:
	* TAO/tao/orbconf.h:
	* TAO/TAO_IDL/include/idl.h:
	  Support of Valuetypes if TAO_HAS_OBV resp. IDL_HAS_OBV is
	  defined.
	  This is far from complete. However
	  + you are able to pass valuetypes as arguments in operation
	  signatures (see examples/OBV).
	    - Valuetype as member of other types (union, sequence ...) is
	    missing until the compiler backend is provided with visitors
	    for that.
	  + A valuetype could have a valuetype as state member, ...
	    - ... but currently the sharing of valuetypes in the context
	    of an invocation is not yet implemented. This means you got
	    two out of one (if two references point to one object) and
	    cyclic references are not feasible.
	  + The marshalling code accesses the state member data directly
	    for optimization (-Wb,obv_opt_accessor).
	    - This will be changed for unoptimized (standard) valuetypes,
	      where the implementer should be able to override the
	      accessor/modifier functions even for marshalling. Currently
	      she isn't able to do so.
	    - The marshalling does no fragmentation (chunking) yet. But
	      this is required for custom marshalling and truncation.
	    - Ordinary (not hashed) repository ids are used. Some code is
	      missing that would optimize sending repo ids away (if the
	      formal parameter is equal the current type) or that
	      backreferences earlier send repository ids, when marshalling
	      a graph.
	    - The code generated for typedefs and forwards of valuetypes
	      is not complete and will not compile.
	    - Support of an interface is not yet there. Perhaps the TIE to
	      a valuetype may give comparable functionality.
 	    - Abstract interfaces are not implemented too.
	    - TypeCode for valuetypes are missing, and without that,
	      packing a valuetype into an any is not yet possible.
	    - init () is not yet mapped to create () in the _init
	      class. But you can declare create () on your own in your
	      factory class.
	    - Some helper classes (e.g. _var for ValueFactory) are
	      missing.
	  And I have confused a few issues on constness in modifier
	  functions and members (in _init) which should be private and
	  friend of another class, but it didn't want to compile right. I
	  will correct these points, when I have the time.

	* TAO/examples/OBV/Typed_Events [new]:
	  Demonstration of Typed Events, e.g. measuring values. The idea
	  is to have common attributes (time and origin id) and operations
	  (do_print()) in a base class.
	  The event (temperature, position...) that is derived from the
	  base is created in one process and is passed (type safe) to
	  another process which invokes member function of the base class
	  to do something with this concrete event (e.g. show, perform a
	  test).
	  (Naturally, the receiving process must have an implementation of
	  the valuetypes.)

	* TAO_IDL/idl_global.h:
	* TAO_IDL/utl_global.cpp:
	* TAO_IDL/drv_args.cpp:
	* TAO_IDL/be/be_args.cpp:
	  New TAO_IDL options
	    -Gv   enable OBV (Valuetype)
	    -Sv   disable OBV (Valuetype) (currently default)
 	          read option with idl_global->obv_support()
	    -Wb,obv_opt_accessor  Nonvirtual inline accessor/modifier
	    functions
	  Currently it is necessary to use compiled marshalling (-Gc) when
	  using the valuetype feature.

	* TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
	* TAO_IDL/fe/fe_init.cpp:
	  Compiler FE recognizes the OBV token (abstract, custom, init,
	  private, public, supports, truncatable, valuetype) (CORBA 2.3
	  3.2.4), but only if it is compiled with IDL_HAS_OBV and -Gv is
	  given.

	* TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy:
	  There are some new productions in the parser. member is now a
	  wrapper for member_i, which previously was member but now
	  accesses $0 as visibility parameter.

	* TAO_IDL/include/ast_generator.h:
	* TAO_IDL/be/be_generator.cpp:
	* TAO_IDL/include/ast_interface.h:
	* TAO_IDL/ast/ast_interface.cpp:
	* TAO_IDL/include/ast_interface_fwd.h:
	* TAO_IDL/ast/ast_interface_fwd.cpp:

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_field.cpp:
	* TAO_IDL/be_include/be_valuetype.h [new]:
	* TAO_IDL/be/be_valuetype.cpp [new]:
	* TAO_IDL/include/fe_interface_header.h:
	* TAO_IDL/fe/fe_interface_header.cpp:
	  AST_Interface is currently used for valuetypes too.  (This
	  attempt was made for better staying in sync with the rushing TAO
	  development.)
	  Though lots of code for name lookup and inheritance rules can be
	  reused. AST_Interface has the new methods is_valuetype(),
	  is_abstract_valuetype() and is_abstract_interface() which allows
	  the frontend to distinguish them. Later on a new AST_ class
	  should  be refactored which is a base class to the IDL types
	  that provide inheritance.

	  Some shared code in idl.yy is now in AST_Interface::redefine()
	  and AST_Interface::fwd_redefinition_helper(). Forward definition
	  is a little changed, that the dummy full definition be_ object
	  stored in AST_InterfaceFwd is of the right type.

	  FE_InterfaceHeader::compile_inheritance () is extended with the
	  rules to check right inheritance of valuetypes and abstract
	  interfaces.
	  The constructor of FE_InterfaceHeader has now a default
	  parameter which let the derived FE_obv_header invoke
	  compile_inheritance () at later time.

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/*.cpp [new]:

	  The visiting of valuetype is integrated into the root and module
	  visitors. The OBV_ classes resp. namespaces are generated in an
	  extra pass over the syntax tree.

	* tao/corba.h:
	* tao/corbafwd.h:
	* tao/ValueBase.h [new]:
	* tao/ValueBase.i [new]:
	* tao/ValueBase.cpp [new]:
	  All valuetypes inherit from the CORBA::ValueBase. It has
	  abstract operations for the reference counting, which are
	  implemented by multiply inherit from
	  e.g. CORBA::DefaultValueRefCountBase.
	  _copy_value () is not yet implemented.
	  There is some internal stuff for doing [un]marshalling and
	  dynamic type conversion (used by _downcast ()), whose
	  underlaying mechanism is like in the tao_idl compiler
	  itself:
	    The static member _downcast () calls a virtual function, which
	    is implemented from the IDL compiler, with an id of the wanted
	    type. These it is compared against the actual id of the
	    object. In case of mismatch the ancestors of the valuetype are
	    called (in depth first order).
	  _downcast () is used during unmarshaling too. This may result in
	  quite undeterministic real time behaviour. The worst case would
	  be that the _downcast walks the complete inheritance graph.
	  The detailed marshaling is best studied from the comments in
	  ValueBase.cpp.

	* tao/ValueFactory.h [new]:
	* tao/ValueFactory.i [new]:
	* tao/ValueFactory.cpp [new]:
	* tao/ValueFactory_Map.h [new]:
	* tao/ValueFactory_Map.i [new]:
	* tao/ValueFactory_Map.cpp [new]:
	  The map of registered valuetype factories.
	  TAO_OBV_REGISTER_FACTORY macro is for on the fly factory
	  registration, but its not like in the OMG specs.

	* tao/ORB.h:
	* tao/ORB.cpp:
	  Integration of the factory map for valuetypes with the ORB.
	  It is accessed through CORBA_ORB::register_value_factory (),
	  unregister_value_factory () and lookup_value_factory ().
	  This needs some revision to make the changing of the map thread
	  safe and changes to make it per ORB and not per process as it is
	  currently.

	* */Makefile:
	  Many makefile dependencies updated.

	* examples/Simple/chat/Makefile:
	  The dependencies did not include Client_i.cpp or Server_i.cpp

	* orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makefile:
	  Added dependencies to for parallel compilation.

Thu May  6 09:24:30 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
	  Small changes in debugging messages.

Wed May 05 15:11:26 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.i (Time_Value_to_TimeT):
          replaced static cast of ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_NSECS to ACE_UINT32
          with ACE_U_ONE_SECOND_IN_NSECS, so we don't cast away
          constness.

Wed May 05 13:07:49 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * all Makefiles: replaced /bin/rm with $(RM) and /bin/mv with mv.

Wed May  5 12:58:14 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
          Calibrate the High_Res_Timer before starting the test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
          The last shutdown event was not properly initialized.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Driver.cpp:
          Corrected variance computation and use the
          ACE_High_Res_Timer::global_scale_factor() to map from
          ACE_hrtime_t to microseconds.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Priority_Dispatching.cpp:
          For experimentation purposes the dispatching thread runs at a
          higher priority that the supplier threads. This minimizes the
          latency because the dispatching thread becomes runnable as soon
          as there is data available.
          Of course this will be controlled by the scheduler in production
          code.

Wed May 05 12:20:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp: added missing
          template instantiations for ACE_RB_Tree_Iterator_Base.  Thanks
          to David Levine for reporting this.

Wed May 05 09:52:18 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/Makefile: added subset dependency
          on Event2, because it needs the TAO_EC_Event_Channel ctor.

Wed May  5 02:20:15 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/Environment.{h,i,cpp}:
          Added _var and _out classes.

        * tao/Any.{h,i,cpp}:
          Edited the comment for the Any_var extraction
          operators, added the Any_out -> operator, which
          was missing, and made a cosmetic change to Any.cpp.

        * tao/Typecode.{h,i}:
          Moved the operator assigning a TypeCode_var to a
          TypeCode_out to private: and removed the
          implementation - it's not allowed.

Tue May  4 23:50:04 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/ORB.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Typecode_Constants.cpp:
          Added typedef'd strings ORBid to CORBA and
          ObjectId to CORBA_ORB, along with their typecodes.

          Also moved the typecode initialization for the exception
          InconsistentTypeCode out of ORB.cpp and into
          Typecode_Constants. Also cosmetized Typecode_Constants
          a little.

Tue May  4 21:46:31 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          Fixed memory managment problems with the new implicit option
          -I$TAO_ROOT/tao, also use $ACE_ROOT/TAO if TAO_ROOT is not
          defined and print a warning message if none is defined.

Tue May  4 21:15:51 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching_Task.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Priority_Dispatching.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Priority_Dispatching.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Priority_Dispatching.cpp:
          Added new Dispatching strategy that uses multiple threads (one
          per priority) and a queues to dispatch the events. This strategy
          allows invocations from high-priority suppliers to low-priority
          consumers or vice-versa with minimum priority inversion.
          It also decouples the collocated suppliers from the time spent
          in the collocated consumers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.cpp:
          Added support for the new dispatching strategy and for Immediate
          changes in the supplier sets, but with locking.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Before passing data to the dispatching module we increment the
          reference count, that way the dispatching module doesn't have to
          do it and we minimize locking overhead.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic changes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          Enabled debug message if an empty event is received.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ec.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ec.mt.conf:
          Added new configuration for Priority_Dispatching strategy.
          Re-ordered options in old configuration to match the new one.

Tue May  4 20:23:37 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{h.cpp}:
          Change the signature of the constructor
            CORBA_Any (CORBA::TypeCode_ptr type,
                       const ACE_Message_Block* mb)

          to

            CORBA_Any (CORBA::TypeCode_ptr type,
                       COREBA::UShort dummy,
                       const ACE_Message_Block* mb)

          in order to avoid ambiguity with a call to

            CORBA_Any (CORBA::TypeCode_ptr type,
             void *value = 0,
             CORBA::Boolean any_owns_data = 0)

          where the second arg is NULL and the third arg
          is left out.

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Changed the signature of all the calls to the above
          constructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp:
          Fixed the '*/ outside of comment' warning.

Tue May  4 20:17:41 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CORBA.pidl:
        New file for adding entries that would generate new typecodes

1999-05-04  Seth Widoff  <swidoff@cs.cmu.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTrading.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTradingRepos.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTradingDynamic.idl:
          Broke the CosTrading.idl file up so that each idl file
          gets one module.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterators.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:
          For the stem_id used in federated query, obliterated the calls
          to rand_r, since they apparently return -1 on NT. Since random
          numbers were kind of a cludge anyway, the trader now establishes
          a unique sequence number space by generating a prefix consisting
          of IP address and process id. If the trader is running on a
          machine without an IP address, then it defaults to a random
          prefix (using plain old rand, this time). Thanks to
          Ulf Jährig <ujaehrig@desys.com> for pointing this problem out.

          I also adapted all servants in the trader to use POA reference
          counting.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Offer_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/TT_Info.cpp:
          Fixed the includes to respect the new idl file schema.

Tue May  4 17:45:43 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/orb.idl:
          Added this file as required by CORBA spec. Contains only
          empty interface defs for ORB, TypeCode and Object, inside
          module CORBA, so the IDL compiler can recognize 'CORBA::'
          scoped versions of the above. Interface defs suggested by
          Carlos, who also says we may need to add to them later.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          Added a line to include the $TAO_ROOT/tao directory in the
          preprocessor invocation, so it can find orb.idl.

Tue May  4 14:11:43 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/sfp.cpp: Fixed the misinterpretation of the
          credit message where I was adding the cred_num field to the
          allowed credit. Its actually a sequence number and the credit
          doesn't change for a session. Thanks to Leif Jakobsmeier
          <leif@cs.uni-frankfurt.de> for pointing this out.

Tue May  4 12:34:08 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:
          The IDL compiler can use either templates or explicit code for
          the classes mapped from IDL sequences.  I cleaned up the macros
          to control which scheme is used by default on each platform.
          The complete documentation is in orbconf.h next to
          TAO_USE_SEQUENCE_TEMPLATES

Tue May 04 12:15:06 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp (dispatch_servant_i): replaced
          direct comparison of ACE_thread_t's with ACE_OS::thr_equal ().
          Thanks to Steven D. Chen <sdc2951@aw101.iasl.ca.boeing.com>
          for reporting this on HP-UX and for verifying the fix.

Tue May 04 12:03:52 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile,tmplinst-orbsvcs.cpp:
          removed tmplinst-orbsvcs.cpp, because none of its
          explicit instantiations appear to be used.

          Arranged orbsvcs subsets so that the Naming Service
          is always built.  Many examples and tests need it.

        * docs/configurations.html: removed note about orbsvcs
          subsets not considering dependencies between the services.
          The hard-coded dependencies and Makefile dependencies
          should take care of that now.

Tue May  4 09:47:04 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp:
          Completed implementation of the EC_Basic_ObserverStrategy.
          Fixed computation of the consumers subscription list.
          Thanks to J. Russell Noseworthy <rnosewor@objectsciences.com>
          for helping out with this.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.cpp:
          Added locking on the SupplierAdmin object, the ConsumerAdmin
          does not need it since the locking is handled by its
          SupplierSet.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp:
          Cleaned up publication list computation, thanks to J. Russell
          Noseworthy <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for helping out with
          this.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/svc.conf:
          Added locks for the ConsumerAdmin and SupplierAdmin modules.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fixes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/svc.conf:
          Added the right configuration options for the new EC.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp:
          Added initialization of the EC_Default_Factory.
          Workaround what appears to be a bug in glibc2 implementation of
          rand_r(), it returns negative values but it should only return
          numbers in the range [0,RAND_MAX)

Mon May  3 23:46:31 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          Added a line to suppress inclusion of "fooC,h" and
          "fooS.h" if foo.idl is "orb.idl". We're not
          fully functional with '#include <orb.idl>' yet -
          more changes to come.

Mon May 03 22:02:34 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_expression.h: reverted replacement of
          LongLong with Long for GreenHills/Solaris, because it'll
          take a lot more than that.

Mon May 03 21:57:56 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.cpp,TAO_IDL/be/be_init.cpp,
          TAO_IDL/driver/drv_{args,fork,preproc}.cpp,
          TAO_IDL/fe/fe_init.cpp,TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:
          replaced exit (n) with ACE_OS::exit (n).  Thanks
          to Steve Huston for reporting this abomination.

Mon May  3 18:31:25 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.{h,cpp}:
          Updated format of a CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT exception and
          removed a leading underbar from an 'is_a' so that
          declaration, definition and call signature all agree.

Mon May  3 17:19:26 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{h,i}:
          Added insertion and extraction operators for Any_var.
          CORBA spec requires these for all copying insertion
          operators defined as members of Any. The extraction
          operators are there as a tip of the hat to user of
          other ORBs that may be used to them.

Mon May  3 16:09:24 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Server_Reqeust.*:
        * tao/GIOP_Server_Request.*:

          Changed all references to IIOP_ServerRequest to GIOP_ServerRequest
          since the implementation is GIOP-specific, not IIOP-specific.

        * tao/UIOP_Server_Request.*:

          A UIOP-specific ServerRequest class is no longer needed since
          the UIOP case falls under the GIOP case.  Removed these files.

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
        * tao/UIOP_Connect.cpp:

          Changed references to IIOP_ServerRequest and UIOP_ServerRequest
          to GIOP_ServerRequest since both transport protocols fall under
          GIOP.

Mon May  3 15:53:45 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/include/AST_Expression.h:
          Used #if defined (ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T) to conditionally
          define a longlong and unsigned longlong as a long and
          an unsigned long, respectively. This in only to make
          GreenHills/Solaris happy. Thanks to David Levine for
          reporting the problem.

Mon May 03 15:26:19 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Adapter.h: added "class" in friend
          declarations.

Mon May 03 10:39:33 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.21 released.

Mon May 03 10:18:24 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/MT_Client_Test/Makefile:
          removed unused orbsvcs references.

Mon May 03 10:04:00 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/POA/Demux/Makefile,
          tests/InterOp-Naming/Makefile: only build if the
          orbsvcs library was built with the Naming component.

Mon May 03 09:46:31 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile: removed
          use of orbsvcs headers and lib.  They're no longer needed.

Sun May 02 22:11:42 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: always build Trader with LifeCycle.

Sun May 02 22:09:42 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/{Consumer,Supplier}Admin_i.cpp,
          EventChannel_i.cpp,ProxyPush{Consumer,Supplier}_i.cpp:
          added auto_ptr and ACE_Auto_Basic_Ptr explicit instantiations,
          for old g++.

Sun May 02 22:05:46 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.cpp (create_dispatching):
          put ??? in a comment, so that old g++ doesn't complain
          about encountering a trigraph.

Sun May  2 15:57:33 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/Command_Handler.cpp:
          Removed the call to remove_handlers () in the ~Command_Handler
          to avoid double deletion of the signal handler.

Sun May 02 14:47:58 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp: removed
          ACE_Reverse_Lock<ACE_Lock> and ACE_Guard<ACE_Reverse_Lock<ACE_Lock> >
          explicit template instantiations because they're in
          tao/Object_Adapter.cpp.

Sun May 02 14:32:44 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.i (Time_Value_to_TimeT):
          added static cast of ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_NSECS to ACE_UINT32
          so that it will compile with ACE_LACKS_U_LONGLONG_T.

Sun May 02 14:02:23 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: always build Sched with Event
          or Event2.  Added dependency on Event's IDL_SRC's.  Thanks
          to Carlos for letting me know that these are necessary.
          Reordered subset support to be top-to-bottom, so that
          lower level services can be easily included if needed
          only by higher level services.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Makefile,orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:
          added dependency on TAO_ORBSVCS Naming.  Thanks to Carlos for
          pointing out that these modules use Naming.

Sun May 02 11:55:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs\orbsvcs\Sched\Reconfig_Scheduler.{cpp, h, i} (new)
          orbsvcs\orbsvcs\Scheduler_Factory.h: Very early draft
          of the reconfigurable scheduler implementation.

Sun May 02 08:15:50 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Context.cpp: removed ACE_Unbounded_Queue<char *>
          explicit instantiations, because they're in ace/ARGV.cpp
          (except ACE_HAS_MOSTLY_UNICODE_APIS, which we only use on
          WIN CE).

Sun May  2 00:12:40 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/Command_Handler.cpp:
          Fixed the code to restart the event loop for Audio Buffer and
          Video Buffer process for the java init case when the Java Gui
          sends ior to the mpeg client.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_mib/mibButton.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_mib/mibLabel.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_mib/mibList.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_mib/mibToggle.cpp:
          Fixed compilation errors for using unsigned char * instead of
          XmString on SunOS5.7 CC 4.2. Thanks to Bala for helping with this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_server/Globals.h:
          Fixed a redundant redinition warnings for macros nextByte and
          computePicSize.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_shared/routine.{h,cpp}:
          Fixed void usleep to int usleep to avoid ambiguity errors on
          SunOS5.7 CC 4.2.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server/Machine_Properties.cpp:
          Redefined xdr_void to int xdr_void (XDR *,void *) to fix
          compilation errors on SunOS5.7 CC 4.2.

Sat May  1 23:30:08 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i_T.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Endpoint_Strategy_T.cpp:
          Added the correct implementation of destroy method according to
          Irfan's suggestion.  Also corrected some TAO_ macros used for
          exceptions.

Sat May  1 22:01:41 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.h:
          added virtual destructors.

Sat May  1 21:01:40 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/compiled_marshal_cs.cpp: Stub
          code generation was not checking inout args for the char, wchar,
          boolean and octet cases, where the Any::to_* structs must be
          used when demarshaling. Result was 'ambiguous >> operator' error
          in compilation. Added the switch statement, checks and code
          generation. Thanks to englishmalc@my-dejanew.com for reporting
          this bug.

Sat May  1 17:44:34 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): Make sure we close down the
          ACE_SOCK_Acceptor so we don't leak handles.  Thanks to Vishal
          and James Johnson for tracking this down.

1999-05-01  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.i: Fixed the precision error.
          Use 64-bit precision for 64bit*32bit operation.  Thanks to
          Tom Venturella <Thomas.Venturella@MW.Boeing.com> for reporting
          that is had been using only 32-bit precision.

Sat May  1 15:06:40 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp (parameter): Changed the variable env to

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp (handle_input):
          Added stream.close () after stream.send_n () to explicitly
          close the socket.

          Thanks to James Johnson <jcej@lads.com> for finding this bug
          and suggesting the fix.

Sat May 01 08:22:12 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/run_test.pl:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i_T.cpp:
        Update the code to use ACE exception macros.
        Also updated the destroy method semantics to do POA deactivate.
        Removed unnecessary ACE_DEBUG's from the code.

Fri Apr 30 20:06:44 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode_Constants.cpp:
          Fixed a bunch of 'Memory in Use' reports from Purify
          reported by Irfan. Of a group of 10 Policy-related
          Typecodes in init(), only 3 had been added to fini().

Fri Apr 30 19:55:26 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.*:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.*:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.*:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.*:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.*:
        modified the CosEvent Channel to use reference counted
        servants.

Fri Apr 30 19:05:32 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.*:
        * tao/IIOP_Server_Request.*:
        * tao/UIOP_Server_Request.*:

          Moved IIOP specific stuff from Server_Request.* to
          IIOP_Server_Request.*.  Created UIOP-specific UIOP_Server_Request
          files based on the IIOP ones.

        * tao/Makefile:

          Added IIOP_Server_Request files to the Makefile and updated the
          dependencies.

        * tao/UIOP_Connect.{h,i,cpp}:

          Rough implementation of UIOP connection handlers based on the IIOP
          connection handlers.  Not operational yet.

        * tao/Connect.*:

          Changed all references of TAO_SVC_HANDLER to TAO_IIOP_SVC_HANDLER.

        * tao/LSOCK_*:
        * tao/UIOP_*:

          Changed all references of "LSOCK" to "UIOP" (except for ACE
          related LSOCK references).  Renamed all `LSOCK*' files to
          `UIOP*'.  Thanks to Fred for motivating these naming
          conventions.

Fri Apr 30 18:46:10 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sunsoft.cpp:
          Added a couple of cases to the character constant switch
          that eliminated the IDL compiler error messages
          produced from one of the test IDL files in the OMG tests.
          I don't think all of the IDL compiler tests have been run
          yet, so there may remain more to be done.

Fri Apr 30 17:41:31 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.{h,cpp}:
          Added a parameter() function. Although this function is gone
          from CORBA2.3a, it is still in 2.2 (though deprecated).

          Also found twp methods, ulong_param and typecode_param, that
          were internal hacks to use until other member functions had
          been written. They were never part of the spec and not now
          used by anything in TAO, orbsvcs, or any of the tests or
          examples, so they have been removed.

Fri Apr 30 14:06:41 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * COPYING: Updated the COPYING file to reflect the use new of
          ACE(TM) and TAO(TM).

Fri Apr 30 12:42:06 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_unbounded_obj_sequence_ch.cpp:
          Generate CORBA::default_environment() instead of
          CORBA::Environment::default_environment. It is easier to
          generate code for the TAO library that way and it is slightly
          more efficient.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.h:
          Added support for reference counting of ProxyPushConsumer and
          ProxyPushSupplier objects.
          Also fixed the initialization of the default_POAs for those
          classes and the Admin interfaces.
          Added strategized locking to the

        * tao/Context.h:
        * tao/Context.cpp:
          Use CORBA::defaul_environment() instead of
          CORBA::Environment::default_environment() that way we can
          include Context.h without requiring Environment.h
          Also reordered some includes in the .cpp file to validate the
          Context.h file on its own.

        * tao/IOR_LookupTable.cpp:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
          Protected some debug messages with TAO_debug_level. Also added a
          few more to check the iioploc support.

Fri Apr 30 11:58:23 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{h,cpp} (operator[]): Changed the return type from
          "const CORBA::Request_ptr" to "const CORBA::Request*".

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp (connect): Reordered the code
          to avoid putting compiler specific code here.

Fri Apr 30 02:05:22 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_i.cpp
          (Cubit_Factory_i): Make sure to deactivate the cubit servant (in
          addition to cubit factory servant) from the POA.

        * tao/TAO.cpp (deactivate_under_child_poa and deactivate): The
          code was incorrect in assuming that the <id> parameter is the
          object id; it is actually the ior. Anyway, it should work now.

Fri Apr 30 01:56:37 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h;
        * tao/Request.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/ORB.{h,cpp}:
          Added the RequestSeq class, inherited from
          TAO_Unbounded_Sequence. Used as an arg in the
          (no-op) new ORB functions send_multiple_requests_oneway()
          and send_multiple_requests_deferred(), although the
          RequestSeq class itself is fully functional, should any
          of this ever really get implemented.

          Added several spec-required ORB functions:
          - create_environment()
          - create_exceptions()
          - create_context_list()
          - create_named_value()
          - get_default_context()
          - send_multiple_requests_onewasy()
          - send_multiple_requests_deferred()
          - get_next_response()
          - poll_next_response()
          All of these are no-ops and just throw CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT.

Fri Apr 30 00:40:44 1999  Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Server_Manager.h:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Activator.h:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Loader.h:
          Changed TAO_TRY to ACE_TRY macros.
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Server_Manager.cpp:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Activator.cpp:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Loader.cpp:
          Added ACE_NEW_DECLARE_CORBA_ENV instead of ACE_TRY_NEW_ENV
          and also changed the CORBA::OBJECT_NOT_EXIST() exception
          to fit the current api.
        * examples/POA/Loader/Server_Manager.h:
        * examples/POA/Loader/Servant_Activator.h:
        * examples/POA/Loader/Servant_Loader.h:
          Changed TAO_TRY to ACE_TRY macros.

        * examples/POA/Loader/Servant_Activator.cpp:
        * examples/POA/Loader/Servant_Loader.cpp:
          Added ACE_NEW_DECLARE_CORBA_ENV instead of ACE_TRY_NEW_ENV
          and also changed the CORBA::OBJECT_NOT_EXIST() exception
          to fit the current api.

Thu Apr 29 22:12:25 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp:
        modified the dummy servants to use POA reference counting.

Thu Apr 29 19:58:03 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple: Added the new time-date example, which
          will illustrate how to dynamically link an ORB via the
          svc.conf!

Thu Apr 29 19:53:09 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp:
          Added corbafwd.h and Invocation.h to the projects.

Thu Apr 29 19:21:14 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp (find_servant_i): We are grabbing the
          lock in this function when we had already grabbed it in
          find_servant().  This causes a deadlock when the lock are
          non-recursive (i.e., on all non-NT platforms).  Thanks to Marina
          for helping with this.

Thu Apr 29 19:28:49 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Added the contexts() and env() operations to Request.
          Since this involved adding an env_ member to Request,
          I modified Objects's _create_request and _request
          methods to pass along their environment args to the
          Request constructors, whicn were also modified to
          accept them and initialize env_. This won't change the
          signature or the functionality of any existing code.

Thu Apr 29 19:16:04 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp (connect):
          Fixed a Vxworks warning for ACE_NOTREACHED in the connect
          function.Thanks to Irfan for pointing this out.

Thu Apr 29 18:35:52 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{h,cpp}:
          Added no-op versions of send_deferred, get_response,
          and poll_response. These just throw CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT.

Thu Apr 29 17:28:36 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        Added support to allow Policy objects to be locality constraint.
        This reduces the footprint of TAO when policy objects will never
        be accessed remotely.  You can enable this feature by defining
        TAO_HAS_LOCALITY_CONSTRAINT_POLICIES.

        * tao/POAC.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/CurrentS.cpp:
        * tao/POAS.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/POA_CORBA.h
        * tao/PolicyS.cpp: Other than supporting locality constraint
          policies, also removed unused op_tables, skeletons, stubs.

Thu Apr 29 16:33:31 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp: added
          ACE_Guard<ACE_Reverse_Lock<ACE_Lock> > explicit instantiation,
          for old g++.

Thu Apr 29 16:23:15 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/COPYING.sun: Split out the copyright information
          from the INSTALL.sun file.

Thu Apr 29 15:58:30 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/PP_Test_Server.{h,cpp}:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/server.dsp:
          Fixed servant deletion to deactivate under the POA
          before doing so. Also added some files to the server
          MSVC project for convenience.

Thu Apr 29 13:59:23 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Context.cpp: replaced # that was inadvertantly
          removed by last change.

Thu Apr 29 13:57:33 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Context.cpp:
          Fixed an include problem that was causing string_dup
          and string_free not to be found when linking to TAO.

Thu Apr 29 12:15:22 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Hash_Naming_Context.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Persistent_Naming_Context.cpp:
        Provided a temporary fix for the <destroy> methods, to avoid
        crashing since the new POA changes.  Appropriate fix will be
        committed soon together with the restructured version of Naming
        implementation classes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp:
        Updated for servants to deregister from POA before being destroyed.

Thu Apr 29 10:36:59 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Servant_Base.{h,cpp}: Changed the type of ref_count_ to
          CORBA::ULong and removed the template instantiation for
          Atomic_Ops.

Thu Apr 29 09:34:40 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/MT_Cubit_Test:
          check to see that the executables exist before trying
          to run them (and wait for the ior file to be created).

Thu Apr 29 06:41:34 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Context.cpp: removed ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX, CORBA::ULong>
          explicit instantiation because it was already in
          Exception.cpp.

Thu Apr 29 02:54:04 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * lots of .cpp files: Removed "TAO_DEFAULT_MINOR_CODE,
          CORBA::COMPLETED_NO" from many system exception instantiations
          because they are what the default constructors use.  Thanks to
          Irfan for suggesting this.

Thu Apr 29 01:23:03 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA (policies): Fixed destroy() methods of the policies by
          (a) removing "delete this" from the destroy() function, and (b)
          using servant/POA reference counting.

          The new destroy() function simply removes self from POA.
          Because of reference counting, the POA will automatically delete
          the servant when all pending requests on this servant are
          complete.

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp (TAO_Object_Adapter): Fixed memory leak
          by deleting dynamically allocated lock.

Wed Apr 28 21:16:55 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MessagingS.h: Removed inclusion of MessagingS_T.h.  Old g++
          cannot handle nested template classes properly.  This is the
          same reason we cannot compile examples/POA/TIE with old g++.

        * docs/Options.html: Removed -ORBpoa <global/tss> option since it
          does not make sense in the new ORB/POA architecture.

        * examples/Simple/echo/server.dsp:
        * examples/Simple/echo/client.dsp:

          Added release dependencies to the IDL compiler.

        * examples/POA/Reference_Counted_Servant/server.dsp: Updated this
          since some source files were removed.

        * examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): Added the
          use of SINGLE_THREAD_MODEL POA policy.  This helps in MT
          debugging of the POA.

Wed Apr 28 19:03:34 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/Context.{h,i,cpp}:
          Added an implementation of ContextList, based on TAO's
          implementation of ExceptionList, since the IDL definitions
          and the C++ mappings are very similar. Also added
          ContextList_var and ContextList_out classes.

          Added the methods from the OMG C++ mapping for Context.
          Since our support for Context is intentionally minimal,
          these methods just throw CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT. Wherever
          a Context_ptr is used as an argument in TAO, the only
          value it may have is 0 (or the above exception is raised).

        * Exception.h:
          Added the _var_type typedef to class Exception. It wouldn't
          compile before, because of a (just-discovered) typo in
          corbafwd.h.

Wed Apr 28 18:52:49 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Adapter:

          - Single_Threaded_POA_Lock: This class helps us by locking
            servants in a single threaded POA for the duration of the
            upcall.  Single_Threaded_POA_Lock has a magic constructor and
            destructor.  We acquire the servant lock in the constructor.
            We release the servant lock in the destructor.

        * tao/POA:

          - Added appropriate code for establishing and tearing down locks
            for servants in POAs with the SINGLE_THREAD_MODEL policy.

        * tao/Servant_Base:

          - Added a lock pointer to the servant base class.  This lock
            will be created when the servant is registered with a single
            threaded poa and removed/deleted when the servant is
            deactivated from the POA.

            Note that because a servant maybe registered with multiple
            single threaded POAs simultaneously, we do reference counting
            on this lock.

Wed Apr 28 18:05:38 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs[_static].dsp: Fixed dependencies of some
          idl files.

Wed Apr 28 15:21:33 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.cpp (deactivate_under_child_poa and deactivate): Changed
          object_id to object_id.in ().

Wed Apr 28 16:21:02 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile:
          moved BUILD definition to after wrapper_macros.GNU include,
          because that would always clobber it.  Thanks to Irfan
          for reporting that the IDL_Cubit server didn't get built
          first without this change.

        * tao/Policy_Manager.cpp:
        * tao/TAO.dsp
        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp
          Added the Messaging components to the NT build, not very
          relevant since this are just the skeleton features that we will
          need, but good for validation.

        * tao/MessagingS_T.i:
        * tao/MessagingS_T.cpp:
          Fixed problems under HP-UX/aCC thanks to Brian Wallis
          <Brian.Wallis@sr.com.au> for initially reporting this problem
          and helping us with the fix validation.

Wed Apr 28 10:07:54 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Reference_Counted_Servant/Makefile: added PSRC
          and re-ran make depend.  The old dependencies had a syntax error.

Wed Apr 28 09:47:05 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/CDR/octet_sequence.cpp: replaced use of cout
          with ACE_DEBUG statements.  Thanks to James D. Rucker
          <jdrucker@huey.jpl.nasa.gov> for reporting that it
          didn't build on VxWorks.

Wed Apr 28 09:19:24 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          ORB_init() was crashing if argv was nil or argc was 0, thanks to
          David for reporting this one.

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
          Use double checked pattern to reduce locking overhead in
          CORBA::instance(), the method is invoked on the critical path,
          that needs fixing too. Thanks to Irfan for reporting this
          problem.

        * tao/Exception.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiation.

Wed Apr 28 09:09:03 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:
          require Event2 TAO_ORBSVCS component, instead of Event.

        * tao/Exception.{h,i,cpp}: Added a new class
          CORBA_ExceptionList_var and changed the class
          CORBA_ExceptionList to enable reference counting.  Fixed the
          constructor's signature of all CORBA_SystemException's derived
          classes.  Thanks to Ian Pepper <ian@aptest.ie> for reporting
          this.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp: Added a typedef
          TAO_EC_Unlock to avoid MSVC errors.
          (reactive_push_to_consumer): Declared reverse_lock as
          TAO_EC_Unlock.

        * tao/corbafwd.h: Added typedef of ExceptionList_ptr and
          ExceptionList_var in CORBA's namespace.
          Added a macro definition TAO_DEFAULT_MINOR_CODE.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Locking.h: Changed system exception
          initialization signature using TAO_DEFAULT_MINOR_CODE.

        * lots of *.cpp files: Fixed system exception instantiations.

Wed Apr 28 02:07:42 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * created the directories orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/Factory
        * added the following files:
           orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/Factory/CosEventChannelFactory.idl:
            idl definition of the CosEventChannelFactory module.
           orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/FactoryCosEventChannelFactory_i.h:
           orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/Factory/CosEventChannelFactory_i.cpp:
            servant implementation of the CosEC Factory.
           orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/Factory/FactoryCosEventChannel_i.h:

Wed Apr 28 01:45:33 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Generic_Servant/MyFooServant.cpp (timed_operation):
          Added a timed operation.  This can be used to see how the POA
          dispatches multiple upcalls simultaneously.

        * examples/POA/Reference_Counted_Servant/server.cpp
          (Reference_Counted_Foo): There is no need to completely redefine
          Reference_Counted_Foo.  Simply use the magic of multiple
          inheritance and inherit from PortableServer::RefCountServantBase
          and MyFooServant.

Wed Apr 28 00:44:59 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.{h,cpp}:
           modified to use the new RtEC.

Tue Apr 27 23:32:52 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.cpp (deactivate_under_child_poa and deactivate): Added
          new methods to deactivate the servant.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Server.cpp
          (~Cubit_Server): Deactivate servant before deleting it.

Tue Apr 27 23:01:30 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the directory $TAO_ROOT/performance-tests/POA/Demux and the
        following files for the POA Demux tests.

        * Makefile
        * README
        * client.cpp : client for the tests.
        * demux_stats.cpp : To calculate statistics out of the timeprobe
          data generated.
        * demux_test.idl : IDL used for the test.
        * demux_test_client.cpp : Makes calls on the remote objects
          parameterized by the no. of POAs, servants and operations.
        * demux_test_client.h:
        * demux_test_client.i: Helper class for the client.
        * demux_test_i.cpp : Servant Implementation.
        * demux_test_i.h:
        * demux_test_macros.h: Some #defines for the test.
        * demux_test_server.cpp: Server for the test. Parameterized by the
          POA ID policy, lifespan policy, no. of servants, operations.
        * demux_test_server.h
        * names_file: Names used by the servants.
        * poa_names_100.dat: Names used by the POAs.
        * server.cpp : server main program.
        * write_names.cpp : generates the names_file.

Tue Apr 27 22:35:10 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp: Fixed template instantiations and
          constructor initialization order problems.

Tue Apr 27 21:46:08 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Eliminated priority inversion in the reactive dispatcher, we
          release the lock during the upcall to limit the time during
          which it is held.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.cpp:
          Use the "reactive_push_to_consumer()" method in the
          ProxyPushSupplier to ensure that the lock is released during the
          upcall.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter_Builder.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter_Builder.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp:
          The timeout "filters" need direct access to the
          ProxyPushSupplier.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Generator.cpp:
          Added a new callback method to the ProxyPushSupplier used by the
          Timeout filters to correctly grab the lock before dispatching
          the timeout.
          We need to control access to this kind of callback interfaces,
          possibly using helper classes with "friend" access.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ec.conf:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/svc.conf:
          By default use a regular mutex in the ProxyPushSupplier, it is
          more efficient and works correctly.

Tue Apr 27 17:27:16 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/LSOCK_Acceptor.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/LSOCK_Connector.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/LSOCK_Profile.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/LSOCK_Transport.{h,cpp}:

          These are the Unix Domain Socket pluggable protocol files for TAO.
          They are not operational yet, but getting them under CVS
          control at this point seems like a good thing to do.

Tue Apr 27 16:48:24 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA:

          - destroy_i: If the <wait_for_completion> parameter is TRUE, the
            destroy operation will return only after all requests in
            process have completed and all invocations of etherealize have
            completed. Otherwise, the destroy operation returns after
            destroying the POAs.

            If a servant manager is associated with the POA,
            ServantLocator::etherealize will be invoked with the oid and
            the servant. (The deactivate_object operation does not wait
            for the etherealize operation to complete before
            deactivate_object returns.)

            If the POA has no ServantActivator associated with it, the POA
            implementation calls _remove_ref when all operation
            invocations have completed. If there is a ServantActivator,
            the Servant is consumed by the call to
            ServantActivator::etherealize instead.

        * tao/Object_Adapter:

          - Non_Servant_Upcall: This class helps us with a recursive
            thread lock without using a recursive thread lock.
            Non_Servant_Upcall has a magic constructor and destructor.  We
            unlock the Object_Adapter lock for the duration of the
            non-servant (i.e., adapter activator and servant activator)
            upcalls; reacquiring once the upcalls complete.  Even though
            we are releasing the lock, other threads will not be able to
            make progress since
            <Object_Adapter::non_servant_upcall_in_progress_> has been
            set.

          - Outstanding_Requests: This class helps us by increasing
            <POA::outstanding_requests_> for the duration of the servant
            upcall. Outstanding_Requests has a magic constructor and
            destructor.  We increment <POA::outstanding_requests_> in the
            constructor.  We decrement <POA::outstanding_requests_> in the
            destructor.  Note that the lock is released after
            <POA::outstanding_requests_> is increased and
            <POA::outstanding_requests_> is decreased after the lock has
            been reacquired.

        * tao/Active_Object_Map:

          - Added <deactivated_> flag to each entry in the map. This flag
            is needed because there is a period of time between an
            object's deactivation and the etherealization (during which
            outstanding requests are being processed) in which arriving
            requests on that object should not be passed to its
            servant. During this period, requests targeted for such an
            object act as if the POA were in holding state until
            etherealize completes. If etherealize is called as a
            consequence of a deactivate call with a etherealize_objects
            parameter of TRUE, incoming requests are rejected.

          - bind_using_system_id(): Removed extra code: entry->system_id_
            = entry->user_id_; this was already happening in
            TAO_Active_Hint_Strategy::bind().

          - unbind_using_user_id(): Only unbind servant if non-zero.

        * tao/Servant_Base.h (TAO_ServantBase): Change reference count
          from ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX, CORBA::ULong> to
          ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX, long>.  This way we can utilize
          the InterlockedIncrement / InterlockedDecrement specializations
          for Atomic_Op on NT.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (create_and_set_root_poa): Fixed POA
          constructor call.

        * tao/default_server.cpp (enable_poa_locking): Changed server
          factory to simply inform Object Adapter if POA locking should be
          enabled.  The Object Adapter will create the proper lock.

Tue Apr 27 16:40:00 1999 Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Sched/Config_Scheduler.cpp: added some additional
          structure member initializations to remove uninitialized memory
          reads that were being reported by Purify.

Tue Apr 27 15:04:14 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
          Removed an incorrect "var" string appended to the
          local member name in the case where a union contains
          another union. Was causing a compile error in fooC.i.
          Thanks to Srikumar Kareti <skareti@htc.honeywell.com>
          for reporting this.

Tue Apr 27 12:01:38 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp (main): Changed to use
          TAO_EC_Default_Factory::init_svcs () to add the static service
          into service configurator.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp (connect):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Persistent_Context_Index_T.cpp (init):
          Added ACE_NOTREACHED macros.  KAI compiler is pretty good at
          figuring out unreachable statements.

Mon Apr 26 16:49:24 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp: Redefined TAO_YY_BREAK as ACE_NOTREACHED
          (break;) and made sure it is used properly in the file.

Mon Apr 26 10:44:18 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
          Added helper method to register the default factory with the
          service configurator. This is needed on NT where the
          export/import madness does no allow us to use the static service
          declaration from outside the DLL.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs_static.dsp:
          Added the new Event Channel files.

Mon Apr 26 09:16:51 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Driver.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Driver.i:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Driver.cpp:
          Encapsulated throughput measurements in a helper class.
          Added support for accumulating several latency measurements.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier_Driver.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
          Added support for accumulated throughput and per-consumer
          latency.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.cpp:
          Fine tuned.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set.cpp:
          We should not raise an exception when removing a supplier,
          because we would need to filter out supplier removal too. It is
          enough to raise the exception from the SupplierAdmin module.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.cpp:
          Added debugging messages (currently commented out).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.cpp:
          Added some @@ comments.

Mon Apr 26 05:35:12 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.{h,cpp}: Changed *_args to of type const char
          *.  Thanks to Andy for reporting this.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.{i,cpp} (default_svc_conf_entries): Moved to
          .cpp file and remove TAO_Internal.i from repository.

Sun Apr 25 16:59:59 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp: Added ACE_NOTREACHED to two redundant
          break statements.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_expression.cpp (coerce_value): Removed a
          redundant return statement.

Sun Apr 25 16:05:19 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.h:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp:
          The EC_Factories create a Supplier_Filter_Builder now. This
          simplifies some of the memory managment in the system: now the
          EC must handle the builder and the builder handles the object it
          creates.  I was able to lift a restriction of the factories
          implemented so far: they can be used from multile ECs now.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Supplier_Filter_Builder.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Supplier_Filter_Builder.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Supplier_Filter_Builder.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
          The EC_Factory creates a factory object for the supplier-side
          filters. Analogous to the consumer-side filter builder.
          The ProxyPushConsumer uses this object to create its filter, but
          the creation is deferred until the user connects to the
          ProxyConsumer (as it is done in the consumer side).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Trivial_Supplier_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Trivial_Supplier_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Trivial_Supplier_Filter.cpp:
          Moved the trivial supplier-side filter to its own filter. Added
          a builder for it.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierAdmin.cpp:
          Fixed some problems with late registration of
          suppliers/consumers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.cpp:
          Fixed several bugs during consumer/supplier match. Also added a
          supplier filter builder for this type.
          The EC_Default_Factory has support for it too.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter_Builder.h:
          Fixed comments.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
          Use the new EC by default.
          Start the threads at the right priority.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ec.conf:
          Enabled the per-supplier filters by default.

        * Updated many makefiles.

Sat Apr 24 22:57:42 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
          Fixed a typo that was causing a derived interface's
          _set_xxx_skel method to call the base class'
          _get_xxx_skel method. Thanks to Kris Johnson
          <kjohnson@gardnersys.com> for pointing this out.

Sat Apr 24 08:51:11 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.cpp:
          IRIX required an extra #include

Sat Apr 24 07:21:24 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Global.cpp (get_high_priority):
          on VxWorks, fixed access of default_priority.  It's in the
          Globals singleton.

Fri Apr 23 18:11:42 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
          Modified file_string_to_object() to use ACE::fopen
          instead of ACE::open. Formerly it was crashing when
          called from the MSVC debugger, due to a recent change
          made to plug a memory leak. This change (suggested by
          Carlos) will not support cool filename-within-file
          recursive behavior (past the file descriptor limit), but
          has the advantage of working with NT and causing no
          leaks on Unix.

Fri Apr 23 16:09:41 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs_static.dsp:
          Added EC_Default_Factory to the project files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp:
          Added include file that is required on NT, but not on Unix,
          beats me.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.{h,cpp}:
          use ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_DEF instead of ACE_THR_PRI_FIFO_DEF,
          and THR_NEW_LWP instead of THR_BOUND, if not using FIFO scheduling.
          Thanks to David H. Whittington <david.h.whittington@boeing.com>
          for testing these changes on HP/UX (where we're still not
          successful) and Irix (where we are successful), not running
          as root.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          Cleaned up EC_Event_Channel initialization: now it takes the POA
          for the consumer and suppliers in the constructor instead of
          using the factory.  This is was required since not all factories
          can be initialized with the right POAs.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/svc.conf:
          This test also uses the default factory now.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.cpp:
          The factory is a service object now.
          Some factories will require the user to set the POA objects.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Default_Factory.cpp:
          Added new EC_Factory that uses the command line arguments to
          control which strategies and objects are created, it is not very
          efficient, but is very useful for experimentation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp:
          Added new methods to set the POAs in the factory, they should be
          used for factories that require them.
          Added support for controlling ownership of the factory
          class.
          If the user does not specify any factories explicitly we try to
          dynamically load the abstract factory. If that fails we fall
          back of the EC_Default_Factory.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
          The proxy was not reporting its destruction to the EC, thus it
          wasn't removed from all the data structures.

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/svc.conf:
          The new Event Service is configured using the EC_Default_Factory
          and the svc.conf file.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ec.conf:
          Added support for the new "dynamically loadable"
          EC_Default_Factory.
          The ec.conf file contains the proper configuration for this
          test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.cpp:
          Added option to disable EC shutdown on program exit.

          Minor fixes in debugging messages.

Fri Apr 23 000:39:51 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Marshal.{h,i}:
          TAO_Marshal_Any::deep_free() was a no-op! I just forced
          the Any's destructor call. This may not be portable, but
          the alternative would probably necessitate un-inlining
          the function. Time will tell. Anyway, this fixed memory
          leaks due to Anys containing Anys.
        * tao/append.cpp:
          TAO_Marshal_Any::append() was causing client side memory
          leaks due to unreleased typecodes. Also fixed some Any
          weirdness I noticed by chance in TAO_Marshal_Union.
        * tao/skip.cpp:
          TAO_Marshal_Any::skip() was causing server side memory
          leaks due to unreleased typecodes.

          Thanks to Frank Buschmann <Frank.Buschmann@mchp.siemens.de>
          for providing a tortuous Any test idea.

Thu Apr 22 20:18:58 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * man/man7/TAO.7:

          Moved `man/man1/TAO.1' to `man/man7/TAO.7' since TAO.1 doesn't
          describe a user program.  It seems to fit better in
          "Miscellaneous," i.e. man section 7.

        * man/man1/*:

          Updated to reflect move of TAO.1 to man/man7/TAO.7.

Thu Apr 22 17:24:27 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Cosmetic changes to ~TC_Private_State so I can read it.

Thu Apr 22 13:37:49 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * man/man1/tao_idl.1:

        * man/man1/TAO_CosEvent_Service.1:
        * man/man1/TAO_Event_Service.1:

        Started added man pages for TAO and TAO's ORB services.  There are
        still several more to complete.  Some of the ones listed above need
        to be revised.

Thu Apr 22 07:53:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Reference_Counted_Servant/Makefile:
          Fixed small compilation problems.

Wed Apr 21 22:15:43 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA: Phase three of the POA rearchitecturing is now
          complete.  This phase includes:

          - Addition of reference counting to servants.  This includes:

          (a) obeying reference counting protocol between the POA and the
              servant
          (b) addition of the ServantBase_var class to TAO
          (c) addition of the RefCountServantBase class to TAO
          (d) addition of reference counting hooks to the ServantBase
              class
          (e) addition of reference counting to active object map entries
              to help in counting the number of outstanding requests on
              the servant

          - Etherealization of servants has now been fixed.
            <remaining_activations> and <cleanup_in_progress> should both
            have correct values.

          - New methods were added that help in deactivating and cleaning
            up servants.  These methods are used by both the POA and the
            POA Manager.

          - New example was added. Reference_Counted_Servant shows how to
            use reference counted servants to automatically manage dynamic
            memory for servants.

          - Setting up of POA Current object id was only done with the
            RETAIN policy.  This has now been fixed such that it works
            properly for all policies.  Thanks to Steve Totten
            <totten_s@ociweb.com> for pointing this out.

Wed Apr 21 21:56:01 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Quoter/client.cpp (main): adding missing ,
          between arguments to activate ().

Wed Apr 21 19:11:00 1999 Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/NS_Resolve.java:
          New NS resolution method based on CORBA standard approach.
          Many thanks to Margaret Reitz <margaret@veritas.com> and
          Hans Ridder <ridder@veritas.com> for contributing these changes.

          examples/Simulator/Event_Supplier/{DualEC_Sup, Event_Sup,
                                             Logging_Sup}.dsp:
          Changes to use the new CORBA standard TimeBase.idl

Wed Apr 21 14:45:28 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
          Use Recursive_Mutexes for the Basic_Factory, otherwise we risk a
          dead-lock if the user decides to disconnect or push a new event
          that it finally reaches the same consumer.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
          Added new method push_to_consumer() to the ProxyPushSupplier
          implementation, this method is invoked by the dispatching module
          to really push the event. Its job is to verify that the consumer
          is not disconnected and/or suspended.
          The Dispatching module does not need to receive the consumer
          anymore.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Service_Constants.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event_Utilities.i:
          Added new macro for the ANY_SOURCE source id.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Generator.cpp:
          Timeout filters should not accept any events in the filter()
          methods.
          The Timeout generator passes the event directly to their
          push_nocopy() methods.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Fixed little problem with the Time -> ImplRepo dependency in
          TAO_ORBSVCS

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          Added compile-time support for the new Event Channel, just for
          experimentation purposes.

Wed Apr 21 11:06:57 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.{h,cpp},
          server.cpp,client.cpp:  factored out thread creation flags to
          Globals::thr_create_flags.  Only set THR_SCHED_FIFO flag if
          sched_fifo_init operation to set process FIFO scheduling succeeded.

Wed Apr 21 09:37:27 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/summarize:
          added 0 low-priority thread case to example usage.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/MT_Cubit_Test:
          added exit at end of trap statement, so that the script
          will die after catching a signal and cleaning up.

Wed Apr 21 09:25:16 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcall/MT_Client_Test/client.cpp (main),
          examples/Quoter/client.cpp (main),
          performance-tests/Cubit/COOL/MT_Cubit/client.cpp
            (do_priority_inversion_test):
          replaced ACE_SCHED_FIFO with THR_SCHED_FIFO in activate calls.
          Thanks to Carlos for finding this subtle error.

Wed Apr 21 09:12:20 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/server.cpp:
          The activate() function was called with the wrong flag,
          ACE_SCHED_FIFO was used, but THR_SCHED_FIFO is the Right
          Thing[tm]

Wed Apr 21 03:41:51 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.20 released.

Wed Apr 21 01:24:26 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_resource.cpp: Removed extra #pragma instantiates for
          TAO_Collocation_Table_Lock.

Wed Apr 21 00:56:21 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i_T.cpp
          (operator=): Added an empty implementation to stop MSVC from
          complaining.

Tue Apr 20 23:21:22 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Removed a superfluous duplication of an ACE_Message_Block
          in private_member_label(). This got rid of another memory
          leak associated with unions. In general, it's never necessary
          to duplicate a message block before calling the Any
          constructor that takes a message block or either of the
          Any::_tao_replace() functions. All of these duplicate the
          message block themselves.

Tue Apr 20 22:57:57 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/any_op_cs.cpp:
          <<= was causing a memory leak. Removed the ->clone ()
          from the message block being inserted into the Any.
          Tested both copying and non-copying versions of <<=,
          over the wire, with a dynamically allocated type inside
          the union. All worked ok, and the leak was gone.

Tue Apr 20 20:43:25 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i_T.h: Added a
        operator= declaration to avoid this being generated which leads to
        undefined operator= for the PropertyTypes member when linking orbsvcs.
        Thanks to Irfan Pyarali for the fix.

Tue Apr 20 20:27:48 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/*:  Added an options class for storing
          program options and also changed the repository class to not
          use the ACE Naming Context.  It doesn't have persistence now,
          but that will be added soon.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/*:  Changed to work with the above changes.

Tue Apr 20 17:31:28 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs: Performed copy editing on a bunch of documentation and
          added the new Interoperable Naming Service documentation to the
          main documentation page.

Tue Apr 20 15:24:00 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/MT_Client/orb_creation.dsp:
        * tests/MT_Client/MT_Client.dsp:
          New MSVC project file for orb_creation.

Tue Apr 20 15:18:35 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_ROOT/docs/INS.html: Added this page. It documents the
          InterOperable Naming Service.
        * TAO_ROOT/docs/releasenotes/index.html: Added a link to INS.html

Tue Apr 20 14:27:07 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
          Removed local variable discrim_size_with_pad, which is no
          longer being used.

Tue Apr 20 11:09:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Removed several memory leaks, including the ORB_Core itself: it
          wasn't destroyed when the last ORB reference went away.

        * tao/ORB.cpp:
          Fixed resource leak in file_string_to_object()

        * tao/default_resource.h:
        * tao/default_resource.i:
        * tao/default_resource.cpp:
          Merged the App_Allocated and Pre_Allocated classes into a single
          class, it is easier to control their lifetime and it didn't make
          sense to have two.

        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp:
          Fixed comment.

        * tests/MT_Client/client.global.conf:
        * tests/MT_Client/client.tss.conf:
          Use static services.

        * tests/MT_Client/orb_creation.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Client/server.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:
          Use the ACE macros to print out exceptions.

        * tao/MessagingC.cpp:
          Fixed warnings about unitialized variables.

        * tests/MT_Client/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies

        * tests/MT_Client/run_test.pl:
          Added support for the orb_creation test.

Tue Apr 20 02:47:32 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.cpp (test_exception): It was still
          using environment to throw exceptions.  Changed to use ACE_THROW.

        * tests/Param_Test/except.{h,cpp}: Differentiated results based on
          the exception received in that iteration so we can determine if
          the exception is the one the test is waiting.  Egcs on Linux
          seems to have trouble downcasting exceptions.

Mon Apr 19 22:17:28 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp
          (visit_interface): Removed access to input CDR since it is not
          used in this function.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

Mon Apr 19 20:17:02 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{h,i}:
          Changed the signature of the constructor for Any::to_object
          to reflect the change set out in issue 154 of the 1.3 RTF.
          This makes the caller responsible for disposing of the
          results of extracting to to_object, and allows the constructor
          to be passed an Object_var to facilitate this.
          Also had to add '#include Object.h' to keep sunc++ happy.

Mon Apr 19 17:09:14 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (start_servant):
          Arrgh!  There was a missing comma that caused the test to fail!
          Thanks to David H. Whittington <david.h.whittington@boeing.com>
          for reporting this.

Mon Apr 19 16:26:43 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
          Updated TAO_Marshal_Union::deep_free to use the
          Union class virtual functions. The old code was
          bumpint the void *data pointer along to point to
          the discriminator value, then to the member value.
          This wasn't working on NT where the first thing
          in the union class memory layout is the vptr. Also
          changed the use of value() to _tao_get_cdr() on
          the elements of the member label list. That
          wouldn't work on any platform because those Anys
          are all created with void *value = 0;

        * tao/decode.cpp,
        * tao/encode.cpp,
        * tao/skip.cpp:
          Changed the tk_enum case for the discriminator inside
          the TAO_Marshal_Union versions to use CORBA::ULong as
          was determined to be the correct mapping earlier today.
          Also finished implementing the tk_wchar cases, which
          Andy had marked TODO.

          Avoided annoying g++ warning about <auto_ptr> by explicitly
          making a temporary. Thanks to David for pointing this out.

Mon Apr 19 13:54:10 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/configurations.html: removed TAO_ORBSVCS limitation
          that said we don't check for the macro in the each of the
          orbsvcs and orbsvcs/tests subdirectories.  We do now.

Mon Apr 19 13:15:25 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA: Fixed POA code to pass and use the environment when
          calling _add_ref and _remove_ref on servants.

        * tao/Servant_Base (_add_ref and _remove_ref): Added default
          environment parameter to call.  Thanks to David for pointing
          this out.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (resolve_root_poa and resolve_poa_current): Now that
          resolve_initial_references takes a environment, we don't need to
          create temporary environments.  Changed these functions to take
          the environment as a parameter.  Thanks to Carlos for pointing
          this out.

        * tao/POA: The following changes were made to comply with the new
          servant reference counting schemes in the upcoming CORBA 2.3
          specification:

          - Changed type of <default_servant_> from Servant to
            ServantBase_var.  This will help in (a) calling _remove_ref()
            on <default_servant_> when it is replaced with a new
            <default_servant_> and (b) calling _remove_ref() on
            <default_servant_> when the POA goes away.

          - Added servant reference counting to the following methods:

            get_servant
            set_servant
            activate_object
            activate_object_with_id
            servant_to_id
            servant_to_reference
            reference_to_servant
            id_to_servant

          - To be done: Calling _remove_ref() on deactivation of objects,
            deactivation of POAs, and destruction of POAs.

Sun Apr 18 12:32:15 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp (DRV_parse_args): Added check of
          validity of temp directory.  If tao_idl can't access the temp
          directory, spit out some warning and switch to use current
          directory.

Sun Apr 18 09:08:13 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: removed ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX, u_int>
          explicit template instantiation.  It duplicated the one
          in Servant_Base.cpp.

Sun Apr 18 03:34:33 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Servant_Base.h (class ServantBase_var): Added reference
          counting servant auto pointer class (as per CORBA spec).

        * tao/Servant_Base (class RefCountServantBase): Added reference
          counted mix-in class (as per CORBA spec).

        * tao/Servant_Base.cpp (operator= and TAO_ServantBase):

          - Fixed the copy constructor and assignment operator to copy the
            optable pointer from the <rhs> object.

          - Made the assignment operator protected (as per CORBA spec).

          - Also added _remove_ref() and _add_ref() (as per CORBA spec).

        * tao/Servant_Base.h (TAO_ServantBase): Made _is_a public and add
          _non_existent.

        * tao/Object.cpp (_non_existent): Added collocation optimization
          similar to the ones in _is_a().

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/collocated_ss.cpp
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/collocated_sh.cpp
          (visit_interface): Removed the generation of the _is_a from the
          collocated class since there is already a call to the servant
          from the object if the object is collocated.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp
          (visit_interface): Removed the incorrect comment that said that
          CORBA_Object::_is_a is a remote call.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp
          (visit_interface): Changed the _is_a skeleton to use compiled
          marshaling.  Also, changed the _non_existent skeleton to use
          compiled marshaling and to call the servant instead of simply
          returning false.

        * tao/Sequence.cpp (operator==): Moved the comparison of octet
          sequences from Stub.cpp to Sequence.cpp.  Also, removed the
          comparison of object keys.

          Fixed g++ warnings/errors. Thanks to David Levine and JM Strauss
          for reporting this.

Fri Apr 16 21:57:15 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/{bank,echo,grid,time}/Makefile:
          only build if the orbsvcs library was built with
          the Naming TAO_ORBSVCS component.

Fri Apr 16 19:40:27 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Okay, here goes. A recent bug report concerning crashes
          upon exit after inserting a union into an Any led to this
          discovery. When the Any goes away, it calls free_value()
          on the union (since it owns it). This leads eventually to
          TAO_Marshal_Union::deep_free(). The union wants to free
          its contents, so it goes to its own typecode's
          private_member_label() to find out which case is active.
          The private_state member_label_list is not constructed
          until a member_label is asked for, so one is often constructed
          at this point. It is an array of Any_ptrs, and each Any
          is constructed on the heap from an output CDR stream
          which is formed from a message block read from an input
          CDR stream formed from the typecode's buffer_. So far so
          good? The output CDR stream was constructed using the
          default ORB allocators. Then, when the typecode's destructor
          is called, it wants to free the member_label_list, which means
          freeing the Any(s), which means freeing their message blocks,
          which means freeing their data blocks. But by this time, the
          ORB has gone away, so the data block(s) are hanging, and we
          crash. The solution is to construct the output CDR with
          specified allocators, namely ACE_Allocator::instance (). This
          class seems to have been designed especially for problems like
          this, since it hangs around longer than anybody. As far as I
          can tell, there are no more instances in Typecode where a CDR
          stream hangs around, so this should be the only place where
          this fix is needed (but a better one will come along someday).
          Thanks to Irfan for mucho help with this and to Frank Buschmann
          <frank.buschmann@mchp.siemens.de> for reporting the problem.

Fri Apr 16 19:02:07 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp: Fixed a few warnings in g++
          and also added TAO_McastConfigIf and TAO_Negotiator class declarations.

Fri Apr 16 16:39:22 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect: Added a new connection handling strategy that
          simply blocks in recv() when waiting for a response from the
          server instead of waiting in the Reactor.  This strategy only
          works when the application does not have to worry about new
          requests showing up when waiting for a response. Therefore, this
          strategy is appropriate only for "pure" clients.

          Note that applications with nested upcalls are not "pure"
          clients. Also note that this strategy will only effect two way
          calls, since there is no waiting for one way calls.

          This strategy can also be used in an application that is both a
          client and a server, if the server side is handled by a separate
          thread and the client threads are "pure" clients.

          Carlos has promised to add policies that will make the selection
          of these connection handling policies finer grain than the "all
          or nothing" selection that currently exists.  The aim would be
          to allow some clients (maybe invocations) to use one connection
          handling policy and while others to use other policies.

          If applications can use this strategy, they can improve their
          performance since the Reactor will not get involved in this code
          path.

          Descriptive comparison of the different connection handling
          strategies is available in:
          http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/docs/Options.html

          Here are some numbers that compare the effect of different
          policies on the performance of a simple two way call:

          Policy                                            Performance        Speedup percentage
                                                            (calls/second)     (relative to MT)
          ------                                            -----------        ----------------

          MT Connection Handler (with a Reactor lock)          4346                 0.0
          ST Connection Handler (with a Reactor lock)          4416                 1.6
          ST Connection Handler (without a Reactor lock)       4473                 2.9
          RW Connection Handler                                4676                 7.6

          The above numbers were obtained from the
          examples/POA/Generic_Servant/client and
          examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/server examples (with the other
          usual optimizations turned on) using the following configuration
          in loopback mode:

          MSVC 6.0, release mode, NT4.0 SP 3, on a quad CPU Zeon (400 MHz)

          Added the new RW connection handling option to these tests.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static: Removed
          this file is it was now identical to the svc.conf file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          Added a visit_typedef() method to
          be_visitor_cdr_op_field_decl, so that we can
          generate cdr operations for typedef'd members
          of structs as well as anonymous ones. Previously,
          cdr operation code for this type of struct member
          would just be missing. Thanks to Torsten Kuepper
          <kuepper2@uni-wuppertal.de> for pointing out the
          problem and suggesting a fix.

Fri Apr 16 09:36:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_resource.cpp: removed ACE_*Guard instantiation
          pragmas.  There were no corresponding template class
          instantiation directives, and the pragmas duplicated those
          in ORB_Core.cpp.

        * tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:
          Minor cosmetic fix.

        * tao/default_resource.cpp:
          Re-order the destruction of objects in the
          TAO_App_Allocated_Resources class, otherwise we get seg faults

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/Environment.cpp:
          Fixed initialization problem, to query the default environment
          we don't need the ORB_Core, only its TSS resources, this allow

          Each ORB creates its own ORB_Core.  The ORB_Core is no longer a
          TSS singleton, instead it keeps some of its resources in TSS

Wed Apr 14 20:38:51 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/PolicyC.cpp: Added missing template instantiations.  Thanks
          to Robert V. Head <rhead@virtc.com> for reporting them.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp: Added missing instantiation
          for TAO_PropertySet<POA_AVStreams::StreamEndPoint>.

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp: Removed trailing semi-colon from #pragma
          instantiate.

Wed Apr 14 16:43:32 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          One of the strings removed in ORB_Core::init() was not
          duplicated first.

Wed Apr 14 15:33:35 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Endpoint_Strategy_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Endpoint_Strategy.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp:
          Replaced all uses of TAO_TRY macros with ACE_TRY macros.

Wed Apr 14 15:25:53 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_visitor_sequnce/gen_object_manager_ch.cpp
        * TAO_IDL/be_visitor_sequnce/gen_object_manager_ci.cpp
        Added a new -> operator and also removed a 'const' signature
        for the .in method in TAO_Object_Manager_{Name}_Sequence classes
        that are generated by the IDL compiler. This has been in TAO
        for sometime now..
        ---------------------------------------------
        tao/Sequence_T.i (operator->): Added operator-> to
          TAO_Object_Manager.  Also, made the in() method return a
          non-const pointer
        -------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 14 13:01:13 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp: Fixed template instantiation
        errors. Thanks to Andy Gokhale for reporting this.

Wed Apr 14 07:06:11 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp:
          fixed semicolons at ends of explicit template
          instantiations.

Wed Apr 14 00:24:42 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp: Added missing template instantiations.
          Thanks to Robert V. Head <rhead@virtc.com> for reporting them.

Tue Apr 13 17:02:39 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          auto_ptr<> requires an explicit constructor, thanks to David and
          the green hills compiler for detecting this.

Tue Apr 13 13:59:32 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp:
          Added inlcudes and macros to send output to a file, as
          the tests in ACE_wrappers/tests do. The macros are
          commented out, so the cubit tests will work exactly
          the same as before unless client.cpp and server.cpp are
          built with those macros uncommented. Especially useful
          for dealing with timeprobes, where there might be
          hundreds of entries in the output

Tue Apr 13 12:35:18 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.h:
        * tao/Connect.cpp:
          The MT_Client_Connection handler was using ORB_Core_instance()
          all over the place. Now it uses the ORB_Core provided in the
          send_request call.
          We will need to revisit this class, right now it allocates one
          condition variable per-connection, but allocating one on a
          per-thread (many per-thread-per-ORB) basis should be enough.
          We are also careful to use the ORB_Core's reactor to send the
          request and to implement the leader-follower model.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Changed bunch of calls to TAO_ORB_Core_instance() in an ORB_Core
          method, using <this> is enough in that case.

        * tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Client/server.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Client/test_i.cpp:
        * tests/MT_Client/server.conf:
        * tests/MT_Client/client.tss.conf:
        * tests/MT_Client/client.global.conf:
        * tests/MT_Client/run_test.pl:
          Added configuration files for the client, it can use TSS storage
          now. Also added some (optional) debugging information to monitor
          the client progress.
          The script supports this new features too.
          Simplified the server configuration file.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf.dynamic:
          We can use TSS allocators in this examples.

Tue Apr 13 09:52:20 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Concurrency_Service/Makefile,

          orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/Logger/Makefile,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/Makefile: added BIN2 support,
          for make realclean.

Mon Apr 12 22:12:27 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        Removed the resolve_commandline_ref (). This was no longer
        being used. Also passed ACE_TRY_ENV as a parameter to the
        following functions. Carlos suggested these changes :

        resolve_service ()
        multicast_to_service ()
        resolve_trading_service ()

        * tao/ORB.h
        * tao/ORB.cpp

Mon Apr 12 17:13:37 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Added the AVStreams_i_T.{h,cpp} and
          CosPropertyService_i_T.{h,cpp} to the project file.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/AV_benchmark.dsw:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/av_benchmark_client.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/av_benchmark_server.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/av_benchmark_child.dsp:
                Added the NT VC++ project files and worspace files.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/client.cpp:
                Fixed the compilation errors on NT.
                Works fine on Unix platforms.
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/benchmark/child_process.cpp:
          Added the new file which has just the main() for the child
          process. Thanks to David Hooker <DHooker@uniview.net> for
          reporting the errors.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i_T.{h,cpp}: Moved the
        TAO_StreamEndpoint classes from AVStreams_i.{h,cpp} as it was made
        a template to avoid interface inheritance errors on NT VC++.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i_T.{h,cpp}: Moved the
        TAO_PropertySet classes from AVStreams_i.{h,cpp} as it was made
        a template to avoid interface inheritance errors on NT VC++.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Added the new AVStreams_i_T.{h,cpp}
        and CosPropertyService_i_T.{h,cpp}.

Mon Apr 12 14:24:12 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: The resolve_policy_manager() and
          resolve_policy_current() only worked if TAO_HAS_CORBA_MESSAGING
          was defined.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/Stub.cpp: More problems if TAO_HAS_CORBA_MESSAGING is not
          defined.

Mon Apr 12 14:19:45 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * LifeCycle_Service/Makefile,tests/Property/Makefile,
          Trading_Service/Makefile,tests/Trading/Makefile: only build if
          the orbsvcs library was built with the necessary component.

        * Time_Service/Makefile,tests/Time/Makefile: added BIN2 support,
          for make realclean.

Mon Apr 12 14:09:06 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Operation_Table.h,
        * tao/Servant_Base.cpp,
        * tao/Server_Request.cpp,
        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp: Committed again the changes related to
          Removing strlen calculation for the Operation Name from the
          critical path. Length as it is obtained during demarshalling is
          stored in the IIOP_Request object and passed to the Perfect
          Hash's find operation. ACE_CString is used to store the
          operation as opposed char *. Thanks to Irfan for suggesting this
          change.

Mon Apr 12 13:41:23 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Timeprobe.h,
        * tao/Connect.cpp,
        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
          Added four new timeprobes to measure client outgoing process
          time and server process time. Whereas the pluggable protocols
          timeprobes were a subset of the regular timeprobes, these are a
          disjoint set. If both the pluggable and minimal timeprobes
          macros are uncommented in Timeprobe.h, pluggable will override.

Mon Apr 12 12:37:39 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiations.

Mon Apr 12 10:38:46 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MessagingC.cpp:
        * tao/PolicyC.cpp:
          Removed warnings about unused variables, the variables are
          required for platforms without native C++ exceptions.

        * docs/Options.html:
          Fixed description of the ORBinputcdrallocator option.

Mon Apr 12 09:52:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile:
          Keep working on the CORBA Messaging framework.

        * tao/orbconf.h:
        * tao/ORB.h:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
          Added support for "PolicyCurrent" and "ORBPolicyManager" into
          resolve_initial_references()

        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.i:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Added methods to set and query the TSS PolicyCurrent and the
          per-ORB PolicyManager.

        * tao/Object.h:
        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Implemented the standard methods to access and query policies,
          but they just delegate on the TAO_Stub methods.

        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Added methods to set and query the policies.

        * tao/Policy_Manager.h:
        * tao/Policy_Manager.i:
        * tao/Policy_Manager.cpp:
          Simple implementation of the CORBA::PolicyManager and
          CORBA::PolicyCurrent interfaces. There is a helper class shared
          between both implementations that is also used by the
          corresponding methods in CORBA::Object (and TAO_Stub).

        * tao/MessagingC.cpp:
          Added missing template instantiation

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile:
        * examples/Event_Comm/Makefile:

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile:
        * performance-tests/Pluggable/Makefile:
        * performance-tests/Thruput/TAO/Makefile:
          Removed extra rules to compile .idl files, they were giving me
          headaches when running parallel compiles.

          error on SunCC 5.0 when casting to void* from non-void pointer.
          Thanks to Darren Whobrey <whobrey@fecit.co.uk> for reporting
          this bug.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Persistent_Context_Index_T.cpp
          Changed the use of the <index> variable name to <context_index>
          to avoid conflict with the macro of the same name.

Sun Apr 11 18:29:47 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp (TAO_Naming_Client):
          Fixed the use of ACE_Thread_Mutex to ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX to ensure
          this will run properly on non-threaded platforms.  Thanks to
          Alex for reporting this.

Sun Apr 11 15:36:33 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp

Sat Apr 10 16:22:59 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * doc/papers/COOTS-99/poa.tex (): Made the Nos. in the table
          consistent with the figure.

Sat Apr 10 14:26:48 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp: Removed #POA_NO_TIMESTAMP according to Irfan's
          suggestion to get things to work on Soalris.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp :
        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp :

        Reverted the earlier changes related to saving strlen calculation
        on the critical path.

Fri Apr  9 17:49:25 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.h:
        * tao/Server_Request.i:
          Removed extra <const> in return type. The return was by-value,
          no sense in putting const in that case. Further, some compilers
          bark when you do so.

Fri Apr  9 17:14:09 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU:
          Fixed typos in the alternative extensions for generated files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/README:
          Added a short blurb about persistent Naming Service

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Persistent_Context_Index_T.cpp: Removed
          the use of nested typedefs, as this was breaking old g++
          compiler.  Surrounded Debug statements by <if>.  Added a return
          statement to avoid warnings.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/README: Added description of persistence
          command-line option.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.{h,cpp}: Changed the order
          of arguments in <init> method and constructor, to avoid breaking
          old code with the addition of the new parameter.

Fri Apr 09 16:19:12 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp (create_object_key and parse_key): We must include
          the persistent bit even when the POA_NO_TIMESTAMP is defined.
          Otherwise, we won't know which POA map to search. Thanks to Russ
          Noseworthy for reporting this.

Fri Apr  9 15:20:10 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

          strlen calculation for the Operation Name from the critical
          path. Length as it is obtained during demarshalling is stored in
          the IIOP_Request object and passed to the Perfect Hash's find
          operation.

Fri Apr 09 12:52:24 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp (_is_a): Removed
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG(named_value_1) since named_value_1 was removed.

Fri Apr  9 14:29:42 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{h,cpp}: Changed the argument of the static dump()
          function from const value to const reference. Thanks to Ulf
          Jaehrig <jaehrig@desys.com> for suggesting this.

Fri Apr  9 13:28:06 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Time_Service_{Server,Clerk}.dsp

Fri Apr  9 11:30:37 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp:
        * tao/default_client.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Removed ACE_STATIC_SVC_REQUIRE.

          Checked these files into the CVS repository.  These files are
          part of the TAO+auto{conf,make}/libtool integration work.  There
          are still some missing files and some of the above files need to
          be modified before they will work.  I just wanted to get these
          files under CVS control so that I can easily recover from a
          mishap or for some reason beyond my control.

Wed Apr 07 14:34:31 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp (_is_a): Removed unused
          variable.

        * examples/POA/Loader/Servant_Activator.cpp (ServantActivator_i):
        * examples/POA/Loader/Servant_Locator.cpp (ServantLocator_i):
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Manager.cpp
          (obtain_servant): Should use a simple cast for casting functions
          and not reinterpret_cast.

        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Manager.cpp
          (parse_string): Fixed comparison between signed and unsigned;
          <index> should be signed.

Wed Apr  7 14:05:09 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Hash_Naming_Context.{h,cpp}
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Context.{h, cpp}
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.{h,cpp}
          Updated to use new exceptions macros.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.{h,cpp}
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Added the files above, to implement
          persistent naming service.  The first version of persistent
          naming service is available.  It uses memory-mapped file to
          store the persistent state of the naming service.  When starting
          the Naming Service from orbsvcs/Naming_Service, if -f
          <file_name> option is provided, the persistent implementation is
          used, if no -f option is provided, an non-persistent
          implementation is used.

          We'll be adding comments/documentation for the above shortly.
          The class structure for the persistent implementation will also
          change in the near future, as I'll be merging some of
          persistent/non-persistent classes.

Wed Apr 07 14:11:19 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TimeBaseS_T.i: Started work on the Messaging spec policy
          framework. I added new modules (such as Messaging, TimeBase and
          IOP) and extended others to include more features (such as
          Policy).  Right now the modules are not compiled by default, I
          want to test the changes in more platforms before moving on.
          Also added support for more system exceptions and left some
          place holders for the Poller and Handler objects that are part
          of the AMI support.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_lookup.cpp:

          changed things so the code is actually defined in
          $TAO_ROOT/tao/TimeBase.pidl because the ORB needs those types.
          Many dependencies where updated to match this.

          and friends, use the ACE_*_MAX constants instead.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp: T::_narrow()
          can use T::_unchecked_narrow() to complete its job.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: The generated operation table is

        * orbscvs/tests/AVStreams/sfp/Makefile: only build if the orbsvcs
          library was built with the AV TAO_ORBSVCS component.  And,

Wed Apr 07 01:02:31 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp (parse_key and create_object_key): Improved the
          parsing of object keys belonging to the RootPOA.  Since this is
          the default POA and is commonly used, we have given it a
          reserved byte in the object key in order to quickly identify
          it. With the reserved bit, the active demux key for the RootPOA
          is not used, and no map lookups are required.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Service_Type_Repository.h
          (ServiceTypeRepository): Used Service_Type_Map_Iterator instead
          of Service_Type_Map::iterator.  Stupid g++ could not gork it.

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): Removed parsing for
          POAManager lock since it is no longer supported.

        * tao/Object_Adapter.cpp: Added missing template instantiations
          for ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex_Adapter and ACE_Map_Manager_Adapter.
          Thanks to Carlos for pointing this out.

        * tao/POA.cpp (create_object_key and parse_key): Fixed the use of
          ACE_NTOHL and ACE_HTONL.  Thanks to David for helping here.

        * tao/POA (Current): The object id information in the POA Current
          was broken since it kept the system id instead of the user
          id. The fix was to modify the Active_Object_Map to always
          recover the user id. Thanks to Steve Totten
          <totten_s@ociweb.com> for pointing this out.

Wed Apr  7 01:10:55 1999  Darrell Brunsch  <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu

          data length (CORBA::Short).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp (handle_input()): Used
          ACE_NTOHS on the received CORBA::Short.

Tue Apr 06 16:29:58 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init): Some how, calling to init_orb_globals()
          got moved before ORB Core initialization.  This must come AFTER
          the initialization of ORB Core.  Otherwise, all hell breaks
          loose.

          orbsvcs/Time_Service/clerk.cpp  -> Time_Service_Clerk.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Makefile: Changed the Makefile to reflect
          the above changes.

Tue Apr 06 15:33:34 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * all orbscvs/tests/AVStreams Makefiles: only build if the orbsvcs
          library was built with the AV TAO_ORBSVCS component.

Tue Apr 06 05:04:51 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp: Phase two of the new POA design is complete.

          - We now have support for active demuxing of POAs. For transient
            POAs, we directly use an active demuxing key in the object key
            since transient POAs cannot be reactivated.  For persistent
            POAs, we have added a active demux hint field in the object
            key.  This hint is in addition to the persistent POA name.

          - Transient POAs identifiers in the object key are of fixed
            size. For persistent POAs, the object key contains a number
            that specifies how long the POA name is.  This feature speeds
            up things since there is no need for sequential, byte by byte
            searching for field separators.

          - The use of the active demux hint for the POA name in the
            object key is optional.  If used, the lookups are faster
            (unless the hint is invalidated by a deactivation or by
            restarting a persistent POA).  However, using the hint results
            in a larger IOR, and more memory being used in the active
            object map.  This option can be controlled through the
            -ORBactivehintinpoanames runtime switch and is turned on by
            default.

          - The POA related classes have been rewritten with respect to
            exceptions.  Memory management in case of exceptions from
            servants and in case of dynamic memory / constructor failures
            have been greatly improved through the use of auto pointers
            and the new ACE_NEW_THROW_EX macro.  One of the problems
            related to exceptions was that the POA Current was not reset
            properly.  This has also been fixed.

          - New file Object_Adapter contains an abstraction for all the
            POAs in the ORB.  This class is used to hold the Object
            Adapter lock and the tables for the POAs in the ORB.  The
            point of contact for dispatching requests and finding servants
            has changed from the RootPOA to the Object Adapter.  The file
            also contains classes to iterate through a folded POA name.

          - New file Key_Adapters contains the common classes used by the
            Object_Adapter class and the Active_Object_Map class.  These
            common classes are usually used for similar maps such as the
            ACE_Active_Map_Manager_Adapter and
            ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex_Adapter.

          - POA name separator was changed from '/' to '\0'.  Since POA
            names are strings, this makes a better choice since there is
            no chance of a conflict with the string specified by the
            user.

          - The POA name separator change also led to the removal of the
            TAO specific extension which allowed users to specify a nested
            POA name in find_POA() and create_POA().  The
            Explicit_Activation, FindPOA, and NewPOA examples were changed
            not to use the above TAO extention.

          - Fixed RootPOA example to remove extra exception code left
            there by Bala.

          - Collocation table now maps addresses to Object Adapters
            instead to the Root POAs.

          - POA objects and POA Manager objects now contain a reference to
            lock rather than a lock instance.  The lock comes from the
            Object Adapter.  This change was made to centralize the
            locking and reduce the number of locks grabbed during request
            dispatching.

          - Added ids for POA policies.

        * tao/Active_Object_Map.cpp:

          - Fixed the calculation of <system_id_size>.

          - Removed a memory leak by iterating over the entries left in
            the user id map and deleting the dynamically allocated
            <Map_Entry>s.

          - Made sure that the user can specify the map sizes if desired.

        * tao/Connect.cpp (handle_message): Reduced the number of calls
          made to access the object_key and its buffer.

        * tao/Object_KeyC.h: Added operator!= for Object Keys.

        * tao/poa_macros.h (TAO_POA_GUARD_RETURN and TAO_POA_GUARD): Added
          new macros.

        * examples/POA/Adapter_Activator/: Added new example to test the
          dynamic creation of POAs when dispatching requests.  The
          original POAs are deleted once the object references have been
          created. After this, an adapter activator is install in the
          RootPOA to reactivate the POAs on demand.

Tue Apr  6 02:40:31 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/Simple_util.cpp (init): We have to make sure we
          don't try to proceed if querying of naming service failed.
          Thanks to David Hauck <davidh@realtimeint.com> for reporting the
          bug.

Tue Apr 06 00:12:11 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp (_is_a): Added back the code
          that Bala had commented out.  I am not sure why Bala had
          commented this out, but without this code, the application does
          not work.

Mon Apr  5 21:34:05 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_expression.h:

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_constant.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_expression.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sunsoft.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp: We can now define constants (in
          .idl files) of type long long, unsigned long long and
          wchar. This has been made easier by the fact that the CORBA
          basic types are now defined in ACE. Still need more ACE/TAO
          support in order to do long double and wide strings, though. All
          the above builds cleanly on NT, sunc++, g++ and egcs.  A few
          simple examples work on NT - more testing to come.

Mon Apr  5 16:26:32 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp (handle_input): Fixed the
          handle_input () that handles the multicast to work for both
          Naming and Trading Service. Thanks to James CE Johnson
          <jcej@tragus.org> for reporting this.

Mon Apr 05 09:59:26 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile,docs/configurations.html: removed enabling of
          fakesvcconf with static libraries, so that we can use
          -ORBsvcconf with them.

        * tao/POA.cpp (create_object_key): don't declare local
          creation_time_length with POA_NO_TIMESTAMP, to avoid compiler
          warning.  Also, replaced two occurrences of
          TAO_Creation_Time::creation_time_length () with
          creation_time_length, to save the function call.

Mon Apr  5 02:06:57 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

Sun Apr 04 22:33:23 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static: updated
          comments to show -ORBsvcconf svc.conf.static option.

Sun Apr  4 14:15:12 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.cpp: Removed an extra semicolon from a chain of
          << stream insertions.

Sun Apr  4 04:50:00 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_init.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/tao_idl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: Moved the IDL_CFE_VERSION macro definition
          from Makefile to tao_idl.cpp.  It doesn't get changed anyway.
          Changed the version information generated by "tao_idl -V" to
          something more helpful.  This is what it looks like now:

          tao_idl
          FE: Base on Sun IDL CFE version 1.3.0
          TAO C++ BE, Version 0.3.17

        * examples/POA/Forwarding/run_test.pl: Changed to use
          ACE::waitforfile to ensure proper startup of servers and the
          client.  Also made sure the temporary ior files get removed
          after each test cycle so ACE::waitforfile works properly.

        * examples/POA/Forwarding/MyFooServant.cpp (forward): The prefix
          for I/R id has changed from 'IDL:' to 'IDL:omg.org/'.

        * tao/Forwarding_Servant.cpp (invoke): We do own the exception in
          Any.

Sun Apr  4 01:59:48 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/sfp/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/sfp/server.cpp: Added code to test the
          fragmentation/reassembly features using a -f option.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/sfp.h: Defined new classes for sfp
          fragmentation and reassembly.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/sfp.cpp: Removed the unnecessary connect on
          the ACE_SOCK_Dgram which prevented the code from working on
          Windows because calling sendto on a connected socket is wrong.
          Thanks to David Hooker <DHooker@uniview.net> for reporting this.

          Added code to do reassembly of fragmented SFP packets. The code
          is now cleaner as it uses the interpretive marshalling to
          marshal/demarshal sfp headers.

Sun Apr  4 00:33:20 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf{,.static}: updated
          ORB configuration to correspond to that of IDL_Cubit, except to
          use -ORBresources tss.  Thanks to Irfan for providing the
          configuration parameters.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp: Moved
          _duplicate() to the .cpp file again, this eliminates a pesky
          warning from the broken g++ 2.7.X compilers.

        * TAO/tao/default_client.{h,cpp}:
        * TAO/tao/default_server.{h,cpp}: TAO is now build with static
          services enabled.  You can use TAO components as either static
          or dynamic services (wrt. Service Configurator.)  There are many
          ways to set up the svc.conf entries.  All these are documented
          in

            http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/docs/configurations.html#programming

        * Changed all svc.conf file to use TAO components as static
          services.  A perl script call tao_svcconf.pl under
          $ACE_ROOT/bin/ can help you convert svc.conf files.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf.dynamic: Renamed
          svc.conf.static to svc.conf.dynamic as a sample svc.conf file
          that uses dynamic services.

Wed Mar 31 23:32:13 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Purified the INS changes in the following files. Also minimized
        data copying.

        * tao/IOR_LookupTable.cpp:
        * tao/IOR_LookupTable.h: Passed params by reference for the add ()
          and find ().
        * tao/Connect.cpp: Removed data copying.
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Changed the add_to_ior_table () to fix some memory
          leaks.
        * tao/ORB.cpp: Fixed memory leaks in resolve_initial_references ()
          and iioploc_string_to_object (). Changed the add/find IOR APIs
          to take params by reference for minimal copying.
        * tao/ORB.h: Changed the signatures of the add/find IOR APIs.

Wed Mar 31 14:09:51 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp: Made some cosmetic
          changes to the ACETRY macros defined inside.

Wed Mar 31 09:02:39 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.h:
        * tao/ORB_Core.i:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Moved the output CDR allocators from the
          ORB_Core into the resource factory.  Even though this resources
          can always be TSS the ORB_Core is not used is a single thread
          anymore.  Changes similar to this may be required as the
          ORB-thread relationship is decoupled.

Wed Mar 31 06:58:28 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_to_service): Fixed a couple mistakes in
          this function that were causing it to fail on errors.  Thanks to
          Mike Mazurek <mmazurek@std.saic.com> for reporting this.

Wed Mar 31 03:24:35 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAS.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/POAC.{h,i,cpp}: Brought these files in-synch with TAO_IDL
          generated files.  Major changes are: Use of namespace on
          platforms that support it.  Use of perfect-hash optable.  Use of
          compile marshalling.  Added _interface_repository_id accessors.
          Added _non_existent_skel for skeletons.  Repository ID changed
          to start with IDL:omg.org/.  Remote operation invocation now
          understand MP.  Use of ACE_TRY macros.

          Thanks to Jeff for the reminder.

Wed Mar 31 000:42:30 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.ll:
        * TAO_IDL/lex.yy.cpp: Added a definition above the rules section
          to generalize newline to handle '\n' and "\r\n", and plugged the
          definition in where appropriate in the rules section.  Since we
          don't regenerate lex.yy.cpp with every build, that had to be
          generated and checked in as well. Thanks to Ossama for his quick
          hack of a simple test for this.  Also tested by ftp of Ping.idl
          (in binary mode) from NT to Unix and rebuild of orbsvcs after
          removing generated Ping interface files.  Also, thanks to
          Andreas Geisler <andreas.geisler@erls.siemens.de> for reporting
          the problem.

Wed Mar 31 00:25:17 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECConsumer.cpp: fixed a bug in
          counting down the events received in the consumer's <push>
          method.

Wed Mar 31 00:14:53 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Default_Servant/File_i.cpp (destroy):
        * examples/POA/Default_Servant/server.cpp
        * examples/POA/Default_Servant/client.cpp

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp
          examples/POA/DSI/server.cpp
          examples/POA/DSI/client.cpp: MAde some cosmetic changes to the
          ACETRY macros defined inside

Tue Mar 30 18:30:27 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Added a paragraph describing the relation and
          useage of command-line options, environment variables, and
          svc.conf files.  Thanks to Don Busch <busch_d@ociweb.com> for
          pointing this out.

Tue Mar 30 12:33:06 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.16 released.

Tue Mar 30 11:16:57 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp
          (resolve_initial_references,iioploc_string_to_object): We don't
          need a char* array here.

Tue Mar 30 09:51:03 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Missing ORB_Core argument in the InputCDR for
          ior_string_to_object.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Improved error messages.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp: Use ACE_TRY macros to throw exceptions.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: We cannot cache the allocators because the
          ORB_Core_instance will not be TSS in the future.

        * tests/MT_Client/server.conf: Use global resources.

        * tests/MT_Client/client.cpp: Use ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION to print the
          exception.

Mon Mar 29 22:42:31 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp : Used CORBA::string_dup () in handle_message
          ().  Un-owned memory was being assigned to an auto-ptr, which
          caused the INS test to fail on NT.  Also added a check for
          TAO_debug_level.

        * tests/InterOp-Naming/InterOp_test.cpp (main): Removed some Debug
          statements.

Mon Mar 29 21:27:56 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO-INSTALL.html: removed 2>&1 from cross-compilation
          instructions.  Thanks to Jeff for reporting that t/csh doesn't
          like it.

Mon Mar 29 20:12:12 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Changed the ACE_TRY_ENV in ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION to ACE_ANY_EXCEPTION.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_TIO.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp

        * TAO/examples/Simple/time: Updated the following projects to
          contain Simple_util.* Removed the obsolete files. Thanks to
          Barry Hoggard <hoggard@cfx.com> for pointing this out.

          * TAO/examples/Simple/timeserver.dsp
          * TAO/examples/Simple/timeclient.dsp
          * TAO/examples/Simple/timeserver_static.dsp
          * TAO/examples/Simple/timeclient_static.dsp

        * TAO/examples/Simple/time: Updated the following projects to

          * TAO/examples/Simple/timeclient_static.dsp

Mon Mar 29 19:10:09 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.i:
        * tao/Stub.cpp: The Stub carries the ORB_Core around, this reduces
          the number of calls to TAO_ORB_Core_instance(), at least on the
          client-side.  It is also the first step to be able to get to the
          policy list effective for an object, because we needed some way
          to map from the CORBA::Object to the ORB that it belongs to.

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
        * tao/CDR.cpp: The InputCDR class can carry the ORB_Core around to
          initialize the TAO_Stub's appropiately. Unfortunately we cannot
          use this feature everywhere.

        * tao/Invocation.i: Initialize the InputCDR with the right
          ORB_Core.

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Changed the code to create TAO_Stub's to use the
          new constructor and pass it the ORB_Core.  Use the right
          ORB_Core when extracting an object reference from a string.

        * tao/Object.cpp: When extracting an Object from a CDR stream we
          use the right ORB_Core.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: Use the
          ORB_Core in the stub instead TAO_ORB_Core_instance() to make a
          request.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp: Migrated to the new
          TAO_Stub constructors.

Mon Mar 29 15:55:23 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.h (CORBA_Request): Put a default argument for calls
          send_oneway () and invoke () as
          CORBA::Environment::default_environment(). This is for users who
          are using the native exception. But users using the non-native
          exceptions should pass in their environment to get the exception
          back. This change is attributed to Barry Hoggard
          <hoggardb@cfx.xom>

Sun Mar 28 21:37:42 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/grid/Grid_Client_i.cpp (run): fixed typo in
          ACE_DECLARE_NEW_CORBA_ENV.

Sun Mar 28 18:28:10 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_i.cpp: Removed extra
          ACE_File_Connector variables that were not being used.

Sun Mar 28 17:55:10 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Replaced the TAO exception macros with ACE exception macros.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout):
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_TIO.cpp

Sun Mar 28 14:58:50 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/objref.cpp
        * tests/Param_Test/server.cpp
        Made cosmetic changes to these files.

Sun Mar 28 14:27:28 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Naming/Hash_Naming_Context.cpp: Replaced
           ACE_GRUAD_THROW* with ACE_GUARD_TRHOW_EX with appropriate
           ACE_CHECK*.

Sun Mar 28 14:20:25 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynAnyC.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/DynAny_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynArray_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynEnum_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynSequence_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynStruct_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynUnion_i.{h,cpp}: Changed over TAO_IN_ENV to ACE_TRY_ENV
          and ACE_NEW_THROW_RETURN to ACE_NEW_THROW_EX/ACE_CHECK_RETURN.
          Also replaced a few Any_ptr/delete pairs with Any_vars.

Sun Mar 28 11:39:36 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/AccountManager_i.cpp (open): Fixed a typo.

Sun Mar 28 07:40:45 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp: added
          ACE_Auto_Basic_Ptr<TAO_Naming_Context> explicit instantiation.

Sun Mar 28 03:27:59 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/ORB.cpp:
        * TAO/tao/Typecode.cpp: Replaced ACE_NEW_THROW* macros with
           ACE_NEW_THROW_EX and appropriate ACE_CHECK* macros.

1999-03-27  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated the A/V documentation.

Sat Mar 27 14:20:09 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Event_Comm/Consumer_Input_Handler.cpp,
          Notifier_Handler.cpp, Supplier_Input_Handler.cpp,
          notifier.cpp:
          Fixed compile warnings.

Sat Mar 27 11:57:11 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.h:
        * tao/ORB.cpp: Removed an Unbounded_Set<ACE_INET_Addr> that I
          moved from IIOP_ORB, but it was not used at all.

Sat Mar 27 06:51:38 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Event_Comm/Makefile: updated dependencies so that it
          can build.

Fri Mar 26 23:50:46 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.pidl (PortableServer): Added State and get_state.
          Thanks to Umar Syyid <usyyid@hns.com> for pointing this out.

Fri Mar 26 22:53:09 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.h:
        * tao/Context.h:
        * tao/DynAnyC.h:
        * tao/Environment.h:
        * tao/Exception.h:
        * tao/NVList.h:
        * tao/ORB.h:

        * tao/Principal.h:
        * tao/Request.h:
        * tao/Server_Request.h:
        * tao/TypeCode.h: Put in some more of the _ptr_type and _var_type
          typedefs. As I read in the Henning/Vinoski book, I see that
          these things are used just about anywhere xxx_ptr and/or xxx_var
          are defined. This should about do it for TAO code. Still some
          places in the IDL compiler left where these can be generated.

Fri Mar 26 21:57:44 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAManager.cpp (get_state): Made changes to the type
          declarations in this file. The scoping was not right to acces
          the enum variables. Thanks to Naga for pointing out the mistake.

Fri Mar 26 18:08:10 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp: Removed the IIOP_ORB.{h,cpp} from the
          project files.

Fri Mar 26 18:07:43 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAC.h:
        * tao/POAS.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/POAManager.{h,cpp} (get_state): Added enum definition for
          PortableServer::POAManager::State and the get_state method which
          got added in Corba 2.3 spec.  Thanks to Umar Syyid
          <usyyid@hns.com> for pointing this out.

Fri Mar 26 18:12:56 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_server_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_server_i.cpp: I think the passing
          of a _var into a method that accepts _ptr was causing errors on
          some platforms so I added .ionout () to it hoping to fix it.

Fri Mar 26 17:59:22 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/IR_Helper.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_client_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_i.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_server_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_server_i.h: Replaced all TAO
          exception macros with ACE exception macros.

Fri Mar 26 17:58:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile:

        * tao/ORB.h:
        * tao/ORB.i:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Removed the IIOP_ORB class, it was not needed,
          it was confusing the pluggable protocols work and it added more
          layering than was desirable.  Also added a pointer from the ORB
          to the ORB_Core that created it, that way we don't need to rely
          on the TAO_ORB_Core_instance() method.  The more I think about
          it the more the ORB_Core looks like an implementation class for
          the ORB interface.

        * examples/Makefile: Added Event_Comm to the list.

        * docs/releasenotes/TODO.html: Updated with the new tasks ahead.

Fri Mar 26 15:38:00 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp (handle_input): Cosmetic
          change. Moved the null termination of service name ahead so it
          prints properly in the ACE_DEBUG.

Fri Mar 26 16:00:58 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: instead of not building Time component
          if ImplRepo component isn't built, build ImplRepo component if
          Time component is built.

Fri Mar 26 13:01:50 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp: Modified
          code to use member environment variable inside cube_* calls, and
          ACE_TRY_ENV inside init and shutdown code.

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.dsp:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/collocation_test.dsp:
          Deleted a header file that was included twice and added a couple
          that were missing.

Fri Mar 26 12:51:07 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Context.{h, cpp}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Hash_Naming_Context.{h, cpp}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/README: Added the files above.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.{h, cpp}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Update the files above.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/CosNaming_i.{h, cpp}: Removed the files
          above.  Restructured the implementation of the Naming Service to
          follow the bridge pattern.  This will allow to easily plug
          additional implemenations of the Naming Service, as well as
          dynamically load the appropriate implementation at run-time with
          Service_Config.

          Please see orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/README for details.

Fri Mar 26 11:39:44 1999  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Generator.h: Replaced forward
          declaration of TAO_EC_Timeout_Filter with include
          EC_Timeout_Filter.h so static_cast knows the complete type.

        * utils/IOR-parser/Makefile: Now builds without a library; builds
          on HP-UX.

Fri Mar 26 09:26:48 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time_Utilities.*: replace static zero object
          with static zero () member function.  This removes the
          dependencies of all other services on TAO's Time Service.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp,
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp,
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp,

          orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp: changed
          ORBSVCS_Time::zero to ORBSVCS_Time::zero ().

Fri Mar 26 08:39:45 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp: Fixed minor syntax error in the
          be_helper.cpp file.

Fri Mar 26 01:33:05 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Updated the InterOperable Naming Service sections of the
        following:
        * docs/Options.html:
        * docs/releasenotes/#nservices:

Thu Mar 25 22:08:21 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.{h,cpp}: Changed TAO_TRY stuff to ACE_TRY;

Thu Mar 25 21:42:28 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp: Updated tao_idl's copyright message.

Thu Mar 25 21:11:11 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

          Changed TAO_TRY stuff to ACE_TRY.  Also re-enabled the
          cube_union test in DII_Cubit.

Thu Mar 25 20:26:40 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp : Fixed some memory leaks in
          resolve_initial_references (). Called resolve_service for
          service names other than those statically defined in the orb.
          The resolve_service was initially resolve_naming_service. Now it
          takes a string as a parameter for the service name to be
          resolved.

        * tao/ORB.h: Changed the function resolve_naming_service () to
          resolve_service passing in the service name as a parameter.
          This function calls multicast_to_service () with the given
          service name.

Thu Mar 25 16:34:55 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp: The TypeCode buffer generated
          for unions that had a short, ushort, char or wchar as
          discriminator was broken.  This was giving all kinds of problems
          with the new test in Param_Test
          (union inside any).  Hopefully it will fix the problem that
          Frank Buschmann <Frank.Buschmann@mchp.siemens.de> reported.

        * tao/Typecode.cpp: Changed one of the methods
          (private_member_label) to use the ACE_TRY macros and fixed
          several problems with its demarshaling of the labels.  Another
          attempt at fixing the problem with unions that was good, but no
          the right solution.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_union/any_op_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/any_op_cs.cpp: Added support for
          interpretive and compiled marshaling versions of the <<= and >>=
          operators for unions.  This was an attempt to fix a bug in
          marshaling unions inside anys, but finally the problem was in
          other place, the change is useful though, and I am leaving it as
          an example on how to start removing the need for the encode()
          and decode() operations, even in the support of the CORBA::Any
          type.

        * tao/Any.h:
        * tao/Any.cpp: Added new operations to manipulate CORBA::Any with
          compiled marshaling.

        * tests/Param_Test/any.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/any.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/client.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.cpp: Added new sub-test for the
          any test. It inserts a union into the any.

        * tao/encode.cpp: Simplified implementation of union marshaling.

        * tao/decode.cpp: Minor optimization in Any demarshaling.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Added @@ comment.

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Minor cosmetic fix.

Thu Mar 25 16:24:08 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/{MT_Cubit_Test,run_test.pl},
          performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/run_tests.pl: changed
          iioplite to gioplite.  See ChangeLogTag:Mon Mar 8 20:49:45 1999
          Carlos O'Ryan.

Thu Mar 25 15:09:37 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the following files for the InterOperable Naming Service
        test.
        * tests/InterOp-Naming/InterOp_test.cpp:
        * tests/InterOp-Naming/README:
        * tests/InterOp-Naming/Makefile:

Thu Mar 25 07:41:57 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp: Fixed use of ACE_NEW_RETURN,
          ACE_NEW was the right macro here.

Thu Mar 25 01:05:47 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/include/idl_global.h (class IDL_GlobalData):

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp: Removed the code that was
          resolving "TEMP" variable to figure out temp directory. Instead
          use the global temp_dir () which has already been resolved once
          in drv_args.cpp

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp (temp_dir):
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
          Added an option -t to specify temp directory for the IDL
          COMPILER. If this is not specified, it will be resolved from
          ACE_DEFAULT_TEMP_DIR_ENV environment variable. IF that is also
          not defined, /tmp/ will be used.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Fixed to use the temp directory to
          keep the gperf temp files.

          Thanks to Margaret Reitz <margaret@veritas.com> for reporting
          the problem.

Wed Mar 24 16:39:03 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Quoter/Quoter_i.cpp: Fixed a warning with copy ().

Wed Mar 24 15:07:22 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: Hardcoded our specialized yacc path in it (and
          it can be overridden via the command line).  Also automatically
          put an CVS ID string in the y.tab.cpp also.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp.diff:
        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp: Removed some warnings and updated the
          diff.

Wed Mar 24 10:04:28 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface_fwd/interface_fwd_ci.cpp:
          Removed definitions of inline functions for the T_var and T_out
          classes corresponding to a forward declaration. The classes will
          be generated again for the interface.  This change should let us
          use inline versions of T::_nil() and T::_duplicate().

Wed Mar 24 09:00:01 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp: This is the only file
          outside $TAO_ROOT/tao that was using STUB_Object.

Wed Mar 24 06:13:45 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (invoke_i): removed ACE_NOTREACHED wrapper
          from final return statement.  Both DU cxx and ghs complained
          that the statement is reachable, I think because the last switch
          statement doesn't have a default case.

Tue Mar 23 22:33:43 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.i:
        * tao/Stub.cpp: Changed the name from STUB_Object to TAO_Stub,
          otherwise it pollutes the namespace.  This affected many files.

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/Exception.h:
        * tao/Exception.cpp: Added new system exceptions: INV_POLICY
          (invalid policy), REBIND
          (request will require object rebind) and TIMEOUT (the request
          timed out).  This new exceptions are not raised yet, but they
          will be as part of the CORBA Messaging effort.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp: Changed all CORBA_DATA_CONVERSION
          exceptions for CORBA::MARSHAL. DATA_CONVERSION is reserved to
          errors while handling basic types, such as fixed<> or marshaling
          character sets.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/collocated_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/collocated_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: The IDL
          compiler generates TAO_Stub now.  Moved the generation of the
          _duplicate() and _nil() methods to the .i files.  We now
          generate the _unchecked_narrow() method.

Tue Mar 23 21:55:21 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU,orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile,docs/configurations.html:
          moved TAO_ORBSVCS default setting from rule.tao.GNU to
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile.

Tue Mar 23 21:36:12 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: The error codes returned from invoke_i()
          were wrong. Resulting in missing user exceptions and other evil
          things.

        * docs/Options.html:
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Added option to control TAO_debug_level
          directly.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Enabled more debugging messages for the beginning
          of an outgoing buffer, only if TAO_debug_level > 3.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp: Print some debugging
          messages if the tests fail.

Tue Mar 23 19:14:23 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/Simple_util.h (class Server): Added a method to
          test the InterOperable Naming Service with any of the existing
          Simple examples in TAO (like bank,time etc.)  Specifying a "-i
          object_id" option to the any of the examples will allow a client
          to use the multiple end-point iioploc ior for the server as
          iioploc:1.0//<host-name>:<port>/<object_id>,<other-endpoints>

          This change will be used by the InterOperable Naming Service
          test that will be added soon to the TAO\tests.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): Printed the error message in the
          accept call only if the TAO_debug_level > 0.

Tue Mar 23 10:14:58 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: There were some missing '\n' that
          were making the ACE_ERROR statements hard to read.

Tue Mar 23 09:27:51 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile: if not building ImplRepo Service, don't build
          Time Service.

        * ImplRepo_Service/Makefile,Time_Service/Makefile,
          tests/ImplRepo/Makefile,tests/Time/Makefile: only build if the
          orbsvcs library was built with the respective TAO_ORBSVCS
          component.

Tue Mar 23 09:01:01 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.h:
        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Fixed throw spec declarations.

Tue Mar 23 08:59:22 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp (do_static_call,do_dynamic_call): removed unused
          local variable "status".

Tue Mar 23 00:22:16 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.h:
        * tao/Invocation.i:
        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Stub.h:
        * tao/Stub.cpp: Major changes to the start() and invoke() methods,
          they now control most of the loop for connection establishment
          and forwarding. The clients only need to restart the request if
          the invoke method returns TAO_INVOKE_RESTART.  Also factored out
          the common code for several versions of the invoke() method.
          Fixed severe error in protocol implementation, a successful
          write followed by a read error must result in a COMM_FAILURE
          exception.  Carefully examined what exceptions and what status
          code to raise from start() and invoke().  Re-organized the
          implementation of do_static_call and do_dynamic_call to use the
          new features of the invocation classes.  Cleaned up the
          LocationRequest implementation.

        * tao/Pluggable.h:
        * tao/Pluggable.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Connector.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Connector.cpp: No exceptions are raised by the
          connector, simply an error code is returned.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: Changed the
          IDL compiler to exploit the new features in the Invocation
          classes.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Cleaned up error propagation.

        * tao/Environment.cpp:
        * tao/Connect.cpp: Minor cosmetic fixes.  Improved error messages
          format.

        * tao/Object.cpp: Reimplemented some methods using the new form of
          compiled marshaling.

Mon Mar 22 17:32:19 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp: Removed an extra ACE_DEBUG.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init): Added a TAO_CHECK_ENV.
          This came up while I was testing the InterOperable Naming
          Service on NT.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): removed the unused variable
          'result'. egcs was complaining for this.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Removed the #defs for IIOPNAME_PREFIX and
          IIOPLOC_PREFIX. I am not using these anywhere.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): Removed an unnecessary ACE_DEBUG.
          Moved the dgram.close () up.

Mon Mar 22 17:15:20 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/tao.dsp: Added IOR_LookupTable files.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp: Fixed a signed/unsigned warning and an error
          with an ambiguous use of [].

Mon Mar 22 16:40:36 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): Included
          "ace/OS.h". Used ACE_static_cast.

Mon Mar 22 16:40:36 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        The first version of the InterOperable Naming Service is commited.

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Changed the resolve_initial_references () to check
          for the ORB params ORBInitRef and ORBDefaultInitRef.

          resolve_initial_references ():
          The references are resolved in the following order :
          1. ORBInitRef 2. DefaultInitRef 3. Multicast to service.  The
          IORs can be specified in the iiopname or iioploc format.

          multicast_query ():
          Sends out a multicast to locate a service (specified by a
          service name) and receives the response using TCP instead of
          UDP. The service name and port are sent in the data of the
          multicast.

          multicast_to_service ():
          Calls multicast_query with a service name instead of a service
          ID.  Owns the memory read into in multicast_query ().

          resolve_naming_service (), resolve_trading_service ():
          Call multicast_to_service () with a service name instead of a
          service ID.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.h: Added the following APIs to the ORB to access the
          table of IORs TAO_IOR_LookupTable :
          _tao_add_to_IOR_table ()
          _tao_find_in_IOR_table ().

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp: Added the function iioploc_string_to_object().
          This function is called by the string_to_object () for iioploc
          IORs.  It creates a multiple profile stub object and then an
          object reference.  The string_to_object () parses the incoming
          ior to detect an iioploc IOR and then calls the
          iiooploc_ior_to_string (). Conversion for the iiopname type IORs
          will be added soon.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Added the options -ORBInitRef and
          -ORBDefaultInitRef.  Added the orb parameters init_ref and
          ior_lookup_table. These parameters are populated based on the
          commandline options. They are used by the
          resolve_initial_references () that calls get on these params
          through the singleton instance of the ORB core.

        * tao/POA.cpp: Added a TAO_Object_key_prefix (^t^a^o\0). All the
          changes are within #ifndef (TAO_NO_IOR_TABLE).  Changed the
          parse_key () to skip over the TAO Object key prefix.  Changed
          the create_object_key () to prepend TAO Object key to all
          generated object keys.

        * tao/Connect.cpp : Changed the handle_message () to parse the
          object key in the incoming IIOP request. If the object key is
          not preceded by ^(TAO)/0
          (which is now the default for all usual TAO object keys) then
          the key is treated as simple and looked up in the IOR table. A
          LOCATION_FORWARD/NOT_EXIST exception is raised if the key is
          found/not-found in the table.  Currently only the GIOP Request
          type messages are handled. Similar logic will be added to the
          GIOP LocateRequest type messages. This will go into the
          handle_locate method.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp: Changed the handle_input
          method to receive a multicast for a service, parse the data for
          the service name and a reply port.  Then use TCP to send back
          the IOR of the requested service. If the service is other than a
          "NameService" then the table is looked up for an IOR. The table
          can be populated through commandline orb parameters and can use
          iioploc/iiopname format IORs.

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tao/IOR_LookupTable.h:
        * tao/IOR_LookupTable.cpp: This is an abstraction over the hash
          map manager.  It is used by the orb to keep track of the
          object-id : IOR mappings. The table is owned by the orb and
          _tao_{add,find}_ior_{to,in}_table are APIs to access it.  The
          APIs take CORBA_Object * as a parameter and stringify it before
          adding to the table. This takes care of adding only valid IOR
          strings to the table.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp:
          Removed IOR_LookupTable, it is now in $TAO_ROOT/tao.

        * tao/params.{cpp,h,i}: Added the params init_ref,
          ior_lookup_table and default_init_ref to the orb core. Also
          added the GET/SET methods for these.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added the protocol prefixes iiopname and iioploc.

Mon Mar 22 14:13:17 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile,orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: added ace_components
          support for TAO_COMPONENTS and ORBSVCS_COMPONENTS, respectively.
          This allows other Makefiles to determine which components were
          built into libTAO and liborbsvcs.

Sun Mar 21 22:33:17 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp (init): The second call to sock_rcvbuf_size()
          should be sock_sndbuf_size().  Thanks to Russ Noseworthy for
          reporting this.

Sun Mar 21 21:23:44 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.15 released.

Sun Mar 21 20:52:58 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.14 released.

Sun Mar 21 20:27:37 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/objref.cpp:
          The test for object references was broken; but only Linux/EGCS
          triggered the error.

Sun Mar 21 15:45:04 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
          Added missing comma in timeprobe message string array.

Sun Mar 21 14:47:12 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): Used #ifdef
          (ACE_LACKS_U_LONGLONG_T) instead of #ifdef (VXWORKS)||(CHORUS)

Sat Mar 20 23:38:39 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp:
        * tests/MT_Client/server.dsp:
        * tests/MT_Client/client.dsp:

          Fixed some project settings for the above project files.

Sat Mar 20 20:27:54 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/MT_Client/MT_Client.dsw:
          Added projects and workspace for this test, thanks to Irfan
          for helping me out with it.

        * tests/MT_Client/README:
        * tests/MT_Client/run_test.pl:
          Added canonical files to the example.

        * tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:
          Added an error message in case thread creation fails.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
          Added a debug message when orb->shutdown() is called.

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
          Removed one method from the Profile classes that was only used
          here.  Used the constructor instead, which is more efficient,
          anyway.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/Makefile:
          Removed call to upper level Makefile, that's not the style we
          use.

Sat Mar 20 19:10:48 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/Pluggable.h:
        * tao/Pluggable.cpp:
          Fixed a nasty concurency problem in the Cached_Connector. The
          solution is to separate the path to return the new hint and the
          new Svc_Handler from the Cached_Connector (check the ACE
          changelog for details).
          We store the profile and transport used for an invocation in the
          Invocation object to avoid the same concurrency problems. In
          this way if another thread changes the profile_in_use() of the
          stub object that we are using we are not affected.
          We still need to check that the modifications to the MProfile
          and to STUB_Object object are thread-safe.

Sat Mar 20 15:21:41 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_i.h:

          Implemented persistance for the number of cans.  It saves
          it to a file.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_server_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_server_i.h:

          Removed leftover references to Paper Airplanes.

        * examples/Quoter/Factor_Finder.dsp:
        * examples/Quoter/client.dsp:
        * examples/Quoter/server.dsp:

          Removed the generated headers from the projects.  I don't
          think the listing of generated classes in classview is
          helpful.

        * examples/Quoter/Quoter_i.h:
        * examples/Quoter/Quoter_i.cpp:

          Fixed some warnings.

        * tests/MT_Client/test_i.h:
        * tests/MT_Client/test_i.i:
          New test that runs a MT client using the same object reference
          is all threads. Notice that this may be a bad idea
          performance-wise, but it must work correctly.

Sat Mar 20 13:38:23 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Timeprobe.h:
          Left some macros uncommented which would lead to link
          errors when building TAO. Fixed.

Sat Mar 20 11:06:16 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): Only print an error message if
          the TAO_debug level is > 0.  Also, make sure to terminate the
          line with '\n'.  Thanks to Russ Noseworthy for reporting this.

Sat Mar 20 01:34:28 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Renamed the timeprobe macros that are pertinent to
          the pluggable protocols test and added a macro to
          Timeprobe.h that turns off all the others.

Fri Mar 19 22:04:55 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode):
          When decoding an Any we need to create a Message_Block, use
          append() to copy the contents of the CDR stream and then store
          the message block into the any for later decoding (when we
          either use DynAny or we have enough static information).
          The manipulation of the Message_Block was incorrect: the data
          was copied using an OutputCDR stream, that copies the contents
          but acts on a duplicate of the Message_Block, thus, it does not
          update the wr_ptr() and rd_ptr().
          We corrected this problem and things are happy again.

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.h (class DatabaseImpl): Switched the
          memory allocator to be a local one rather than a persistent one.

          Carl Grinstead <grinstea@tsunami.com> and
          James A. Risinger <james@tsunami.com>

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp:
          The CDR class changed to ACE_CDR.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          By default we must generate "tao/corba.h" instead of
          <tao/corba.h>; in other words the compiler behaves as if the if
          the "-in" option was used.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
          Added an error message if the -i option is missused, only -ic
          and -in are valid.

        * Updated the dependencies since to exploit the change in the
          generate #includes.

Fri Mar 19 14:27:58 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp:
          Changed DatabaseImpl::Entry::_is_a() to use >>= before
          comparing arg values. This slows down the test code, but
          TAO defers populating the void* field of the Any until
          necessary (most of the time ;-)), which speeds up everything else.

Fri Mar 19 14:20:58 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp:
          Fixed an incorrect (and on closer inspection, unnecessary)
          use of TAO_CHECK_ENV. Also added a release() for a newly
          allocated (and immedialtely duplicated) message block.

Fri Mar 19 01:19:16 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.h:
          Typo in comments.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp:
          Fixed IIOP_Server_Request::arguments(), which was
          totally broken, with a change suggested by Carlos.

1999-03-18  Seth Widoff  <swidoff@cs.cmu.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.cpp:
          Returning from a query where the request_id had been seen wasn't
          allocating memory for the out parameters. This was causing an
          unwholesome seg fault. Thanks to Pradeep Gore
          <pradeep@cs.wustl.edu> for discovering this.

Thu Mar 18 21:06:58 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Strategy_Factory.cpp
          (Active_Object_Map_Creation_Parameters): removed extraneous
          semicolon following the function definition.

1999-03-18  Seth Widoff  <swidoff@cs.cmu.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.cpp:
          On Linux, the get_host_name call added the domain name complete
          with dots. Since I'm using the hostname as part of the link
          identifiers for the trader federation, dots are bad. I changed
          the dots to underscores.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trader/Offer_Importer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trader/Offer_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trader/Service_Type_Exporter.cpp:
          Some vestigial TAO_HAS_OBJECT_IN_STRUCT_MARSHAL_BUG code was
          being compiled and screwing up the exporter_test for federated
          exports. That code has been vanquished.

Thu Mar 18 16:43:44 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp (execute): fixed NT
        warnings in two Naming Service tests.

Thu Mar 18 15:41:08 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/run_test.pl: Fixed spelling error

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp
          (test_delete_property, test_get_property_value):
          Fixed warnings about unused arguments.  Fixed conversion from
          `CORBA_Object_var' to non-scalar type `CORBA_Any::to_object'
          problem.  Thanks to Jeff for helping me out on this.

Thu Mar 18 01:54:09 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAC.h: Fixed all the _out copy constructors to prevent
          warnings.

Wed Mar 17 23:39:44 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp (handle_input):

          1) Made the server send only 1 reply in response to multicast,
          since the client (ORB.cpp) was modified to use multiple
          attempts, i.e., it's the responsibility of the client to attempt
          to insure 'reliability', server just replies once.

          2) If replying to a multicast fails, the multicast handler is
          *not* deregistered from the reactor, unless we get some really
          bad errno.  This needs to be further refined.  This fixes the
          bug on Linux servers of multicast not working properly.

          Thanks to Seth Widoff for tracking this down.

Wed Mar 17 22:53:33 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp: Phase one of the new POA design is complete.

          - We now have support for active demuxing of user defined
            ids. This is achieved by using a active demux hint field in
            the object key.

          - We have support for reactivating servants with system
            generated ids.  In this case, system ids are simply generated
            by incrementing a counter. Note that in this case, the id ->
            servant map is a hash map since active demux keys cannot be
            reused once deactivated. However, the good news is that the
            active demux key can be used as the hint in the object key.

          - The use of the hint in the object key is optional.  If used,
            the lookups are faster (unless the hint is invalidated by a
            deactivation or by restarting a persistent POA).  However,
            using the hint results in a larger IOR, and more memory being
            used in the active object map.  This option can be controlled
            through the -ORBactivehintinids runtime switch and is turned
            on by default.

          - If the applications knows that reactivations will not occur,
            they can simply use the old scheme of directly using the
            active demux key as the system id.  This will (a) make the IOR
            shorter, (b) less memory will be used in the active object
            map, and (c) the lookups will be quicker and (more)
            predictable.

          - Etherialization of servants (through the use of a Servant
            Activator) is temporarily disabled.  Once we fix the reference
            counting on the servants, this will start working again.

          - Removed the POA exceptions from the list of system exceptions,
            and reverted them back to being user exceptions.

          - Timestamps are no longer used in persistent object keys.

          - Removed the TAO specific synchronization POA policy.  In the
            new POA design, this scheme will not be required.  Also,
            removed the POA locking example in
            $TAO_ROOT/examples/POA/locking.

        * examples/POA/Identity/: Added new example to test a whole bunch
          of conversions from servant to id to reference. The example is
          designed to test the new POA IOR creation and its Active Object
          Map.

        * tao: Added support for minimalCORBA to TAO. For some
          applications CORBA is too large to meet exacting size and
          performance requirements. Such scenarios require a cut-down
          version of CORBA. This cut-down version is called
          minimumCORBA. minimumCORBA defines a profile (or subset) of
          CORBA where the following features are removed:

          - Dynamic Invocation Interface
          - Dynamic Skeleton Interface
          - Dynamic Any
          - Interface Repository
          - Interceptors
          - Advance POA features:
            - Servant Managers
            - Adaptor Activators
            - Most POA Manager features

          On platforms that use the Makefiles, simply minimum_corba=1. On
          Win32, define TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA in the orbconf.h file.

        * tao/Makefile: Added support for measuring subsets of TAO.  These
          subsets are not independent, but are useful in providing an idea
          of how big different components of the ORB are.

        * tao/Server_Strategy_Factory.cpp: Remove the active object map
          creation responsibilities from this class.  Now it simply holds
          on to the creation parameters and feeds them to the active
          object map constructor.

        * tao/Sequence_T.i (operator->): Added operator-> to
          TAO_Object_Manager.  Also, made the in() method return a
          non-const pointer.  Missing still is operator= taking
          T::var_type. Other managers should also be check for these
          features (Carlos said he'll look into it).

        * examples/POA/Loader/run_test.pl:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/run_test.pl:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Activation/run_test.pl:

          - We now have support for active demuxing of user defined
            ids. This is achieved by using a active demux hint field in
            the object key.

          - We have support for reactivating servants with system
            generated ids.  In this case, system ids are simply generated
            by incrementing a counter. Note that in this case, the id ->
            servant map is a hash map since active demux keys cannot be
            reused once deactivated. However, the good news is that the
            active demux key can be used as the hint in the object key.

          - The use of the hint in the object key is optional.  If used,
            the lookups are faster (unless the hint is invalidated by a
            deactivation or by restarting a persistent POA).  However,
            using the hint results in a larger IOR, and more memory being
            used in the active object map.  This option can be controlled
            through the -ORBactivehintinids runtime switch and is turned
            on by default.

          - If the applications knows that reactivations will not occur,
            they can simply use the old scheme of directly using the
            active demux key as the system id.  This will (a) make the IOR
            shorter, (b) less memory will be used in the active object
            map, and (c) the lookups will be quicker and (more)
            predictable.

          - Etherialization of servants (through the use of a Servant
            Activator) is temporarily disabled.  Once we fix the reference
            counting on the servants, this will start working again.

          - Removed the POA exceptions from the list of system exceptions,
            and reverted them back to being user exceptions.

          - Timestamps are no longer used in persistent object keys.

          - Removed the TAO specific synchronization POA policy.  In the
            new POA design, this scheme will not be required.  Also,
            removed the POA locking example in
            $TAO_ROOT/examples/POA/locking.

        * examples/POA/Identity/: Added new example to test a whole bunch
          of conversions from servant to id to reference. The example is
          designed to test the new POA IOR creation and its Active Object
          Map.

        * tao: Added support for minimalCORBA to TAO. For some
          applications CORBA is too large to meet exacting size and
          performance requirements. Such scenarios require a cut-down
          version of CORBA. This cut-down version is called
          minimumCORBA. minimumCORBA defines a profile (or subset) of
          CORBA where the following features are removed:

          - Dynamic Invocation Interface
          - Dynamic Skeleton Interface
          - Dynamic Any
          - Interface Repository
          - Interceptors
          - Advance POA features:
            - Servant Managers
            - Adpator Activators
            - Most POA Manager features

          On platforms that use the Makefiles, simply minimum_corba=1. On
          Win32, define TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA in the orbconf.h file.

        * tao/Makefile: Added support for measuring subsets of TAO.  These
          subsets are not independent, but are useful in providing an idea
          of how big different components of the ORB are.

        * tao/Server_Strategy_Factory.cpp: Remove the active object map
          creation responsibilities from this class.  Now it simply holds
          on to the creation parameters and feeds them to the active
          object map constructor.

        * tao/Sequence_T.i (operator->): Added operator-> to
          TAO_Object_Manager.  Also, made the in() method return a
          non-const pointer.  Missing still is operator= taking
          T::var_type. Other managers should also be check for these
          features (Carlos said he'll look into it).

        * examples/POA/Loader/run_test.pl:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/run_test.pl:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Activation/run_test.pl:

          Fixed the above scripts to pass the extra parameters along to
          the client and the server.

        * examples/POA/DSI/server.cpp: Added missing #include
          "ace/Get_Opt.h"

Wed Mar 17 19:36:31 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Fixed compilation errors for VxWorks and CHORUS. Used the
        constructor of ACE_ULongLong (UINT32, UINT32) for VxWorks which
        doesnt have an unsigned long long.  *
        orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout) *
        orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO).

Wed Mar 17 19:00:14 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.h: FreeBSD also
          needs to get SCHED_PRIORITY at runtime.  Thanks to Russell
          L. Carter <rcarter@consys.com> for reporting this.

Wed Mar 17 14:47:32 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/orbcore.html: Added an entry about the new
          Context stuff and removed one about DynAnys being "in progress".

Wed Mar 17 14:26:14 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/nestea_i.cpp: Removed the #include
          "time.h" from these files.  They shouldn't be needed there.

Wed Mar 17 13:33:49 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Context.i: Removed definition of is_nil(). Must have been
          pasted in by mistake. Anyway, our Contexts are always nil, so we
          don't need it.

Wed Mar 17 13:14:16 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.cpp: Added a check for NULL ACE_Message_Block pointer in
          _tao_replace().

        * tao/Request.i: Type in comments.

        *tao/Context.{h,i,cpp}: New files for our minimal Context support,
          basically just so Object::_create_request() can be compliant.

        * tao/Object.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/TAO.dsp:
        * tao/Makefile: Other files that needed additions for Context
          support.

        * TAO/tests/param_test/client.cpp:
        * TAO/Benchmark/Marshal_Test/TAO/tao_marshal_client.cpp: Test
          files that use _create_request() and so needed the added Context
          arg in the calls.

Wed Mar 17 12:28:32 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
          Fixed a cut-and-paste error. Thanks to Greg Holtmeyer
          <Greg.Holtmeyer@MW.Boeing.com> for pointing this out.

Wed Mar 17 11:32:01 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/objref.cpp
        * tests/Param_Test/ub_objref_seq.cpp: Fixed warnings from the
          build.

Wed Mar 17 10:05:15 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP: Replaced *IIOP_LITE* with *GIOP_LITE* since we've
          renamed this.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp (recv_request): Replaced the magic number 5 with
          TAO_IIOP_LITE_HEADER_LEN.  Thanks to the ever vigilant Mark
          Boriak for reporting this.

Wed Mar 17 08:39:59 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.13 released.

Wed Mar 17 02:06:47 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.12 released.

Tue Mar 17 01:01:57 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp (_non_existent):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp
          (gen_marshal_and_invoke): <_invoke_status> should be set before
          use (at least according to g++).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): Changed
          <this->attr_utc_time_.inacchi> to 0 since the conversion
          routines Vishal used are not supported on vxworks. Vishal should
          consult David in fixing this correctly.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout): Also
          changed <lowest_time> to 0.  Vishal should fix this also.

Tue Mar 16 15:52:57 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAManager.i (lock): moved function definition before inline
          activate (), because that function uses it.

Tue Mar 16 15:41:13 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/*.cpp Made them exception safe using the latest
          ACE_TRY macros. Had a bunch of code which did not handle
          exception. Added code so that they are exception safe..

Tue Mar 16 15:34:29 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/AccountManager_i.cpp: removed
          ACE_Hash<ACE_CString> and ACE_Equal_To<ACE_CString> explicit
          template instantiations, because they're in tao/POA.cpp.  Thanks
          to Wei Chiang for reporting this.

1999-03-16  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp: Removed a continue statement in the
          marshal method since it prevented an exception from getting
          printed on the server side if the idl method had no arguments
          and only a return value.

Tue Mar 16 02:25:56 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/private_ch.cpp: A line of
          code was being generated without an ending semicolon.

Tue Mar 16 00:26:01 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp: Used Any::_tao_get_cdr() in init_reply()
          instead of casting to ACE_Messsage_Block* the return of
          Any::value().  Also streamlined dsi_marshal(), again based on
          the use of Any::_tao_get_cdr().

        * tao/Any.cpp: Changed the constructor from ACE_Message_Block* to
          set the value of any_owns_data_ to 0, since the value_ of this
          Any is 0, so we want the value() call to return the cdr_.

Mon Mar 15 21:08:55 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAC.cpp: Replaced all the <<= and >>= with newer versions
          generated by the latest TAO IDL compiler.

Mon Mar 15 19:09:35 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.cpp (run): Added the other run() methods to the
          ORB_Manager.  Thanks to Jean-Marc Strauss
          <jms97@club-internet.fr> for pointing this out.

Mon Mar 15 02:27:05 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Environment.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Exception.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Profile.{h,i}: Removed all FLICK specific code.  Thanks
          very much to Tim Stack for removing the dependency from FLICK.

Mon Mar 15 17:35:14 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/field_ch.cpp (visit_predefined_type):
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/private_ch.cpp
          (visit_predefined_type): For struct/union members that are
          object references, we always generate the TAO_Object_Field_T
          parametrized type. Earlier we were generating CORBA::Object_var
          if the member was of the type CORBA::Object and the parametrized
          type for interfaces. However, this was causing runtime errors in
          the (de)marshaling engine.

        * tao/{encode, decode}.cpp (TAO_Marshal_Struct::{encode,decode}):
          Members that are simple CORBA::Object_ptr and not a user defined
          interface type is also treated in the same way as if it was an
          interface type. Thus, we can treat everything as a
          TAO_Object_Field_T<CORBA::Object>* type.

Mon Mar 15 15:27:34 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Life_Cycle_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Life_Cycle_Service.h:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Life_Cycle_Service_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Life_Cycle_Service_i.h:
          Renamed to the following to have a more consistent
          naming scheme.

        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/LifeCycle_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/LifeCycle_Service.h:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/LifeCycle_Service_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/LifeCycle_Service_i.h:
          New file names.

        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/LifeCycle_Service.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Makefile:
          Uses the new names.

Mon Mar 15 02:27:05 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAManager.i: Fixed typos.

        * tao/POAManager.h: Added include 'poa_macros.h'.

Mon Mar 15 10:48:39 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/except.cpp: Fixed throw expression. In
          platforms that support native C++ exceptions the right way to
          throw is TAO_THROW(Foo()); not TAO_THROW(Foo).  Of course the
          form proposed works in platforms without native C++ exceptions
          too.

Mon Mar 15 10:42:27 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * tao/POAManager.{h,i,cpp}: There were some compile errors in teh
          changes that Nanbor made. There was a need to include the
          poa_macros.h file and change "env" to "ACE_TRY_ENV".

        * tao/encode.cpp (Alias::encode): The "data" parameter was first
          cast to char* and then passed to stream->encode. Instead, we now
          pass data itself. I am not sure, however, if this will fix some
          of the runtime errors we are getting in the Trading Service.

Mon Mar 15 02:27:05 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.{h,cpp}: Applied "some" ACE try macros into POA.
          (etherealize_servants): Moved the function out of destroy
          method.

        * tao/POAManager.{h,i,cpp} (remove_poa): Removed the POAManager if
          there is no more POA under this POAManager's control.  The
          current implementation may cause potential race condition when
          one thread hold the lock to remove the last POA and another
          thread is blocked the POAManager's lock and is trying to add
          another POA into this POAManager.  This should be solved by
          refcounting the POAMnanger's usage but currently, POA uses
          TAO_POA_Manager directly...

        * tao/POAManager.{h,i,cpp} (deactivate_i): According to the spec.,
          this function should etherealize servants in the managing POAs
          and wait for request completion instead of destroying the POAs.
          (activate_i,hold_requests_i,discard_requests_i,deactivate_i):
          Added these no-lock functions.

Sun Mar 14 18:05:51 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/*.h
        * tests/Param_Test/*.cpp: Made the changes that are necessary
          because of the previous changes to the tao/Request.*

Sun Mar 14 14:58:51 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.i:
        * tao/Request.cpp:
        * tao/Request.h: Changed the arguments of two method call in the
          Request class. They are send_oneway () and invoke (). They now
          take in the environment variable ACE_TRY_ENV that should be
          passed in from the application. These methods were using a
          variable env_ stored in the class itself. The variable env_ has
          also been removed thus necesitating the users of the API to send
          their own environment variables that should be theoretically in
          a TRY block.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp: Made the
          changes that is a fallout of the above changes..

Sun Mar 14 14:13:22 19  99  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout): Fixed
          warnings reported by David and Carlos for g++/egcs.  Replaced
          the constant 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF with 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFull and
          for platforms lacking Ulonglong, called the constructor of
          ACE_U_LongLong.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout): Added
          the ACE_UINT64_LITERAL () to fix an NT warning.

Sat Mar 13 23:35:01 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosEC_Multiple.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp: fixed minor
          compile warnings regarding "statements not reached", "unused
          parameters", and using .in ().

Sat Mar 13 23:33:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp: removed trailing semicolons from instantiation
          pragmas.

Sat Mar 13 21:53:57 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added the Inaccuracy measure to the time returned by a Universal
          Time Object (UTO). The inaccuracy is a 64 bit number broken into
          inacchi and inacclo as:

                  Inaccuracy 64-bits
          |------------------------------------|
          |         | inacchi |   inacclo      |
          |------------------------------------|
            16-bits   16-bits     32-bits

          The current measure of inaccuracy is the skew in synchronization
          of the clerk's time. It is the difference in the largest and
          smallest times from servers that the clerk syncs its time
          with. The inaccuracy is dynamically updated with every time
          synchronization cycle.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout): Added
          the logic to calculate the inaccuracy from the times returned by
          servers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp: Constructed the
          Inaccuracy within UTO from the hi,lo values in UTC struct in
          uto_from_utc(). Filled the UTO with the current inaccuracy
          estimate in universal_time (). Added the GET/SET methods for the
          inaccuracy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h: Added a class
          variable for inaccuracy estimate and the declarations for the
          GET/SET methods. These are used by the Timer_Helper class to set
          the inaccuracy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp: Changed the constructor to
          initialise the UTO inacchi and inacclo with properly extracted
          bits from the given inaccuracy. Rewrote the GET method for
          inaccuracy to construct the inaccuracy from the UTC struct hi,lo
          values. This was previously being returned as just the addition
          of hi and lo values.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Client_i.cpp : Changed the test to test for
          the newly added inaccuracy and timezone information in the UTO
          time.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/README : Updated to include this addition
          in the Time Service.  Thanks to Brian Dance
          <Brian_Dance@UECCS.co.uk> for reporting this.

Sat Mar 13 11:58:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp: Removed unused variable,
          thanks to David Levine for reporting this.

        * TAO-INSTALL.html: Updated the notes on how to compile TAO.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs_static.dsp: Added the new event channel
          files to the static library.  Also removed some old files that
          are no longer used (Event/Task_Manager.cpp) thanks to Francois
          Bernier <fbernier@gel.ulaval.ca> for reporting this problem.

Sat Mar 13 11:57:27 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init): Revised the multicast_query() stuff just
          a bit to make it easier to maintain.

Sat Mar 13 00:44:51 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.11 released.

Fri Mar 12 20:48:00 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/IR_Helper.cpp: Fixed improper use of
          TAO_RETHROW macros.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Fixed problem in location forwarding, the
          test for errors while demarshaling the new object reference was
          inverted.

Fri Mar 12 19:51:36 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: Fixed some
          bugs with forwarding support in void functions without output
          arguments.

        * tao/Object.cpp: Fixed warning about unused variable.

          Now uses ACE exception handling macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_client_i.cpp:
          Added the -k option for IOR input.

Fri Mar 12 14:11:28 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ORB.h, ORB.cpp and orbconf.h: Fixed multicast problem.  Removed
          dynamic memory allocation in multicast_query () and now pass a
          pointer to a buffer allocated on the stack in
          multicast_to_service ().  Also added a macro
          TAO_DEFAULT_MULTICAST_SEND_ATTEMPTS = 2.  This control the
          number of attempts multicast)query () will make to get a
          response.

          Also moved a call to multicast.close () to after to attempt
          loop.  It seems when multicast.close () is called the reply
          packet from the server is lost on solaris hosts.  By moving this
          to after the recv the packets are now read on the first recv.

Fri Mar 12 12:23:07 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp (handle_timeout):
          Retrieved the timezone information and set the time displacement
          factor for the clerk's time.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h : Added the
          GET/SET methods for the time displacement factor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp : Added
          implementation for the above methods. Passed the time zone
          information to the UTO created in universal_time ().

          The timer_helper uses the newly added timezone wrappers of
          OS.h. These wrappers are yet to be tested on NT. Thanks to Brian
          Dance <Brian_Dance@UECCS.co.uk> for reporting this.

Fri Mar 12 10:38:18 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * tao/CDR_Interpreter.cpp: setup_entry for objrect references
          required TAO_Object_Field_T<CORBA_Object> as the first parameter
          instead of CORBA_OBject_ptr for the accurate size
          computation. Thanks to Alexey Gadzhiev <alg@null.ru> for
          reporting the bug and supplying us with a test program and other
          information to help us fix the bug.

        * tao/{encode, decode, deep_free}.cpp: In encode/decode/deep_free
          for structures, for the case where we are dealing with fields
          that are object references, we cast the data to
          TAO_Object_Field_T<CORBA_Object>* instead of simply
          TAO_Object_Field*. These changes were made during the bug fix
          described aove. These fixes also removed the Array Bounds Read
          (ABR) error message produced by Purify.

Fri Mar 12 00:35:47 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp Fixed the problem of client
          not being able to resolve Naming Service ior through multicast
          when client and server are run on different hosts.  Thanks to
          Steve Totten for tracking down since when this was broken, and
          to Carlos O'Ryan for providing hypotheses as to why.

          Made the server wait a little bit before sending a reply to the
          multicast as well as send a reply several times.  This 1) gives
          client a chance to start listening for a reply, 2) provides a
          better protection against packet loss.  (The problem was
          occuring because the server sent a reply before the client had a
          chance to start receiving.  This was happening due to the added
          dynamic memory allocation in the client code in the interval
          between multicast_send and reply_receive).

          A more flexible policy-based solution should be added (as
          opposed to hardcoding intervals and retries).  This will
          probably be a part of Vishal's upcoming Interoperable Naming
          Service changes.

          Values encoded in the code now should work for most
          platforms/networks.  However, they are not guaranteed to work
          for all!  Part of the problem is that UDP is unreliable, so in
          theory can be retransmitted 100 times and still not work.  Also,
          specific network configurations (busy network, busy hosts, old
          routers, etc.) may have special needs.  Again, this should be
          better addressed once hardcoded values are replaced by flexible
          policies.

Thu Mar 11 22:49:35 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): INET_Addr::get_port_number ()
          returns a port number converted to host byte order.  Made
          changes to account for that.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp: Made sure that upon the
          receipt of the multicast packet, the reply was sent to the port
          indicated in the array contained in the packet as opposed to the
          port from which the packet came from.

Thu Mar 11 20:41:39 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.cpp: There were some major
          inconsistencies with byte order conversions.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): Fixed some subtle bugs with
          multicast.  First, we were sending a struct when we should have
          been sending an array (due to portability issues with struct
          padding).  Second, we weren't being consistent with ACE macros.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (multicast_query): There was a read of BUFSIZ where
          there should have been a read of ACE_MAX_DGRAM_SIZE.  Thanks to
          Marina for noticing this.

Thu Mar 11 20:46:04 1999  Marina Spivak  <marina@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp: In the
          CosNaming_Client::init () changed

              // Initialize ORB.
                is->orbmgr_.init (argc,
                                  argv,
                                  TAO_TRY_ENV);
          to
              // Initialize ORB.
              this->orbmgr_.init (this->argc_,
                                  this->argv_,
                                  TAO_TRY_ENV);

          to facilitate proper processing of the arguments.

Thu Mar 11 19:55:18 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp: Fixed template instantiations and some warnings.

        * tao/encode.cpp: Removed unused variable.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl: Use IOR object references, they
          are actually easier than URL-style.

Thu Mar 11 19:07:20 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.i:
        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Implemented compiled marshaling and demarshaling of object
          references.  Removed uses of do_static_call() from the
          CORBA::Object class in favor of compiled marshaling.  Removed
          several uses of interpretive marshaling, we can use compiled
          marshaling now.

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl: The client cleanly shutdowns the
          server now.

Thu Mar 11 16:36:34 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp: Fixed code
          generation of _ptr_type and _var_type typedefs to include a
          guard against certain versions of g++.

Thu Mar 11 14:30:05 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp: Check for error in call
          to Repository::get_hostport

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp: Enabled
          test for unions and the RTI data structure.

Thu Mar 11 13:59:05 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{i,cpp} (operator<<=): un-inlined, to avoid use of
          inline CORBA::string_dup () before definition.

Thu Mar 11 13:43:12 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp: Enabled compiled marshaling by
          default (again).

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: Fixed
          generated code to handle location forwarding.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Minor cosmetic fixes.

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/airplane_client_i.cpp: We don't abort on
          the first exception, instead we keep trying. We also clear the
          environment before making a request.

Wed Mar 10 16:43:55 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Generator.cpp:
          The type of event generated by the filter is can be passed in
          the Filter constructor.  This is also used to control if the
          event is a one shot timeout or an interval timeout.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp: We must
          create a Timeout_Filter for events of type ACE_ES_TIMEOUT_EVENT
          too.  The type of event is passed to the Timeout_Filter.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp: Only push events if
          the consumer is not disconnected.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.cpp: Fixed
          memory managment bug.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp: The UDP gateway does
          not require an scheduler, it can be argued that it cannot use an
          scheduler because UDP is not suitable for hard real-time
          systems.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp: Removed scheduler and some
          includes related to the old EC.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set.h: Work around
          horrible g++ 2.7.2 bug with forward declaration of templates.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h: Also fixed a couple
          of g++ 2.7.2 warnings, that look like compiler bugs to me.

        * tao/decode.cpp: Updated some comments in the object reference
          decoder.

        * tests/CDR/allocator.cpp: Minor cosmetic fixes.

Wed Mar 10 10:43:08 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/idl.yy: The front-end was incorrectly handling
          "const" definitions of type strings. Thanks to Yaolong Lan
          (lyaolong@cs.sunysb.edu) for reporting the problem.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/{y.tab.cpp, y.tab.h, lex.yy.cpp}: Regenerated since
          idl.yy was modified.

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.h
        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.cpp

          Renamed these files to:

        * tao/CDR_Interpreter.h
        * tao/CDR_Interpreter.cpp
          All references to IIOP_Interpreter have been changed to
          CDR_Interpreter since "IIOP_Interpreter" is no longer an
          accurate name for the classes and files in question.

Tue Mar  9 19:58:54 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Quoter/Factory_Finder.cpp:
        * examples/Quoter/Generic_Factory.cpp:
        * examples/Quoter/server.cpp: Fixed null-pointer usage in the
          server destructors when the naming service wasn't resolved.

        * examples/Quoter/server.cpp: Also fixed some memory leaks.

Tue Mar  9 13:42:49 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe: Regenerated the y.tab.cpp file using Berkeley yacc
          rather than yacc so the nifty tracing features will be enabled.

Tue Mar  9 13:05:49 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp: Fixed all the
          Sequence_out parameters to get created even though their length
          may be zero. This is according to the CORBA spec.

Tue Mar 09 01:16:41 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.10 released.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Fixed a problem in the Makefile.

Mon Mar 08 22:20:32 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile (TAO_ORBSVCS_SRCS): if the Trader is
          built without the Naming Service in TAO_ORBSVCS, add
          IOR_Multicast because the Trader needs it.  Thanks to Seth for
          reporting this.

          Change the iioplite option to gioplite.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.h:
        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:
          Added support for file://-style IORs; we simply use the
          ACE_Read_Buffer class to read the IOR from the file and then
          call string_to_object again.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Fixed debug message.

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp: Minor cosmetic fixes.

Mon Mar  8 20:09:07 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html: Added an entry about the
          Pluggable test.

Mon Mar  8 19:02:21 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ch.cpp: Added the new
          typedefs for _ptr_type and _var_type (see Advanced CORBA
          Programming with C++, section 7.6.1).  I couldn't find anywhere
          that the IDL compiler generates code for template member
          functions - everything like that in orbsvcs seems to be
          handwritten. If anyone sees that I overlooked something. let me
          know.

Mon Mar  8 16:20:22 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.i: Moved CORBA::string_dup() into the *.i file and made
          it an inline method.  Thanks to Jon Biggar for suggesting this.

Mon Mar  8 16:46:36 1999  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/README: Changed description of correct test
          output to reflect change from get_host_by_name () to
          get_host_by_addr ().

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp: Altered the return values in
          verbosity_conversion to correspond to the changed values in
          ace/Log_Msg.h. Also modified logv to use get_host_by_addr ()
          rather than get_host_by_name (). This speeds things up
          somewhat. Thanks to Ulf Jährig for pointing this out.

Mon Mar  8 14:27:38 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
        * tao/Connect.cpp:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/skip.cpp: The first four files have the new ACE timeprobes
          for the pluggable protocols test. The last has a change in
          TAO_Marshal_Union::skip() from using
          (ACE_Message_Block *) Any::value() to Any::_tao_get_cdr ().

Mon Mar  8 13:44:23 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Added a superfast implementation of
          CORBA::string_copy().  Thanks to Terry Rosenbaum
          <Terry.Rosenbaum@Radiology.MSU.edu> for suggesting this and to
          Jon Biggar <jon@biggar.org> for optimizing it still further ;-).

Mon Mar  8 11:08:02 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/include/utl_scope.h:
          TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp: Incorporated the right scoping
          lookup rules based on the latest CORBA 2.3 revisions. Thanks to
          Torsten Kuepper <kuepper2@uni-wuppertal.de> for providing the
          patches.

Sun Mar  7 19:29:06 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html (bgcolor): Updated the documentation for the
          ORB configuration

Sun Mar 07 17:39:22 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (send): Remember to reset <iovcnt> after
          we send out a batch of data.

Sun Mar  7 17:27:31 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/client.cpp: Removed
          ACE_OS::thr_exit(). this was borrowed from
          IDL_Cubit/client.cpp. It has been decided that this usage is a
          "Bad Thing"[TM], and that line has been removed from the IDL
          Cubit client as well.

Sun Mar 07 16:39:03 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp (main): removed
          call to ACE_OS::thr_exit ().  It's no longer necessary; it's
          just a relic from a workaround that's no longer needed.  Thanks
          to Jeff for noticing it.

Sun Mar  7 16:03:51 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/PP_Test_Client.{h,cpp}:

        * TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/README: New files implementing
          tests for pluggable protocols stuff, using ACE
          Timeprobes. Builds and runs fine on NT, builds with suncc, but
          client seg faults on ACE_OS::thr_exit().  I've emailed the doc
          group to see if anyone can give me a hand with this bug.

Sun Mar  7 10:41:58 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp: Fixed the g++ warnings

Fri Mar  5 21:59:18 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Quoter/Factory_Finder.cpp:

        * examples/Quoter/client.h:
        * examples/Quoter/server.cpp:
        * examples/Quoter/server.h: In general, redid a lot of exception
          handling to work better with native exceptions.

Fri Mar  5 20:50:23 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile: included the CosEvent_Channel in the list of
          directories to build.

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service{.h, .cpp}: replaced
          the TAO_TRY macros with ACE_ macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/{*.h, *.cpp}: replaced the TAO_TRY
          macros with ACE_ macros.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer{.h.cpp}: added an ORB
          pointer, which is used to shutdown the ORB after a <push> is
          received by a consumer.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic{.h, .cpp}: fixed a bug
          that caused this test to fail - thanks to Jim Crossley
          <jim@lads.com> for pointing this out.  The RtEC needs to be
          constructed with a valid TAO_Reactive_Module_Factory. Creating
          the Rtec on the heap with an initialized module factory fixed
          this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple {*.h, *.cpp} replaced the TAO_TRY
          macros with ACE_ macros.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: updated the CosEC information.

Fri Mar  5 18:11:04 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Timeout_Generator.cpp: Fixed const
          correctness problem, Sun/CC didn't even give a warning for this
          one!

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set.cpp: Added
          missing template instantiation.

Fri Mar  5 15:12:00 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
        * tao/encode.cpp:
        * tao/skip.cpp: The debug messages are only be printed out if

Fri Mar 05 12:51:08 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: replaced -Wno-used for g++, but just for pre-2.8.
          It has many complaints about unused parameters in generated
          code.

Fri Mar  5 12:15:50 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.cpp: Removed some repeated

          cast to ACE_Message_Block* of the return value of
          _tao_get_cdr().

Thu Mar  4 18:40:45 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CurrentC.cpp: Changed the code for the >>= operator to get
          rid of another Any::value() inconsistency and to reflect what
          the IDL compiler now generates for these operators.

Thu Mar  4 16:53:28 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_ss.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp: The ACE_EventChannel
          implementation does not shutdown the ORB anymore, instead we use
          composition in the Event_Service program to shutdown the ORB
          there (where it actually makes sense).

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i: Minor cosmetic

Thu Mar 04 10:22:55 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.cpp
          (parse_args): when type_count_ <= 0, moved the statement that
          resets it to 1 to before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN.  That way, it
          really will be reset to 1 :-)

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp (parse_args):
          when ec_concurrency_hwm_ <= 0, moved the statement that resets
          it to 1 to before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN.

Wed Mar  3 18:28:51 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set_T.cpp: Factored
          out the collection of ProxyPushSuppliers from the ConsumerAdmin
          class: it is used in other places like the SupplierFiltering
          strategies.  I also added extensive documentation about the
          several variations on this particular strategy.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Per_Supplier_Filter.cpp: Added a new
          SupplierFiltering strategy, simply keep the list of consumers
          for each supplier.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Conjunction_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Conjunction_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Disjunction_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Disjunction_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.cpp: Changed the mechanism
          to match suppliers and consumers: the filter objects have a new
          method that can be used to detect if a event is potentially
          interesting to the consumer.  The red-black tree is not needed
          anymore.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp: Moved the
          instantiation of the EventHeader red-black tree to this file,
          because now this is the only place we use it.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.cpp: Added new factory
          methods to create and detroy EC_ProxyPushSupplier_Set objects.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Added description of the
          TAO_DOTTED_DECIMAL_ADDRESSES macro.

        * tao/MProfile.i:
        * tao/Any.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp: Minor cosmetic fixes.

Wed Mar  3 18:15:14 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/client.dsp:
        * tests/Param_Test/server.dsp: Added big_union.

Wed Mar  3 03:05:06 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.dsp:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/README:
        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile: Removed all
          the naming service stuff from DII_Cubit_Test.  Made a note in
          the README file that the IDL server no longer uses it
          either. Also removed the orbsvcs library load from the makefile
          since we no longer need it. And removed client.h from the VC
          project file and the link to orbsvcsd.lib from same.

Tue Mar  2 17:36:29 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEventComm.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEventChannelAdmin.idl: added a comment header
          to describe the idl file contents.

Tue Mar  2 11:41:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DoubleVisComp.java: Added
          flexible monotonic scaling of all DoubleVisComp windows.

Tue Mar  2 02:32:34 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.{h,i,cpp}: Added new file IIOP_Profile.i for
          inline functions.  Moved some accessors from .cpp file to .i
          file.  Added _host_(), _port_(), _object_key_(),
          reset_object_addr() when TAO_USES_FLICK is defined.  Flick needs
          to access the structure directly.

Mon Mar  1 23:37:58 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Server_Request.cpp: Fixed yet another instance of backwards
          any_owns_data behavior, is dsi_marshal(). Will look at the rest
          of Server_Request.cpp later - there seems to be questionable
          stuff in the other methods as well.

Mon Mar  1 17:57:18 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/dynany_test/test_dynsequence.cpp: Fixed a
          double-deletion problem with a data string.  All the dynany test
          code will need to be looked over for memory-handling behavior
          since the many recent changes to the IDL compiler. Thanks to
          Barry Hoggard for reporting this bug.

Mon Mar  1 17:31:57 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/sfp.cpp: Added the flowProtocol:: class
          specifier for frameHeader so that it compiles on win32. Thanks
          to David Hooker <DHooker@uniview.net> for the fix.

Mon Mar 01 17:19:04 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.8 released.

Mon Mar  1 14:43:20 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/compiler.html: Fixed minor error in the IDL compiler
          documentation, thanks to Frederic Maria <fmaria@lucent.com> for
          pointing this out.

Mon Mar 01 14:20:44 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.7 released.

Mon Mar 01 08:28:26 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: removed ACE_Guard<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX> template
          instantiation, because it collided with
          ACE_Guard<ACE_Thread_Mutex> in ace/Synch.cpp.

Sat Feb 27 20:05:10 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_assign_cs.cpp: Removed
          unused variables.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp: The temporary used to
          read the discriminant must be declared using the fully qualified
          name of the type, because the operator>> is in the global scope.

Fri Feb 26 23:41:08 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Oops, unlinking
          of temp file should not be disable on non-Win32 platforms.
          Thanks to David for noticing this.

Fri Feb 26 23:30:12 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: removed the clean target, because it deleted
          tao_idl.  The realclean target does that.  Thanks to Tres Seaver
          <tseaver@palladion.com> for reporting this.

Fri Feb 26 21:03:47 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: Added support
          for forwarding in stubs generated with compiled marshaling.  We
          use the new ACE_TRY macros to do this.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_label.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_access_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_assign_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_type.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_union_branch.h: Fixed code generation for
          unions whose discriminators are enums. It wasn't prefixing the
          enum label with the scope where the enum was generated i.e. for
          enums defined inside a module Foo it was using "value1" instead
          of "Foo::value1".

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.cpp: Fixed Timeprobe use.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.cpp: Minor cosmetic
          fixes.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/README: Added more details, started a
          section that describes the interaction between the components.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp: The
          SupplierFiltering module splits an EventSet into single events
          before passing them to the ProxyPushSuppliers, this is needed so
          that filtering will work correctly.

Fri Feb 26 18:29:04 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/implrepo.conf
          tests/NestedUpcall/MT_Client_Test/client.conf
          examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/svc.conf
          examples/Quoter/client.conf
          examples/Quoter/server.conf
          performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf
          performance-tests/Thruput/TAO/svc.conf

          Changed -ORBdemuxstrategy option to
          -ORBsystemidpolicydemuxstrategy

Fri Feb 26 18:00:52 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Makefile:
        * tao/TAO.dsp: Removed file Align.h from the repository, the
          makefile and the project file. All that stuff moved to OS.h with
          the CDR classes.

Fri Feb 26 17:37:04 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added the function next_profile_retry to stub object.

Fri Feb 26 16:46:37 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added some methods to Stub_Object for forwarding.

Fri Feb 26 13:32:35 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/grid/README: New file for the benefit of the
          community. Thanks to Dr.Schmidt for reminding me to do this.

Fri Feb 26 12:44:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/big_union.cpp: Fixed some warnings for
          Linux/EGCS.  check_validity was incomplete.

        * tests/Param_Test/svc.conf: Removed obsolete options.

Fri Feb 26 11:35:51 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_factory.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/union_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_assign_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.h: Implemented
          compiled marshaling for unions.  I also had to debug and fix
          parts of the union implementation too.

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile:
        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl:
        * tests/Param_Test/tests.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/driver.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/driver.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/options.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/options.h:

        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.cpp:
        * tests/Param_Test/param_test_i.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/big_union.h:
        * tests/Param_Test/big_union.cpp: Added a new test for unions, the
          union contains many basic types, sequences, arrays, variable and
          fixed sized structures, object references, sequences, strings,
          etc.  I couldn't test unions inside unions because there seems
          to be a bug with union code generator.

Fri Feb 26 10:06:57 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Fixed inline function ordering in Stub.i!

Fri Feb 26 00:43:30 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs: Updated all the ORB services IDL files so that
          they are protected by #ifndef ... #endifs.  Thanks to Lothar
          Werzinger <werzinger.lothar@krones.de> for this suggestion.

Fri Feb 26 00:05:16 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.6 released.

Thu Feb 25 23:38:46 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp: Fixed another confusion between an Any's value
          and its message block. This one was in TAO_Marshal_Union.  Maybe
          unions will work a little better now ;-).

Thu Feb 25 20:19:26 1999  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Cubit_Task.h:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Cubit_Task.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.h:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.h:
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp:

        Modified these files so that they will compile if ACE was built
        without thread support by changing ACE_MT_SYNCH macros to
        ACE_SYNCH and by using the ACE_SYNCH_SEMAPHORE macro instead of
        ACE_Thread_Semaphore.  Thanks to Doug for suggesting the ACE_SYNCH
        changes.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp: Modified
          these files so that they will compile if ACE was built without
          thread support by changing ACE_MT_SYNCH macros to ACE_SYNCH and
          by using the ACE_SYNCH_SEMAPHORE macro instead of
          ACE_Thread_Semaphore.  Thanks to Doug for suggesting the
          ACE_SYNCH changes.

        ACE_Condition in Task_Client.h for the unthreaded case will be
        dealt with soon.

          ACE_Condition in Task_Client.h for the unthreaded case will be
          dealt with soon.

Thu Feb 25 18:16:31 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/compiled_marshal_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/compiled_marshal_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/compiled_marshal.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/cdr_op_cs.cpp: IDL generated code
          was passing in the size instead of the length for bounded
          strings. Then CDR would add 1 to get back the size... Just
          subtracted 1 in the appropriate spots in IDL compiler
          code. Checked out the new version in param_test and all seems to
          be ok. Thanks to Henrik Nordberg <hnordberg@lbl.gov> for
          reporting this bug.

Thu Feb 25 16:06:49 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: Added make commands to generate dummy *S_T.*
          files when building with Flick.

Thu Feb 25 15:53:13 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be
          TAO_IDL/driver: Changed the TAO_TRY macros with ACE_TRY macros
          in the IDL generated stubs and skeletons

Thu Feb 25 15:35:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (main): removed
          ACE_OS::thr_exit () call on VxWorks, because it's no longer
          necessary: the client doesn't die on shutdown.

Thu Feb 25 14:44:40 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.cpp: Fixed a typo, still another
          timeprobe error - not sure what was intended, will email
          doc_group.

Thu Feb 25 12:41:08 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/Orbix: Updated the Makefiles to use
          the newer dependencies.  Thanks to Uma Markandu
          <umam@nortelnetworks.com> for reporting this.

Thu Feb 25 11:38:48 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.cpp (parse_args): Still allow the use of
          -ORBdemuxstrategy but spit out a warning when used.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Don't remove
          temporary files on Win95/98.  Thanks to Rod Joseph
          <rodjoseph@adt.com> for reporting the problem.

        * docs/Options.html: Added a short note about the change of
          -ORBdemuxstrategy.

Thu Feb 25 09:27:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp: Use interpretive marshaling by
          default, at least until unions work correctly.

Wed Feb 24 23:21:53 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECConsumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Multiple/CosECSupplier.cpp: added #include
          <ace/Get_Opt.h>

Wed Feb 24 22:54:59 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.i (_svc_conf): This new function allows user to
          overwrite TAO_DEFAULT_*_ARGS settings at application's main
          without recompiling TAO library.  Notice these settings are
          further overwritten by external svc.conf files because svc.conf
          files are parsed before these fake entries.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf: -ORBdemuxstrategy
          has become -ORBsystemidpolicydemuxstrategy now.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static: Fixed
          static service's names.  Changed to use
          -ORBsystemidpolicydemuxstrategy.

        * tao/orbconf.cpp: Fixed TAO_DEFAULT_*_ARGS.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/default_client.cpp:
        * tao/default_server.cpp: Corrected names of the static services.

Wed Feb 24 17:08:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Conjunction_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp:
          Fixed explicit template instantiations.

Wed Feb 24 16:01:53 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp: Fred and I fixed up Location Forward logic in
          do_static_call ().  It wasn't advancing the profiles when a
          location forward message was returned.

Wed Feb 24 14:13:03 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/index.html: Added a link to
          $ACE_ROOT/docs/exceptions.html.

Wed Feb 24 11:45:29 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added a test for multiple profile forwarding.  This test
          verifies the Stub methods by duplicating the forwarding and
          request handling logic in wrappers.
          tests/Multiple_Profiles/forwarding.cpp

Wed Feb 24 11:40:08 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Stub.cpp - changed goto two_way to goto one_way

Wed Feb 24 11:07:32 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Updated how forwarding is performed so that multiple profiles
          are used.  This following files were modified.  These is still
          an issue with concurrency since the Stub object is responsible
          for managing the profile list and forwarding information.
          IIOP_Profile.cpp
          IIOP_Profile.h
          Invocation.cpp
          MProfile.cpp
          MProfile.h
          MProfile.i
          Pluggable.cpp
          Pluggable.h
          Stub.cpp
          Stub.h

          encode.cpp

Tue Feb 23 20:10:52 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Added EC_ObserverStrategy to the set
          of files for Event2

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ConsumerAdmin_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp: Implemented delayed
          and/or immediate removal and additions from the ConsumerAdmin
          internal set (of ProxyPushSupplier). This is important to
          applications that use reactive dispatching and can generate
          disconnections and/or connections to the EC as part of the
          consumer upcalls.  This strategies require condition variables
          and thus the use of templates to parametrize the locking
          strategy.  I also added a simple policy to control the level of
          concurrency in the ConsumerAdmin set: the user can specify how
          many threads can be concurrently running on the ConsumerAdmin.
          If this limit is exceeded then the new threads must wait until
          all the other threads leave.  At that point the delayed
          operations are executed.  This strategy ensures that operations
          are not delayed forever; setting the HWM to 1 (the default)
          ensures that operations are executed before the next upcall;
          setting the HWM to a very high value results in maximum
          concurrency; this could be a reasonable options if periodically
          there are periods without any activity.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ObserverStrategy.cpp: Added missing destructor.
          Minor cosmetic changes.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp: Added reference counting to
          this objects.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Busy_Lock.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Busy_Lock.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Busy_Lock.cpp: A simple adapter that conforms
          to the ACE_Lock interface. It invokes the busy() and idle()
          method on another object to acquire and release.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.h:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.i:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Command.cpp: Implemented two simple Command
          objects that can invoke the connected_i() and disconnected_i()
          methods on another class, this are useful to implement the
          delayed connection and disconnection from the EC.

        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Null_Factory.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp: Use the new EC_ConsumerAdmin
          types with the right locking strategies.

        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.h:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer_Driver.h:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.h:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier_Driver.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier_Driver.h:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
        * tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.h: The test is more flexible
          wrt event types subscribed by each consumer and published by the
          suppliers, this could be useful to measure how the test scales
          with the number of consumers and/or suppliers.

        * orbsvcs/RtecEventComm.idl:
        * orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp: Minor cosmetic changes.

Tue Feb 23 19:44:20 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_root/root.cpp: Added context state.
          Thanks to Mason Taube.

Tue Feb 23 18:11:11 1999 Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Callback_Quoter/Callback_Quoter.dsw:
          examples/Callback_Quoter/Notifier.dsp:
          examples/Callback_Quoter/Consumer.dsp:
          examples/Callback_Quoter/Supplier.dsp: Changes due to the
          removal of the ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE directive from the stubs
          and skeletons generated by the tao_idl compiler.  This directive
          caused compiler errors using MSVC 5.0. It went through when
          compiled with MSVC 6.0.

Tue Feb 23 16:53:14 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp (run):
          removed old comment that server shutdown would cause a
          memPartFree on VxWorks.  It no longer does.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Globals.{h,cpp}
          (sched_fifo_init): removed SCHED_PARAMS_FIFO macro, because it's
          not needed, fixed name of program in comment.

Tue Feb 23 15:24:46 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/cdr_op_cs.cpp: Fixed some more
          g++ warnings in generated code. It was unused arg in the case of
          the union and an unnecessary ACE_NOTREACHED in the case of the
          objref. If g++ is going to complain now about this, we might
          need to add it to the list in the #define of ACE_NOTREACHED.

Tue Feb 23 11:48:15 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (start_client_stubs,
          start_server_skeletons): removed #pragma once directives because
          they do not make sense in .cpp files, plus they don't work with
          MSVC 5.

Mon Feb 22 20:34:02 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

Mon Feb 22 14:27:44 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: Added rules to compile IDL files using Flick.
          You need to invoke a Makefile with "use_flick=1" command line
          flag.  Thanks to Tim Stack <stack@aros.net> for sending the

          Added some ACE_UNUSED_ARGs to prevent g++ 2.7.x from warning
          about unused arguments.

Sun Feb 21 21:48:12 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA: Changed TAO_TRY macros to ACE_TRY macros.

          TAO_MProfile::get_current_profile() to always return a value -
          warning turned up in VC 6.0.

Sun Feb 21 16:38:15 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

          #includes with <>'s in the idl files. Thanks to Mark Little
          <M.C.Little@ncl.ac.uk> for pointing this out.

Sun Feb 21 09:07:38 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Driver.cpp (dump_results): fixed
          64-to-32 bit conversions so that they operate on the 64-bit
          quantity directly, instead of a quotient.  And, divide by a
          float instead of an int, to use floating point division.  Thanks
          to Souhad Mcheik <mcheiks@inrs-telecom.uquebec.ca> for reporting
          that the code attempted to convert an unsigned 64-bit integer to
          a double.  That's not supported by MSVC++ 5.0.

Sat Feb 20 21:09:49 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

          Made changes to the TAO_TRY macros

Sat Feb 20 15:55:01 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile: moved TAO_IDLFLAGS override to after
          includes, so that any settings in platform_macros.GNU are not
          lost.

Sat Feb 20 000:28:57 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/InconsistentTypeCodeC.h: Added title and description to the
          class header.

Fri Feb 19 23:12:58 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp: Updated to
          the new request arg manipulation functions.  Commented out
          cube_union for the present until compiled marshaling gets
          finished for unions.

Fri Feb 19 22:53:19 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/Pluggable: Began to add support for CORBA operation
          calls that can timeout.  Thanks to Kevin Royalty
          <kroyalty@mdc.com> for suggesting this.

Fri Feb 19 21:52:45 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: The Twoway_Invocation class was re-fetching
          the profile and transport objects *after* sending the
          request. But during a nested upcall the transport hint in the
          current profile can change (if an invocation over the same
          object reference is required).  The solution is to keep a
          reference to the transport object in the stack and pass it down
          to the invoke_i() method of the GIOP_Invocation class.  Thanks
          to Hans Horsmann <Hans.Horsmann@icn.siemens.de> for reporting
          this bug.

Thu Feb 18 20:07:10 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_factory.cpp: Added missing context states
          in the TAO_Compiled_Visitor_Factory for servant implementation
          files Thanks to Mason Taube <taube@westcon.prc.com> for bringing
          it to our notice.

Thu Feb 18 17:28:43 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/dynany_test/Makefile: Fixed a line that needed to
          start with a tab. Thanks to Hakan Kallberg <hk@simulina.se> for
          reporting this.

Thu Feb 18 00:50:10 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MProfile.cpp: Need to include MProfile.i here when not
          inlined.

Wed Feb 17 17:57:01 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP_ORB.cpp MProfile.cpp MProfile.h ORB.cpp Stub.cpp Stub.h
          Stub.i decode.cpp MProfile.i Inlined many of the MProfile
          methods Also, changed MProfile so it could assume ownership of a
          profile, thus saving a lock.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.cpp: I added an strategy
          to support the Event Channel observers. The Event Channel uses
          this strategy to implement the append_observer(),
          remove_observer() methods and it informs the strategy of any
          changes in the set of consumers and/or suppliers.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl: The operation
          remove_observer can also raise a SYNCHRONIZATION_ERROR exception

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.h: Added a typedef for the
          HeaderSet iterator.

Tue Feb 16 17:15:12 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/vb.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/ab.{h,cpp}
          Defined a new VideoBuffer () class for the Video buffering
          process and AudioBuffer class for the audio buffering process
          and used the reactor for i/o handling instead of blocking i/o
          calls. Also uses a socketpair between the control process for
          exit notifications which eliminates the SIGUSR* signals. Also
          replaced the exit () calls with reactor end_event_loop so that
          the processes exit cleanly.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/Command_Handler.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/mpeg_client/vd.cpp: Replaced
          the SIGUSR signals code with socket notification code.

Tue Feb 16 16:48:28 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp} (print_exception): Added this method to
          print out the exception type in a human readable form.  This is
          not CORBA compliant and should never be used directly in user
          code.

        * tao/Environment.cpp (print_exception): Changed to use _narrow to
          determine if we have a SystemException or not.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (location_forward): Changed to use
          ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION.

Tue Feb 16 16:45:38 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Fixed warning due to unproper use of ACE_TRY
          macros, this time the warning was *very* significant.

Mon Feb 15 21:22:55 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

Mon Feb 15 17:24:52 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Invocation.i: replaced all the TAO_TRY macros with their
          ACE_ equivalents.

Mon Feb 15 16:24:42 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/CDR/Makefile:
        * tests/CDR/allocator.cpp: Added a new test to measure the effect
          of using TSS allocators in the CDR streams.

Mon Feb 15 13:26:29 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.4 released.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_compiled_cs.cpp:
          Jeff's changes are now valid only for the "inout" paramater and
          not to the "out" parameter.

Mon Feb 15 09:11:27 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument.h: Jeff had forgotten to
          #include the newly added files that he mentioned in his
          ChangeLog below. Due to this, we wre getting compile errors.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_argument/post_docall_cs.h: Once
          again, Jeff had forgotten to add the visit_string method to the
          class declaration, although he had provided the implementation.

Sun Feb 14 18:29:50 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_operation/arglist.h: Added
          post_invoke string_free() for INOUT and OUT strings, and
          release() for OUT objects, to plug a leak found with Purify.
          Added the compiled marshaling version classes for this as well.
          Changed the spot where post_invoke lines are generated, plus
          some other cosmetic fixes.

Sun Feb 14 12:41:55 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp:

          removed.

Sat Feb 13 17:52:01 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Server.cpp,
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp),
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp: Changed the following to
          make the time returned in units of 100 nanoseconds instead of
          seconds.

Sat Feb 13 01:11:52 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server/Property_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server/augmented_server.cpp:
          Replaced the _env environment variable usages with the
          TAO_IN_ENV parameters.

Fri Feb 12 22:04:31 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Event_Channel.i: Added new methods to
          create the locking strategies in the ProxyPushConsumer and
          ProxyPushSupplier.  The Null_Factory uses
          ACE_Lock_Adapter<ACE_Null_Mutex>, the Basic_Factory uses
          ACE_Lock_Adapter<ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX>.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxySupplier.cpp: The
          ProxyPushSupplier uses the new locking strategies.  A couple of
          private _i methods were added to avoid dead-locks.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Dispatching.cpp: The dispatching
          strategy receives the consumer object reference from the
          ProxyPushSupplier, otherwise it has to make an upcall and incurs
          in a dead-lock.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp: Minor cosmetic
          changes.

          and I may have missed a file or two. I'll build what I can

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.{h,cpp}
          tao/ORB.cpp
          tao/Stub.{i,cpp} Modified Stub and IIOP_Profile creation to use

          A. Janello <argon@mcs.net> for reporting this performance
          problem.

        * Modified tao/Stub.i to not print warning messages with a
          forwarded request is itself forwarded.  Since the multiple
          profile code and forwarding is still in development I left a
          debug message.

        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_Client_i.h
        * examples/Simple/Simple_util.cpp
        * examples/Simple/Simple_util.h: Made changes to use the name
          service.

Thu Feb 11 16:01:17 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp: Changed the ior_read () method
          to use ACE_Read_Buffer instead of fscanf (). Also ran purify on
          this. Got 0 memory leaks.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.h (class Clerk_i): Changed ior_fp_
          from FILE * to int. Used an ACE_HANDLE instead of FILE*.

Thu Feb 11 15:36:42 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.h: Fixed a g++ unused arg warning.

Thu Feb 11 15:29:20 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Exception.h:
        * tao/Environment.{h,cpp}: Unprotected private members and add
          exception id and major number to CORBA_Environment if
          TAO_USES_FLICK is defined.  Thanks to Tim Stack <stack@aros.net>
          for notifying us the change.

Thu Feb 11 15:28:49 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp: Fixed the g++ unused
          argument warnings. Thanks to Irfan for reporting this.

Thu Feb 11 15:12:08 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Forwarding_Servant.cpp (_primary_interface): Fixed the g++
          unused arg warnings.

Thu Feb 11 15:02:44 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/tao/idl_cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp:
          Fixed the g++ unused arg warnings.

Thu Feb 11 14:59:52 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosPropertyService.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AVStreams.idl:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Property/CosPropertyService_i.cpp : Fixed the
          problem with marshalling/demarshalling multiple exceptions. Also
          changed PropertyException from exception to struct the
          CosPropertyService.idl file, as suggested by OMG. But, AVStreams
          is not updated by OMG yet. All the instances of "raises
          CosPropertyService::PropertyException" in AVStreams.idl has been
          changed to "raises AVStreams::PropertyException". Thanks to
          Carlos for the great help in debugging exception marshalling
          problem. Thanks to Ulf <jaehrig@desys.com> for the bug report.

        * tao/tao.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Fixed Alpha Configuration.

Thu Feb 11 14:07:54 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/configurations.html: Changed the multi-thread,
          thread-per-connection example to Concurrency_Service.  Thanks to
          Terry Rosenbaum <Terry.Rosenbaum@Radiology.MSU.edu> for
          reporting this.

Thu Feb 11 11:28:44 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp: removed an extra #pragma
          from the file.

Thu Feb 11 11:23:05 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Interpreter.cpp: The GreenHills compiler (at least
          versions 1.8.8 and 1.8.9 of it) gets really confused by some
          template forward declarations. We had to re-arrange the includes
          to match the compiler liking.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp: Need to include ORB_Core.h in platforms
          that do not support svc.conf or when tao is using a static
          services.

Thu Feb 11 10:34:41 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Use of PHandle in MProfile.{h,cpp} create a name conflict.
          Added TAO_ to fix this.

        * Thanks to John Morey <jmorey@tbi.com> for reminding me of the
          ACE-Guidelines ;).

Thu Feb 11 02:51:34 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (ORB_init): Only initialize the ORB global variables
          _after_ the ORB has been initialized.  Otherwise, the
          init_orb_globals() will create a server_strategy_factory (as TAO
          is now) before we have a chance to initialize it.  This bug was
          causing grief in POA registration test. Thanks to David
          A. Janello <argno@mcs.net> for reporting the bug.

Wed Feb 10 23:50:11 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp (handle_input): It is unfotunate that an
          exception (probably a system exception) was thrown by the upcall
          code (even by the user) when the client was not expecting a
          response.  However, in this case, we cannot close the connection
          down, since it really isn't the client's fault.  Thanks to Mark
          L. Boriack <mboriack@std.saic.com> for helping in tracking down
          this problem.

Wed Feb 10 23:15:27 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp : Fixed a bug for the service
          not working on NT with files. The initialization of the
          ACE_Array_Base was not being done in the right place.  Thanks to
          Souhad Mcheik <mcheiks@inrs-telecom.uquebec.ca> for reporting
          this.

Wed Feb 10 22:16:01 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Fixed off-by-one error with
          calculating dynamic string length.

Wed Feb 10 19:39:27 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp: Using ACE_DEFAULT_TEMP_FILE for
          generating gperf input file. Thanks to Lothar Werzinger
          <lwerzinger@krones.de> for suggesting this.

Wed Feb 10 18:55:09 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Changed Stub.i, set_fwd_profiles () so it doesn't complain about
          fwd_profiles which are themselves forwarded.

Wed Feb 10 17:17:46 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp: I had to zero out the buffer to generate
          identical Typecodes on all platforms, including the padding
          bytes (which are now zeros). Thanks to Jim Crossley
          <JCrossley@mobsec.com> for chasing down the problems with this
          code and for suggesting that we test it out by comparing the
          output of different IDL compilers; this showed that the padding
          bytes were not initialized.

Wed Feb 10 16:36:41 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{i,cpp}: Streamlined the new arg manipulation helper
          functions.  They're now short enought to be inlined.

Wed Feb 10 14:22:34 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * rules.tao.GNU: Enabled the unused variable warning again. It
          compiles cleanly enough on Linux/EGCS.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/marshal_ss.cpp:

          Fixed bunch of warnings about unused variables.

Wed Feb 10 14:11:07 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Any.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/NVList.cpp: Added a method to Any called
          _tao_replace(). NVList method add_value() called
          Any::replace(). A bug report pointed out that, in the case where
          the Any arg to add_value() has been copy-constructed or assigned
          to, its value_ is 0, and replace() deals only with
          value_. _tao_replace is now called in add_value() if the value_
          of the Any arg is 0, and _tao_replace() uses the Any's message
          block instead. A simple test adapted from the bug report code
          runs ok now with no leaks. Thanks to Barry Hoggard for reporting
          this bug.

Wed Feb 10 13:05:17 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h (pdf): Moved struct
          Observer_Entry into the public part of the class to avoid
          problems with the SGI compiler.  Thanks to Eric Mitchell
          <emitchell@altaira.com> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 10 10:39:09 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.cpp: To use TAO_RETHROW the
          methods must use TAO_IN_ENV as the incoming CORBA_Environment
          argument.

        * tao/Typecode.i: Removed unused argument in kind()

Wed Feb 10 10:28:16 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp (add_ior):
          Fixed a warning by cxx.

Tue Feb  9 22:26:52 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.cpp,
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_LookupTable.h,
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Added the class IOR_LookupTable which
          is an abstraction over the Hash_Map_Manager to store the
          object_name -> IOR mappings that will be used by the
          resolve_initial_references ().  Updated the Makefile to include
          this class.

Tue Feb  9 22:11:08 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp: The generated
          code contained a variable that was not used in all cases. Now we
          only generate the variable if we actually use it.

Tue Feb  9 22:06:12 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.h: Added Title and description
          comments to the class declaration.

Tue Feb  9 21:40:29 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/examples/Event_Comm/*.cpp Changed all the TAO_* macros
          for exceptions to ACE_* macros. This went clean on SunOSC++.

Tue Feb  9 20:38:24 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/cdr_op_cs.cpp: Silenced pesky
          warning about unreached statement.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.cpp: Added new visitor to
          generate the variable declarations required for marshaling
          certain kind of fields.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_exception/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_structure/cdr_op_cs.cpp: Use the new
          visitor to generate field declarations.

Tue Feb  9 20:43:13 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * $TAO_ROOT/examples/Callback_Quoter/*.cpp Changed all the TAO_*
          macros for exceptions to ACE_* macros. This went clean on
          SunOSC++ and SunOSg++

Tue Feb  9 17:55:31 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corbafwd.h:
        * tao/Active_Object_Map.h:
        * tao/Any.cpp:
        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.h:
        * tao/IIOP_ORB.h:
        * tao/Marshal.h:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
        * tao/Object.cpp:
        * tao/Object.i:
        * tao/POA.h: Fixed several g++ errors and warnings, the main
          problem was that g++ could not cope with this code:

          class CORBA {
          public:
            int foo ();
            void bar (int x = CORBA::foo ());
          };

          I had to create two versions of the bar() method (actually
          ORB_init()).  It also had some problems with the order of
          definition of some inline methods (which I was able to solve)
          and it required the definition (not only forward declarations)
          of some templates before some templates could be instantiated.
          Overall a small set of re-arrangment of includes and
          declarations. We have to test in other platforms now.

Tue Feb  9 17:53:42 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/configurations.html: Changed the first entry under
          Homogeneous Systems to reflect the move of
          tao/orbconf.h/TAO_DISABLE_SWAP_ON_READ to
          ace/OS.h/ACE_DISABLE_SWAP_ON_READ.

Tue Feb  9 16:52:41 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp (gen_typecode): Thanks to
          Carlos. Fixed the problem with the typecode generation for the
          exceptions.

Tue Feb  9 16:39:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_decl.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_enum.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_enum_val.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_exception.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_field.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_predefined_type.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_structure.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_typedef.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_union_branch.cpp: The name2long() function was
          using a <long> but it needed a 32-bit type; the right type to
          use is a ACE_UINT32.  This fixes some strange problems in 64-bit
          machines, like Alphas.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp: Fixed
          the ACE_DEBUG calls, they should be protected by the
          TAO_debug_level.

Tue Feb  9 13:47:37 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h: Changed the definition of TAO_IN_ENV to
        ACE_TRY_ENV


Mon Feb  8 17:09:03 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/debug.h:

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
        * tao/Stub.cpp:
        * tao/deep_free.cpp:
        * tests/NestedUpcall/Reactor/client.cpp: Removed all the
          references to dmsg(), dmsg1(), dexc() and similar debugging
          macros, that's what we have ACE_DEBUG() for!!

        * performance-tests/Thruput/TAO/client.cpp:
        * tests/Multiple_Inheritance/server.cpp: Another couple of files
          that relied on "tao/corba.h" to include "ace/Get_Opt.h"

Mon Feb 08 15:20:09 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h:
        * tao/corbafwd.h: On NT we need to define DEBUG when _DEBUG is
          defined, but this definition was left on corba.h by mistake, now
          it is in corbafwd.h

        * tao/Invocation.h: MSVC++ doesn't know that a class and a struct
          are the same thing, and it complains when a structure is forward
          declared as a class; silly

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.cpp: MSVC++ gets confused by
          typedefs inside classes again.

        * tao/ORB_Strategies_T.cpp: Added missing #include.

        * tao/debug.cpp:
        * tao/debug.h: Fixed some #include problems.

Mon Feb  8 15:25:00 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/echo/Makefile,
        * examples/Simple/echo/client.cpp,
        * examples/Simple/echo/server.cpp,
        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_i.cpp: Replaced old TAO_TRY macros
          with ACE_TRY macros
        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_Client_i.cpp,
        * examples/Simple/echo/Echo_Client_i.h: New files after removing
          Server_i.* and Client_i.*

Mon Feb  8 14:26:29 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynAnyC.cpp,
        * tao/Object.cpp: Added missing #include for template
          instantiations.

        * tao/ORB.cpp,
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Re-ordered includes, otherwise
          "ace/Dynamic_Service.h" does not have the proper context.

          Cleaned up the include madness, now all the files inside TAO
          include "tao/corbafwd.h" to obtain the CORBA namespace. This
          files includes very little (only "ace/CDR.h" and
          "tao/orbconf.h"); so it is lighter than including "tao/corba.h".
          External applications only need to include "tao/corba.h", as
          before, but this file has been trimmed down somewhat.
          There are still some dependencies between several header files
          in TAO (specially "tao/ORB_Core.h"), but this are minor compared
          to the previous situation.

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.cpp:
          This files make changes to the IIOP_Profile so they need to
          include "tao/IIOP_Profile.h" explicitly, notice that all the
          other files in TAO do not need to.

        * examples/POA/Default_Servant/server.cpp:
        * examples/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp:

          This files used the "fact" that "tao/corba.h" included
          "ace/Get_Opt.h".

        * All the Makefiles in TAO where updated.

Mon Feb  8 12:16:33 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_obj_sequence_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_obj_sequence_cs.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_unbounded_obj_sequence_cs.cpp:
          Changed to generate ACE_TRY_ENV instead of TAO_IN_ENV.

Mon Feb 08 00:52:18 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.3 released.

Mon Feb  8 00:00:02 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Makefile:
          Some binaries did not link both NavWeapC.o and NavWeapS.o, this
          is needed for colocation support.

Sun Feb  7 23:45:19 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Updated makefile dependencies in
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier

Sun Feb  7 22:31:01 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP_ORB.cpp, poa declared twice.

Sun Feb  7 21:35:17 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Stub.i - added initialization for type_id
          from arg repository_id.

Sun Feb  7 20:01:29 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.i (STUB_Object): Fixed warnings about repository_id
          being unused.  Thanks to David for reporting this.

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp: Added some checks for failed memory
          allocation.

Sun Feb  7 16:57:55 1999  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/Simple_util.cpp
        * examples/Simple/time/Time_Client.cpp
        * examples/Simple/time/server.cpp
        * examples/Simple/grid/Grid_Client_i.cpp
        * examples/Simple/grid/server.cpp
        Changed TAO_TRY macros to ACE_TRY macros

Sun Feb  7 15:30:34 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp:
          Changed a line in is_equivalent(). The lhs of a ==
          operator comparing two Versions was actually a
          pointer to a Version.

Sun Feb  7 14:32:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DOVEBrowser.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DOVEBrowserApplet.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DemoCore.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/MTDataHandlerAdapter.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumerFactory.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/make.bat : strategized
          browser concurrency: can either use direct orb upcalls (default)
          or use queueing in active data handler adapter objects
          (via the -queue command line switch).

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{cpp, h}
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.{cpp, h}:
          fixed shutdown to ensure disconnection of the scheduler and EC
          servants, deregistration of these from the Naming Service.  Also
          added command line switches -n and -w to set the number of
          usec slept before generating each navigation or weapons event,
          respectively.

Sun Feb  7 11:44:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:
          Fixed the -Gi parsing code, it was setting compiled marshaling
          to 1, it must be 0.

Sun Feb 07 11:19:13 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: changed #include protection
          from #if !defined to #ifndef.  This allows compilers that
          recognize the #ifndef ... #define ... #endif idiom
          to optimize their reads of #include files.

Sun Feb  7 01:06:58 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
          Yet another extraction operator for CDR streams (for
          CORBA::Char*).

Sun Feb  7 00:52:36 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/ECCM_Consumer.dsp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/ECCM_Supplier.dsp:
          Changed the tao_idl.exe path to ACE_wrappers/bin.

Sat Feb  6 23:16:14 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp:
          Activated compiled marshaling by default. IRIX/MIPSpro and
          Linux/EGCS are happy, and so seems Solaris/CC; the old behavior
          can be invoked using the -Gi IDL compiler option, or by setting
          the TAO_IDLFLAGS environment variable to "-Gi".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/cdr_op_cs.cpp:
          A ACE_static_cast was used to remove constness, it should be
          ACE_const_cast.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/cdr_op_ch.cpp:
          Sometimes the array name is prefixed by an _, but the operator
          << and >> for CDR streams was generated by appending the _ to
          the complete name, not just the base name; this made the IRIX
          compiler very unhappy.

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
          Added the operator << for TAO_OutputCDR and "const CORBA::Char*"

Sat Feb 06 21:11:05 1999 Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * corba.h:
          Changed to reflect the renaming of the ACE filed to
          CDR_Stream.*

Sat Feb 06 20:41:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.dsp
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.dsw
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Logging_Sup.dsp:
          Redid NT project file for DualEC_Sup using MSVC++ 5.0, added
          dependencies for .\NavWeap.idl on ..\NavWeap.idl

Sat Feb  6 19:56:27 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Added << and >> operators for the TAO_*CDR classes; otherwise we
          get a lot of ambiguos definitions with the ACE_*CDR versions.

        * tao/orbconf.h:
          TAO_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES is enabled always, until somebody
          actually defines ACE_NO_COPY_OCTET_SEQUENCES.

Sat Feb  6 17:50:16 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/README:
        Fixed the problem with get_property_value passing IOR

1999-02-06  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Added an exit(1)
          when the preprocessor fails so that tao_idl doesn't hang.

Sat Feb 06 07:55:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

  (new) * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/MTDataHandlerAdapter.java:
          Adapts data handler to be an active object that processes events
          enqueued by another thread.

Sat Feb 06 07:33:19 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode): removed break statement following
          a return, because some compilers claim that it's not
          reachable.

Sat Feb 06 01:20:53 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf: No need to
          specify THR_BOUND since it is now the default.

        * tao/default_server.cpp (TAO_Default_Server_Strategy_Factory):
          Made THR_BOUND the default thread flags.

Fri Feb 05 21:59:12 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.{h,i,cpp}:

        * tao/Any.{h,i}::
        * tao/Invocation.cpp:
        * tao/Connect.cpp:
          The leveraging of the ACE CDR classes into TAO. Compiles
          cleanly on VC, suncc and g++. Both the ACE and the TAO
          CDR tests are working fine.

Fri Feb 05 21:23:33 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.3.2 released.

Fri Feb  5 19:44:40 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * release.chk:
          Cleared all the marks, the file was not up-to-date.

Fri Feb  5 18:45:36 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.i:
          Rearranged order of declarations.

Fri Feb  5 18:11:33 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/MProfile.cpp
          Fixed set () so it would reinitialize the list of profiles.

Fri Feb 05 16:55:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README: Documented DualEC_Sup.

Fri Feb 05 16:05:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumerFactory.java:
          Added -dualECdemo switch that resolves the appropriate event and
          scheduling service names for the DualEC_Sup supplier.

Fri Feb  5 15:56:31 1999  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/server.cpp:
        Added the fixes suggested by jaehrig@desys.com regarding
        CORBA::Any scopes to all the from_* and to_* methods of Any
        variables.
        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/README: Added this file

Fri Feb 05 15:55:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.{cpp, h}:
          Changed to generate navigation, weapons events from separate threads

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Logging_Sup.cpp:
          fixed a problem valuing the wrong data structure

Fri Feb  5 15:25:56 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Changed IIOP_Core.{h,cpp} and IIOP_ORB.cpp to use
          ACE_INET_Addr in the hash map rather than ACE_Addr.

Fri Feb  5 14:45:25 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * MProfile.{h,cpp} Added descriptive comments and fixed several
          cases of mixing int's with unsigned int's.

Fri Feb  5 14:21:33 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_ORB.cpp:
          Fixed problems in the parsing of URL style IORs.

        * tao/IIOP_Profile.cpp:
          Added some comments for Fred.

Fri Feb 05 13:15:00 1999 Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/DemoCore.java
    (new) TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/MTQueue.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/NavWeapDataHandler.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumerFactory.java
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/make.bat : reorganized
          DOVE browser to accept events from multiple named event channels,
          using a set of named schedulers.  Synchronized the data handler,
          added threaded queueing adapter to do early demultiplexing of ORB
          upcalls onto data handler threads.

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/NavWeap.idl
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{cpp, h}
    (new) TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DualEC_Sup.{cpp, dsp, h}

          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Logging_Sup.{cpp, dsp}
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Makefile : reorganized
          supplier infrastructure to be able to define an EC and scheduler
          per supplier proxy instance.  Added a new supplier, DualEC_Sup,
          which creates two event channels and two schedulers, then generates
          events and sends them over two channels.

Fri Feb  5 11:12:04 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

          The generated stubs were using IIOP_Object to access the CORBA
          object's underlying stub object. However, since the IIOP_Object
          class is now removed, we use the STUB_Object class.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Timer_Module.h:
          The Event Channel can receive a reference to the scheduler in
          its constructor, this reference is propagated to all the modules
          and used instead of the Scheduler_Factory singleton.
          This can be used to have more than one Event Channel for process
          or to simplify the testing of multiple Scheduling services.
          If no scheduler is specified the Event Channel bootstraps from
          the Scheduler_Factory as usual.

          It doesn't use the Scheduler_Factory anymore, this illustrates
          how the EC can receive the scheduler as an argument.


Fri Feb  5 02:33:05 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:
          Fixed explicit template instantiations for the new collocation
          map, it may not work correctly though.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Custom_Marshal/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

Thu Feb 04 23:42:39 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Stub.cpp: It should now include Stub.i instead of
          STUB_Object.i.

        * tao/TAO[_Static].dsp: Removed IIOP_Object and added MProfile.

Thu Feb  4 22:18:13 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * added public destructor to TAO_IIOP_Profile

Thu Feb  4 21:33:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * utils/catior/catior.cpp:
          It included $ACE_ROOT/tao/IIOP_Profile.h explicitly, the file
          has been removed. I'm not sure if the program will work, but at
          least I could update the Makefile dependencies.

Thu Feb  4 19:18:51 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Multiple Profiles (MP).
          This required the modification of several files, deleting others
          as well as adding and removing classes.

        * Removed the files IIOP_Object.{h,i,cpp} and object IIOP_Object.
          All functionality now resided in the old base class STUB_Object.

        * Changed many files and classes to multiple profiles or to
          account for removing the IIOP_Object class.

           1) IIOP_Connector.cpp
           2) IIOP_ORB.{h,cpp}
              IIOP_ORB.cpp changed references from IIOP_Object and
              Client_Handler to STUB_Object and TAO_Transport.  Also
              moved much of the IIOP specific marsheling code to IIOP_Profile.
           3) Invocation.{h,i,cpp}
              Changed references from IIOP_Object to STUB_Object.
           4) ORB.{h,i,cpp}
           5) ORB_Core.{h,i,cpp}
           6) Object.{i,cpp}
           7) Servant_Base.cpp
           8) Server_Request.cpp
           9) Stub.{h,i,cpp}
              All logic from IIOP_Object (minus transport specific stuff) moved to
              the STUB_Object.  Also the MProfile class is used for storing all
              profiles.
          10) decode.cpp
              Changed IIOP_Object ref to STUB_Object
          11) encode.cpp
              Changed IIOP_Object ref to STUB_Object
          12) Any.h
              Changed "friend class IIOP_Object" to "friend class STUB_Object"
          13) corba.h
              Added #include's for the Multiple Profile header files.

Thu Feb  4 15:07:29 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * updated MT_Cubit/svc.conf to use THR_BOUND as the default.

Thu Feb  4 14:34:43 1999  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/mpeg_server/Globals.cpp: Added the
          initialization of a missing member variable.  Thanks to Phil
          Ruelle <Phil.Ruelle@adv.sonybpe.com> for the fix.

Thu Feb 04 10:55:28 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Strategies_T.cpp (activate_svc_handler): Fixed unmatched
          ACE_TRACE message.

Thu Feb  4 00:02:17 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Made sure _WIN32 doesn't get redefined.  Thanks
          to Terry Rosenbaum <Terry.Rosenbaum@Radiology.MSU.edu> for
          pointing this out.

Wed Feb 03 15:01:22 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (open_services): Do not try to parse the
          default svc.conf file is TAO_PLATFORM_SVC_CONF_FILE_NOTSUP is
          defined.  You can still use the -f command line option to open a
          specific svc.conf file.

Wed Feb  3 12:17:02 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Disjunction_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Disjunction_Filter.cpp:
          Accepts an event if any of its children does.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Type_Filter.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Filter_Builder.cpp:
          This Filter_Builder can use the new filters to support basic
          filtering and correlation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Basic_Factory.cpp:
          A sample configuration based on the filtering above.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Filter.cpp:
          Use a RB_Tree to represent the set of event types required by a
          set of filters; this will let us implement the matching of
          consumers and suppliers more effificiently [O(nlog(n))]

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_ProxyConsumer.cpp:
          Call unbind() on the SupplierFiltering strategy, so it can
          release our resources.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_SupplierFiltering.cpp:

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.h (send_request): commented out argument
          names to avoid g++ 2.7.2.3 warnings about unused arguments.

        * docs/configurations.html: removed note about TAO_ORBSVCS
          not being supported by orbsvcs/orbsvcs/tmplinst-orbsvcs.cpp.
          Thanks to Carlos, it is now supported.

Tue Feb 02 09:22:31 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (create_stub_object): removed unused local
          "orb_core".

        * tao/decode.cpp (decode): removed return and continue statements
          following breaks, because some compilers complain that
          they're unreachable.

        * tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp (do_sendv): added static cast of
          iov_len to size_t.  It avoids a compile warning about
          signed/unsigned comparison on g++/Solaris86.

Mon Feb 01 21:28:27 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        Added these two options to the tao_idl compiler.
        -in To generate #include statements with <>'s for the standard include
        files (e.g. tao/corba.h) indicating them as non-changing files.
        Thanks to Andreas Geisler <andreas.geisler@erls.siemens.de> for
        this suggestion.

        -ic To generate #include statements with ""s for changing standard

Sat Jan 30 18:30:50 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/compiler.html:
        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

        files as servant implementation templates

Sat Jan 30 16:28:57 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.cpp:
        renamed variables named "ppc" to "proxypushconsumer" to fix the
        compile errors on Green Hills cross-compiler 1.8.8 for PowerPC.

Sat Jan 30 14:26:41 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added a new option -ORBInitRef to the ORB. The syntax is
        -ORBInitRef <ObjectID>=<IOR: ....  >.

        The option works for the IOR formats understandable by the
        string_to_object (). The string_to_object () will be modified later to
        understand other ior formats like iiopname, iioploc.

        The new option takes precedence over the current methods of resolving
        an initial reference to an arbitrary object ID
        (through resolve_initial_references ()).

        * tao/ORB.cpp  : Added a new function resolve_commandline_ref (). This
        function is called by the resolve_initial_references () to resolve a
        reference to an arbitrary object id specified in the -ORBInitRef param.
        * tao/ORB.h : Added the declaration for the above method.
        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp : Added the new option -ORBInitRef in init (). Also
        set the init_ref parameter if this option is specified.
        * tao/params.h : Added a new parameter init_ref_. Also added declarations
        for the Get/Set methods of init_ref_.
        * tao/params.i : Defined the Get/Set methods for the init_ref_ parameter.
        * tao/params.cpp : Added the constructor initialization of the init_ref_.

Sat Jan 30 11:55:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf.cpp
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf_Anomalies.cpp
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf_Anomalies_Runtime.h
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf_Runtime.{cpp, h}: updated
          types that had been changed in RtecScheduler.idl.  Thanks to gwross
          <gwross@west.raytheon.com> for providing this ix, which solves a
          compilation problem with MSVC++ 6.0.

Sat Jan 30 10:08:17 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/Generic_Servant/Makefile:

          Thanks to Robert V. Head <rhead@virtc.com> for pointing this
          out.

        * examples/Event_Comm/Event_Comm_i.cpp:
          Fixed the instantiation pragmas. Thanks to Robert V. Head
          <rhead@virtc.com> for pointing this out.

Fri Jan 29 20:16:45 1999  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/NVList.cpp:
          Changed add_value() to always copy the value of the Any,
          ignoring the CORBA::IN_COPY_VALUE flag. Calling replace(),
          as we did before, is faster, but if the value of the Any is
          0 (void* value is null), a crash will result. Thanks to
          Carlos for figuring this out and to Barry Hoggard for
          reporting the bug.

Fri Jan 29 18:07:28 1999  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

          SGI compiler

Fri Jan 29 18:04:25 1999  Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs,wustl.edu>

        * Fixed an old style ref to IIOP::MY_MINOR and IIOP::MY_MAJOR to
          TAO_IIOP_Profile::DEF_IIOP_MAJOR,
          TAO_IIOP_Profile::DEF_IIOP_MINOR in utils/catior/catior.cpp

Fri Jan 29 15:55:41 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
          I commited a version with support for the new Event Channel,
          this was a mistake, I'm reverting the change.

Fri Jan 29 09:07:47 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Sched_Conf/Sched_Conf.cpp: use
          RtecScheduler::Criticality_t, Importance_t, and Info_Type_T.
          Thanks to gwross <gwross@west.raytheon.com> for providing this
          fix, which solves a compilation problem with MSVC++ 6.0.

Thu Jan 28 21:36:38 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Updated the dependencies in all the Makefiles.

Thu Jan 28 20:49:56 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp: removed ACE_Hash<ACE_CString>
          explicit template instantiation, because it's in tao/POA.cpp.

Thu Jan 28 18:04:07 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:

Thu Jan 28 16:34:14 1999 Fred Kuhns <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added support for Pluggable Protocols (PP) This required the
          modification of several files, deleting others as well as adding
          and removing classes.

        * Added the following classes and files
          1) Pluggable.h - Contains all the base classes and registries
             used in Pluggable protocols.  New transport implementations
             will have
             to use these classes in order to 'plugin' to the framework.
             a) TAO_Profile
             b) TAO_Connector
             c) TAO_Transport
             d) TAO_Acceptor
             e) TAO_Connector_Registry
             Pluggable.cpp - Connector_Registry implementation and Profile
             Version class.  Each transport specific TAO_[*]_Connector
             registers itself with this singleton.
          2) IIOP_Profile.{h,cpp}
             Class TAO_IIOP_Profile is defined here and it profides IIOP
             specific processing.  Much of the transport specific
             processing located in the IIOP_Object has been relocated
             to here.
             In particular an IIOP_Profile will contain a reference to the
             currently used transport, that is the connection handler.
          3) IIOP_Connector.{h,cpp}
             All transport specific connection processing is hidden behind
             this class. The connection handler hint () is taken from the
             TAO_Profile (i.e. IIOP_Profile) object.
          4) IIOP_Acceptor - basically just a transport neutral wrapper
             for the Acceptor.

        * Changed many files and classes to use this new transport
          independent Pluggable classes.  Also relocated transport
          specific processing to the new classes.
          1) Connect.{h,cpp}
             Created new base classes TAO_IIOP_Client_Transport and
             TAO_IIOP_Server_Transport in order to keep TAO_Transport
             references and leverage dynamic binding.  That is, all
             handlers use either of these classes as a base class.
             TAO_SVC_HANDLER is a member object.

             Edited code so it passed TAO_Transport object references to
             GIOP::send_request and GIOP::recv_request.
          2) GIOP.{h,cpp}
             Replaced all references to the handler object with the new
             transport object.  Also moved all transport specific code
             used for reading and writing messages to the network to the
             new IIOP_Transport class.
          3) IIOP_ORB.{h,cpp}
             IIOP_ORB.h -> got rid of the #include "tao/corba.h"
             moved much of the IIOP specific marsheling code to IIOP_Profile.
          4) Invocation.{h,i,cpp}
             use TAO_Transport and TAO_Profile instead of Client_Handler and
             IIOP_Object::IIOP.
             Additionally, the connection is now made by the
             Connector_Registry object.
             All IIOP specific processing moved to TAO_IIOP_Profile.
          5) ORB.{h,i,cpp}
             The preconnect method's functionality is moved to
             Connector_Registry and TAO_[*]_Profile.
          6) ORB_Core.{h,i,cpp}
             The ORB_Core was changed to allocate memory for the new
             objects: TAO_Connector_Registry, TAO_IIOP_Connector and
             TAO_IIOP_Acceptor. Preconnect () moved also.
          7) Servant_Base.cpp
             Changed to use STUB_Object refs rather than IIOP_Object.
          8) Server_Request.cpp
             Changed to use STUB_Object refs rather than IIOP_Object.
          9) decode.cpp
             Moved all IIOP specific processing (parsing IORs) to
             IIOP_Profile.
         12) encode.cpp
             Moved all IIOP specific processing (parsing IORs) to
             IIOP_Profile.
         13) params.{h,i,cpp}
             Changed use_IIOP_lite_protocol to use_lite_protocol.
         14) corba.h
             Added #include's for the new Pluggable Protocol header
             files.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_pre_proc): Added a quick
          hack to open the tmp_file in the "correct" status on Win32 so
          the tmp_file will get removed automatically.

          We need to reimplement ACE_OS::fopen to make it behave the same
          as on other platforms at some later point.

          (DRV_copy_input): Changed to use ACE_OS::f* functions.  It
          doesn't really make any difference here because the temp file
          get closed before unlink.

          Added ability to check for a gperf program with a name other
          than "gperf."  This modification complements the change that
          was made to TAO_IDL/util/utl_global.cpp a few months ago that
          allowed TAO to use a gperf with a name besides "gperf."  As before,
          define the ACE_GPERF macro like so:
                         -DACE_GPERF=\"gperf-ace\"
          for example, to specify a perfect hash function generator called
          "gperf-ace."

          so that tao_idl won't crash when including 64 or more files.
          Thanks to Tommy Andreasen <tommy.andreasen@radiometer.dk>
          for reporting this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/export_test.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/import_test.cpp:
        Added the -iorfile or -i option to the export and import
        test. When provided a file name, the tests read the trader IOR
        from the file, else from standard input. Fixed some formating in
        the remaining files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.cpp:
        More "clever" uses of sequence buffers to avoid copying broke
        when the memory mangement of string sequences changed
        recently. Resorted to good, ol' fashioned copying. There shouldn't
        be any more of these lurking around.

Fri Jan 15 08:21:55 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.51 released.

Fri Jan 15 03:52:22 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/exceptions.html: Removed most entries in this file.  Added
          redirection to the new exception handling guideline page.

Fri Jan 15 01:47:41 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.50 released.

Fri Jan 15 00:35:24 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/run_test.pl : Added this perl script to test
        run the time service. The script offers options to run the service
        using either of the following :
          - Implementation Repository
          - Naming Service
          - Files
        The script runs only a single server because at this time I dont
        know how to start servers on different machines with the same
        script. Also the IR doesnt allow to run its multiple copies in
        the same directory because it writes implrepo.ior to the current
        directory.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/implrepo.conf : Added this file. This doesnt
        really belong here but anything which needs to run the IR needs
        this file.

Thu Jan 14 23:50:25 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo/usersguide.html:
        * docs/implrepo/index.html:
        * docs/implrepo/status.html:
          Added and collected most of the information on the
          Implementation Repository.  The main addition was a rough
          User's Guide which should help people use the IR.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
        * docs/index.html:
          Now point to the correct IR stuff.

Thu Jan 14 23:32:19 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/Makefile: Changed to incorporate the
        right path for Repository.o file. The make was throwing a link
        error.

Thu Jan 14 22:10:49 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h: Added comments to indication the macros in the
          file has been depricated.

Thu Jan 14 15:39:34 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp (check_unexpected_data): Only print the closing
          connection message when TAO_orbdebug is on.

Thu Jan 14 15:52:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

Thu Jan 14 14:07:17 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Request.{h,i,cpp}:
          Added the argument manipulation helper functions, as shown
          in the C++ mapping of ORBOS 98-09-03.

Thu Jan 14 11:51:31 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h,
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Service_Type_Repository.h: Changed a
          private: to public: to fix a problem on IRIX 6.4.  Thanks to
          Eric Mitchell <emitchell@altaira.com> for reporting this.

Thu Jan 14 02:46:56 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.49 released.

Thu Jan 14 00:52:48 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp (run): Added a new version of the run() method.
          This variant takes no timeout parameters and hence does not
          terminate the event loop if the Reactor returns a 0.  This
          variant is necessary for TAO to work correctly with Reactor
          implementations such as XtReactor that returns zero even when
          the timeout does not expire.

          Thanks to JM Strauss <jms97@club-internet.fr> for suggesting
          this change.

          Also, fixed the timeout by reference version of the run() method
          such that it no longer pretends to be dealing with const
          timeouts.

Wed Jan 13 14:56:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.cpp
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Logging_Sup.cpp: fixed string
          members of IDL structs by using .inout () to obtain lvalue.

Wed Jan 13 09:50:16 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp: removed ACE_Equal_To<ACE_CString>
          explicit instantiation because it's in tao/POA.cpp.

Tue Jan 12 20:10:16 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp (send_request): Changed to use sendv_n to do vector
          write.

Tue Jan 12 19:13:07 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
          fixed a seg fault that happened on program exit if <parse_args>
          failed. Now, <init_ORB> is called before anything else.

Tue Jan 12 18:04:33 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.i: Fixed a memory leak in bounded sequences.
          Thanks to Patrice Bensoussan <pbensoussan@amadeus.net> for
          helping us track this down.

Tue Jan 12 13:09:06 1999  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.{h,cpp}: Fixed some warning
          producing code.

Tue Jan 12 10:48:15 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.{i,cpp} (TAO_Unbounded_Sequence::operator[]):
          uninlined to avoid build (template instantiation) problems with
          Sun C++ 4.2 patch 104631-07.  Thanks to Magnus Karlsson
          <magnus.karlsson@syncom.se> for confirming that this solves the
          problem.

Tue Jan 12 08:46:42 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_scope.cpp:

          In the patch applied mentioned in the ChangeLog below, we were
          using the keyword "true" in a while loop. Unfortunately, it is
          not supported by SunCC. So we use the value 1 to represent a
          "true" value.

Mon Jan 11 22:56:26 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao_idl/include/utl_scope.h:
        * tao_idl/util/utl_scope.cpp:
          Added a patch sent in by Hamish Friedlander. This patch
          modified his previous patch (which enabled re-opening of
          modules) to further enable scoped lookups on these
          re-opened modules.

Mon Jan 11 21:20:23 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp (send_request): Fixed typos.

Mon Jan 11 19:40:25 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent:
          for all files in this directory -
          replaced TAO_TRY_ENV with TAO_IN_ENV

Mon Jan 11 16:55:57 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * IIOP: removed entire directory tree.

Mon Jan 11 16:36:08 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Added a section for the forthcoming Interface Repository

Mon Jan 11 13:15:15 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Changed the implementation to use the new send_n()
          method on SOCK_Stream.  This enabled me to be able to remove the
          adhoc use of writev_n() in this file.

Mon Jan 11 12:37:23 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Dereferenced the _var pointers in the following.
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init_IR):
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (create_server):

Mon Jan 11 02:10:05 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_THROW_ENV_RETURN): Forgot to removed
          duplicate definition.

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_CATCHALL): For compilers without c++
          exceptions, simply make it identical to TAO_CATCHANY.  Thanks,
          to Irfan for suggesting the change.

          functions.  This is an effort trying to simplify the use of TAO
          try macros.

        * tao/try_macros.h: Removed TAO_THROW_ENV_RETURN_VOID.  It's
          identical to TAO_THROW_ENV.
          Changed to use TAO_CHECK_ENV_RETURN and
          TAO_CHECK_ENV_RETURN_VOID to define TAO_CHECK_RETURN and
          TAO_CHECK_RETURN_VOID.

        * docs/exceptions.html: Added a section "In a nutshell" which
          covers 99% of the use case of TAO try macros.

Sun Jan 10 16:36:24 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the following to the Time Service.

Sun Jan 10 15:36:44 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Makefile: Added the following rule to make
        sure the ImplRepo_Service is uptodate.
        include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/rules.nested.GNU

        There would be no need for this once the files in the
        ImplRepo_Service are moved to the proper directories.

Sun Jan 10 02:57:26 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/DSI/Database_i.cpp: Fixed template instantiation
          problems and member re-ordereding problems.

Sat Jan  9 22:50:35 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp : Added the Implementation
        repository related functions. Made changes to incorporate the
        additional functionality required by the IR.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h : Addded member variables and
        functions required by the IR.

        The following files are required by the server. These files
        would have to be removed from here once the IR stabilizes and
        these files are put in a particular directory.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.cpp
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/IR_Helper.h
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/implrepo.conf

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Makefile : Changed the Makefile to link
        in the IR_Helper and other objects required by the Implementation
        Repository.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp
          (connect_push_supplier): Changed to use TAO_IN_ENV.

        * tao/try_macros.h: Added a new macro definition TAO_IN_ENV which
          maps to _env.  The purpose of adding this macro is to make the
          use of TAO try macros more readable.  From now on, we should
          always use TAO_IN_ENV to name the CORBA environment passed in
          from function arguments.  TAO_TRY_ENV should only be used within
          TAO_TRY block.

Sat Jan  9 14:53:15 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

          1. prefixed each class name with TAO_CosEC_
          2. changed all member *_ptr to *_var, removed calls to <release>.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp:
          1. <push> now uses an <EventSet> that does not own the buffer.
          2. ACE_NEW replaced with ACE_NEW_THROW.
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.cpp:
          ACE_NEW replaced with ACE_NEW_THROW.
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.h:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.h:
          Changed EventChannel_i to TAO_CosEC_EventChannel_i.

Fri Jan  8 15:05:08 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp.cpp:
          Further attempt to correct bug report by Ron Barack. I will ask
          Andy to check my changes.

Fri Jan  8 13:49:30 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Throughput.cpp (run): Changed to
          use TAO_CATCHANY and TAO_CATCHALL.

Fri Jan 08 13:10:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/clnt.cpp: added .out () to
          TAO_String_Manager idl structure fields that are being passed to
          strcpy calls.

Thu Jan  7 21:24:43 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp
          1. The parse_args method accepts Event and Source Ids from
             the command line.
          2. The scheduler has an option of being local or remote.
             (specifying remote does not work very well yet).
          3. added methods init_SupplierQOS  and init_ConsumerQOS.

        created the CosEC_Multiple test, added all these files:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEvent_Multiple.h
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEvent_Multiple.cpp
          Base class for test consumer and supplier implementation.
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECConsumer.h
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECConsumer.cpp
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECSupplier.h
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosECSupplier.cpp
        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile
        * orbsvcs/tests/README

Thu Jan  7 19:07:45 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_CATCHANY):  Don't treat the macro
          differently in either cases.  Simply reuse TAO_CATCH to catch
          CORBA_Exception.

Thu Jan 07 14:34:04 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/try_macros.h (TAO_CATCHANY,TAO_CATCHALL): Changed
          TAO_CATCHANY to catch CORBA_Exception or its subclasses only.
          Another macro TAO_CATCHALL was added to facilitate the use of
          "catch (...)".  TAO_CATCHALL translates to a no-op on platforms
          without native exception support.

          This change is aim to unify the error handling behavior of TAO
          programs on platforms with or without native exceptions.  "catch
          (...)" is evil anyway.

        * tao/Connect.cpp (handle_input): Changed to use TAO_CATCHANY and
          TAO_CATCHALL.

Thu Jan 07 07:16:29 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.cpp (svc): initialize local
          "priority" to 0 to avoid warning about uninitialized use
          from DEC cxx with DCE threads.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp (shutdown): fixed
          if (_env.exception () == 0) test to be
          if (_env.exception () != 0).  Thanks to Russ Noseworthy
          <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for providing the fix.

Thu Jan 07 05:07:33 1999  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.48 released.

Thu Jan 07 04:06:51 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Connect.cpp (check_unexpected_data): Made the checks for 0 and
          -1 from recv() the same. 0 is a graceful shutdown, while -1 is a
          somewhat ugly shutdown. Both will result in this function
          returning -1 and this connection getting closed.

        * Invocation.cpp (invoke): Added asserts to check for failures in
          resume_handler().

Wed Jan 06 16:44:06 1999  David L. Levine  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.2.47 released.

Wed Jan 06 16:16:40 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init_IR): added .in ()
          dereference to "time_service_server_".

Wed Jan  6 15:33:10 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * DynStruct_i.cpp:
          Even though this had already been fixed with respect to
          the latest compile problem, I noticed that the line in
          this file that contains ACE_Array_Base<> should be
          changed to something better that's already used in a
          couple of the other DynAny classes.

Wed Jan  6 15:29:10 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Commented out some IR related code for the build to go through.
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h (class Server_i):
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h:

Wed Jan 06 15:03:44 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/echo/Client_i.cpp (echo_list): added .in ()
          dereference to "ior".

Wed Jan 06 14:07:15 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Exception.{h,cpp} (TAO_DONT_CATCH):
        * tao/try_macros.h: Reverted my previous change about not using
          catch (...) on TAO_CATCHANY for debug build.  This "feature" is
          turned on only when you define TAO_DONT_CATCH_DOT_DOT_DOT.
          Thanks to Irfan for persuading me.

Wed Jan  6 13:44:29 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h (class Server_i): Addded the
        IR related code.

Wed Jan 06 13:29:04 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynStruct_i.cpp: removed ACE_Array_Base<CORBA_DynAny_var>
          instantiation because it's in DynArray_i.cpp.

Wed Jan  6 14:05:21 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ch.cpp:

          g++ was issuing warnings for the helper methods defined for
          arrays (e.g., _alloc, _dup, _copy, _free). These warnings
          appeared only when the helper methods were in the outermost
          global scope because they were defined static and the compiler
          could not find their implementation. Thus, we now do not
          generate the "static" keyword for these helpers if they are in
          the outermost scope. However, this change made Sun C++ compiler
          unhappy since it did not like the _free and _alloc in the inline
          file (*.i) and their forward declarations did not have the
          inline word. So now also generate the ACE_INLINE macro for the
          _free and _alloc methods if they are in the outermost scope. Now
          both compilers are happy. Hopefully others are too.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_ci.cpp:
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_cs.cpp:

          The var and out implementation was not guarded by the #if
          !defined conditionla. As a result, there were instances when we
          could get multiple definitions. Thanks to Virginie Amar
          <vamar@amadeus.net> for submitting the bugreport.

          We had also forgotten to set the "is_generated" flag to true
          once we had generated code for the sequence node.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_reset_cs.cpp:

          Since we now use the TAO_Object_Field_T<T> for object reference
          members of union, we couldn't call CORBA::release in the "reset"
          method. We now simply call "delete".

Wed Jan 06 11:55:25 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/echo/Client_i.cpp (echo_list): Changed <l> to of
          type Echo::List_var to free up the return value.  The returned
          string from object_to_string must be freed properly.

Wed Jan  6 09:31:16 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          The UDP_Receiver::init() method should only create the RT_Info
          if it is not there already. Thanks to Dave Meyer
          <dmeyer@std.saic.com> and J. Russell Noseworthy
          <rnosewor@objectsciences.com> for providing this fix.

Wed Jan 06 09:04:46 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * docs/releasenotes/TODO.html:
          Updated the information about EC related tasks.

        * docs/releasenotes/ec.html:
          Added the new features in the EC; removed the entries about a
          missing CosEventChannel, because we have one now!

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:
          Added some comments for Pradeep.

Wed Jan  6 07:44:24 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynStruct_i.cpp:
          Removed the last use (hopefully) of ACE_Array<>

Wed Jan 06 02:58:28 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_Examples.dsw
        * POA/Explicit_Activation/Makefile
        * POA/Generic_Servant/Makefile
        * POA/Generic_Servant/server.dsp
        * POA/Loader/Loader.dsw

        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/On_Demand_Loading.dsw
        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/server.dsp

          - Changed the name of the Generic Servant dynamic library from
            MyFoo back to Generic_Servant.  This was causing too many
            things to break on NT since the original settings were based
            on the Generic_Servant name.

          - Removed excess include directories in the make setting.

          - Fixed NT make files (including release settings) and made them
            conform with the existing makefiles.

        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Activator.cpp
        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Locator.cpp
        * POA/Loader/Servant_Activator.cpp
        * POA/Loader/Servant_Locator.cpp
        * POA/Loader/Server_Manager.cpp

          - Removed access includes files.

        * POA/On_Demand_Loading/Servant_Manager.cpp: Fixed use of ACE_CString.

Tue Jan  5 22:36:54 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/default_server.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}: We also need to define/declare static
          services for platform without svc.conf support.

Tue Jan  5 18:27:26 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp (init): Added the IR related
        code.

Tue Jan  5 17:44:53 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynAnyC.h
        * tao/DynAnyC.i
        * tao/DynSequence_i.h:
        * tao/DynStruct_i.h:
          Removed some other uses of ACE_Array in favor of ACE_Array_Base,
          in these cases there was no need for the operator== and/or
          operator!=

Tue Jan 05 15:40:20 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp (init_orb):
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Cubit_Task.cpp (initialize_orb):
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp (init):
        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Server.cpp (init):
          Removed explicit call to <TAO_Internal::open_services> when
          building static lib version on Win32 since we can now use them
          as static service (and configure them thru svc.conf.static
          file.)

        * performance_tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf.static:
        * performance_tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/svc.conf.static: Added two
          example svc.conf files to show how to use static services.

        * tao/orbconf.h: Changed the format of XXX_FACTORY_ARGS strings for
          platforms without svc.conf support to a single char string.
          These entries should look like this now:

           "static TAO_Foobar_Factory \"-ORBsettings a -ORBset b\""

        * tao/TAO_Internal.{h,cpp}: Removed method open_services which
          takes separate argument lists for each of the TAO default
          service.  Service initialization is now done in a more general
          way.

Tue Jan 05 14:32:11 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.i (_narrow): _narrow must increase the reference
          count on the object.  Thanks to Ron Barack <rab@terminal.cz> for
          reporting this bug.

Tue Jan 05 14:21:57 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp (open_services): Added insertion of
          default static service objects of TAO.  I forgot to do that.

Tue Jan  5 13:06:12 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/Client_i.cpp (withdraw): Removed the
          cast and used the .in () method instead. This would probably
          fix the error on DU cxx.

Tue Jan 05 07:57:40 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Simple/bank/Client_i.cpp (withdraw): added in ()
          dereference of except->reason.  Thanks to Andy for figuring
          out how to get this to compile now.

        * performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Cubit_Client.cpp,client.cpp,
          MT_Cubit/Task_Client.cpp: removed VxWorks #ifdefs that disabled
          ORB shutdown, because it no longer causes a MemPartFree with
          last night's remove () fixes to ace/Synch.

Tue Jan 05 04:51:02 1999  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:
        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/default_server.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}: Added definitions for static service
          objects and enabled TAO to use static services if
          TAO_USES_STATIC_SERVICE is defined.  This will allow platforms
          that doesn't support dynamic linking to change TAO's behavior at
          run-time.

Mon Jan 04 17:48:17 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.cpp (for_suppliers):
          Fixed typos.

Mon Jan  4 16:52:08 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the following project files for Time Service on NT.
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service.dsw
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service_Clerk.dsp
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Time_Service_Server.dsp

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Time_Service_Test.dsw
        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Time_Service_Test.dsp

        * orbsvcs/tests/Time/Client_i.cpp: Changed the TAO_CATCHANY to
          TAO_CATCH (SystemException, sysex). The former somehow wasn't
          catching CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT on NT.


Mon Jan  4 16:30:27 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/private_ch.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_access_cs.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_assign_cs.cpp:
        * tao_idl/be/be_visitor_union_branch/public_ci.cpp:
          Implemented TAO_Object_Field_T<foo> in place of foo_ptr
          for objects inside a union, so that _upcast() and
          _downcast() will work.

Mon Jan 04 16:08:49 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/Event_Channel_i.cpp (for_consumers):
          added missing ; at end of statement.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: with GreenHills gcx, added -w to CCFLAGS
          to suppress many warnings about TAO_YY_BREAK statements being
          unreachable.

Mon Jan  4 14:29:49 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_str_sequence_ci.cpp:

          For the [] operator, instead of returning a
          TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager, we were generating
          TAO_String_Manager.

        * tests/Param_Test/objref.cpp
          tests/Param_Test/ub_objref_seq.cpp:

          There were instances of incorrect assignment between a
          String_var and a TAO_String_Manager.

Mon Jan 04 12:45:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Runtime_Scheduler.{cpp, h}
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Utilities.{h, i}: added
          ACE_NEW_THROW_RETURN, lots of comments.

Mon Jan 04 12:04:37 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/*
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
          Another code review for Pradeep.

Mon Jan  4 07:39:27 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.cpp:

          The code was written with the assumption that a string member of
          a struct gets mapped to CORBA::String_var. However, due to the
          recent changes made to the IDL compiler where a string member
          gets mapped to a TAO_String_Manager caused several problems in
          the Trader code. This happened when the string member was
          assigned directly to a CORBA::String_var class. The right way to
          do this is to use the "in ()" method on the TAO_String_Manager
          class to retrieve the underlying string.

        * tao/Managed_Types.h
          tao/ORB.h:

          I had forgotten to include the Managed_Types.i file when the
          ACE_INLINE macro is defined. This was causing all kinds of
          undefined symbol errors at link time. However, it turns out that
          the Managed_Types.i file uses operations such as
          CORBA::string_free that get used before their inline definition
          is seen in ORB.i. The solution to this dependency problem is to
          include Managed_Types.i after ORB.i in the file ORB.h.

        * tao/{Sequence, Sequence_T}.{i,cpp} (operator []):

          Moved the definition of the [] operator to the *.cpp file since
          it was using the inline constructor of the
          TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager before it was defined.

        * tao/Managed_Types.i:

          Some missing ACE_INLINE added.

Mon Jan 04 00:15:13 1999  Darrell Brunsch  <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service/ImplRepo_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/ImplRepo/IR_Helper.cpp:
          Updated to work with recent changes to the ORB (specifically the
          IIOP_Object constructor and ORB_Core::addr()).

Sun Jan 03 23:05:08 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO_Static.dsp:
        * tao/TAO.dsp:

          Added Managed_Types.cpp to build.

Sun Jan 03 22:42:22 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): moved "/2" out of
          the ACE_U64_TO_U32 conversion, because dividing an ACE_U_LongLong
          by an int results in an ACE_UINT32.

Sun Jan  3 22:01:37 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp:
          Used rebind () instead of bind (). Because servers dont handle ^C,
          once bound contexts stay bound till the Naming Service is up.
          This was already being done for clerks. Commented out the IR part.
          Fixed warnings in init() and run() methods.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h:
          Added some comments. Also commented out the IR part, so I could
          fix the warnings pointed out by David and check the files in.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp:
          Added some comments. Commented out the IR part. Removed warnings
          for unreferenced variables

Sun Jan 03 21:39:49 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp (encode_sequence_to_string): Removed extra call to
          isascii().  It's followed by an isprint(): if byte is printable,
          then it must be ascii.  Thanks to David Levine and Chris
          Cleeland for helping with this.

Sun Jan  3 21:10:42 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Addded a new function to check if it is the first server or clerk.
        If it is then get a new context and bind it to the Name Server.
        The subsequent servers and clerks will bind to this context. The
        way this was being done previously is by clearing the exception
        and checking the return value of NamingContext::resolve (). Was
        working fine on Solaris but threw an exception on NT. I am now
        handling the exception appropriately. Also corrected a memory
        problem using CORBA::string_dup.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Server_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.h:

Sun Jan  3 20:30:00 1999  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: added TAO Scheduling Service section

Sun Jan  3 19:22:23 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.h:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/CosEvent_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/README:
        * orbsvcs/CosEvent_Service/Makefile:
          added the above files for the COS Event Service.

Sun Jan  3 18:56:51 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynSequence_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/DynStruct_i.{h<cpp}:
          Changed use of ACE_Array to use of ACE_Array_Base,
          to match Carlos' changes to DynArray_i.

Sun Jan  3 18:54:29  1999  Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/On_Demand_Loading.dsw:
        * examples/POA/On_Demand_Loading/"POA On_Demand_Loading Server.dsp":
          Added the NT workspace for the On_Demand_Loading example.

        * examples/POA/Loader/Loader.dsp:
        * examples/POA/Loader/"POA Loader Server.dsp":
          Added the NT workspace for the Loader example.

        * examples/POA/Generic_Servant/Server.dsp:
          Changed the settings of the project so that MyFoo.dll is produced as output.

Sun Jan  3 19:27:01 EST 1999  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@sahyadri.research.bell-labs.com>

        * tao/Managed_Types.{h,i,cpp}:

          Three new files added. These define and implement the various
          manager classes such as TAO_String_Manager,
          TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager that are required by the IDL to C++
          mapping for struct members that are strings and sequences of
          strings, respectively. We had to resort to two different
          managers because the managed type for sequence of strings must
          obey the value of the release data member of the sequence
          class. Other than this, the semantics are the same.

        * tao/ORB.h:

          Included the newly added Managed_Types.h file.

        * tao/{Sequence, Sequence_T}.{h,i,cpp}:

          Moved the TAO_String_Manager to the Managed_Types.* files. In
          addition, we now use TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager for the return
          type of the [] operator.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array.cpp (visit_string):

          Arrays of strings now use the TAO_String_Manager as its element
          type instead of CORBA::String_var. This was required to conform
          to the IDL->C++ mapping.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/field_ch.cpp (visit_string):

          Struct memebrs that are strings now use the TAO_String_Manager
          as its type instead of CORBA::String_var. This was required to conform
          to the IDL->C++ mapping.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/elemtype.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_str_sequence_ch.cpp
          TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_bounded_str_sequence_ci.cpp

          The generated code now produces TAO_SeqElem_String_Manager
          instead of TAO_String_Manager for the [] operator.

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html:

          Updated to reflect latest status. Also, removed some old
          comments that are no longer applicable.

Sun Jan  3 17:32:27 1999  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Vistors.cpp:
          Added some casting to fix some conversion warnings I was
          getting while rebuilding with VC5.

Sun Jan  3 13:12:27 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Added the TAO_ORBSVCS_Export macro to the following files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Server.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_TIO.h

Sat Jan  2 17:32:35 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.cpp:
          split the <init> method over 3 other  methods -
          <init_ORB>, <init_RtEC> and <init_CosEC>.

Sat Jan 02 11:15:48 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.cpp (obtain_push_supplier):
          added .in () dereference to rtecproxypushsupplier.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.cpp (obtain_push_consumer):
          added .in () dereference to rtecproxypushconsumer.

        * examples/Simple/grid/Client_i.cpp (test_grid): added
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG (ret_val) to avoid compiler warning with ACE_NDEBUG.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp (get_first_IOR): added
          .in () dereference to obj.

Fri Jan  1 23:31:48 1999  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/EventChannel_i.cpp:
          corrections to comments after code review.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ConsumerAdmin_i.cpp:
          using ACE_NEW now.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/SupplierAdmin_i.cpp:
          using ACE_NEW now.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushSupplier_i.cpp:
          uses ACE_NEW now, added a <connected> method,
          connect_push_consumer method throws AlreadyConnected and
          BAD_PARAM exceptions.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosEvent/ProxyPushConsumer_i.cpp:
          uses ACE_NEW now.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.h:
          changed method names to init,run and shutdown.
          corrections to comments after code review.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosEC_Basic.cpp:
          added checks for return errors.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECSupplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECSupplier.cpp:
          corrections to comments after code review.
          <disconnect_push_supplier> method now deactivates
          the Supplier object.

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/CosEC_Basic/CosECConsumer.cpp:

Fri Jan  1 18:11:07 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp : Used _duplicate ()
        on the server IORs. This overcomes the automatic deletion of memory.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp : Used the advance () method
        to iterate over the ACE_Array. The ACE_Unbounded_Set which was being
        used earlier did not require this method to be used.

Fri Jan 01 16:48:23 1999  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp (TAO_UTO): replaced cast
          with ACE_U64_TO_U32 macro invocation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp: added
          ACE_Array_Base<TAO_EC_Event> explicit instantiation.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Visitors.cpp: added
          a bunch of TAO_find explicit instantiations.

Fri Jan  1 13:33:33 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_UTO.cpp: Removed a ; at the end of a
          function. Digital Unix 4.0 was throwing a warning for this.

Fri Jan  1 12:29:28 1999  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile:
          Added the Time_Service directory.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.h:
        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/Timer_Helper.cpp:
          Use ACE_Array_Base instead of ACE_Unbounded_Set because it does
          not require an == or != operator defined.

        * tao/DynArray_i.h:
        * tao/DynArray_i.cpp:
          Use ACE_Array_Base instead of ACE_Array.

Fri Jan  1 11:51:42 1999  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

        Removed some VxWorks errors like 'TAO_TRY_LABEL unreferenced' in
        the following files.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_Time_Service_Server.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time/TAO_TIO.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time//TAO_UTO.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Time//TAO_Time_Service_Clerk.cpp:

Fri Jan 01 02:45:18 1999  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/array_ci.cpp (gen_forany_impl and
          gen_var_impl): There is no cast required for assigning a pointer
          to zero. Thanks to Patrice Bensoussan <pbensoussan@amadeus.net>
          for reporting this bug.

        * Active_Object_Map.i: Rearranged functions to remove "redeclared
          inline after being called" warnings.  Thanks to David for
          pointing these out.
