A simple test that verifies of TAO's endpoint-per-priority model
works.  This is a concurrency strategy where each endpoint is assigned
a thread running at a different priority. The priority of each
endpoint is transmitted to the client as a Tagged Component of the
IOR.  The client makes the request on the right endpoint to preserve
priority end-to-end.

	Check the run_test.pl script to check how this is used.
