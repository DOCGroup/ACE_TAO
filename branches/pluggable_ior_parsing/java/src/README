Make sure to update the environment variable CLASSPATH to include the
path to where java/classes/ is located. The Java compiler uses this to
find classes when resolving dependencies.

As with the C++ version of ACE, the Makefile requires GNU Make.

Suggestions are welcome to:

The documentation for Java ACE has not been included in the release
but can be automatically generated by typing "make doc" in the src
directory. Note that the gif images needed by the documentation ARE
included in the release.
