This test verifies that the "PICurrent" object semantics are correct
on both the client side and the server side.  In particular, it
attempts to make sure the request scope current (RSC) and thread scope
current (TSC) copying semantics are correct when transitioning between
the two scopes on both the client and server sides.  This is
accomplished by setting and getting elements of different types in the
RSC and TSC slot tables at various points during the course of an
invocation.

Expected output is along the lines of the following:

==== Running PICurrent test
PICurrentTest::test: <IOR:010000001b000000...>
(3384|3988) Extracted <46> from slot 0
(3384|3988) Client side RSC/TSC semantics appear to be correct.
(3960|1492) Inserted number <62> into RSC.
Test method invoked.
(3960|1492) Retrieved number <62> from TSC.
(3960|1492) String "Drink milk!" inserted into TSC.
(3960|1492) Retrieved "Drink milk!" from the RSC.
(3960|1492) Server side RSC/TSC semantics appear to be correct.
(3384|3988) Retrieved "Et tu Brute?" from the TSC.
