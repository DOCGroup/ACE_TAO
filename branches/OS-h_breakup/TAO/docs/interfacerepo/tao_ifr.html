<h3>
tao_ifr User's Guide</h3>

<h3> Overview</h3> tao_ifr is TAO's interface repository loader. When executed, it will first resolve the interface repository, either by finding the interface repository's IOR in a file whose name is passed to it through the -ORBInitRef command line option, or by IP multicast (the default). Note - if the -ORBInitRef option is used, it should come first on the command line, since it will be consumed when the ORB is initialized. Then it will create entries in (or remove entries from) the repository corresponding to the declarations found in the IDL file(s) passed to it. If an entry to be removed is not found the repository, nothing happens. As stated elsewhere in the documentation, if an entry to be added is found to already exist in the repository (that is, if the interface repository id is found by lookup), the old entry will be replaced by the new one. It is the user's responsibility to make sure that no entries are unexpectedly replaced in the repository. This is also the method by which interfaces forward declared but not defined in one IDL file are fully defined in another. If the old and new entries are both interfaces, there is no way for tao_ifr to know if this is the intention, or if there is a genuine name clash. The behavior shown by tao_ifr in this case was chosen to conform to the behavior of the interface repository loaders from other ORB vendors.

<h3><A NAME="options">tao_ifr Command Line Options</A></h3>

tao_ifr uses the front end of the TAO IDL compiler, which invokes your <tt>C</tt> (or <tt>C++</tt>)
preprocessor to resolve included IDL files.  It receives the common
options for preprocessors (such as <tt>-D</tt> or <tt>-I</tt>).  It
also receives other options that are specific to it<P>
