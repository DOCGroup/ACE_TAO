Kokyu is a portable middleware scheduling framework designed to
provide flexible scheduling and dispatching services within the
context of higher-level middleware. Kokyu currently provides real-time
scheduling and dispatching services for TAO's real-time Event Service
which mediates supplier-consumer relationships between application
operations. Kokyu also provides a scheduling and dispatching framework
for threads. This is being used by the TAO RTCORBA 2.0 scheduler
implementations. For more information, see

ACE_wrappers/Kokyu/docs/Kokyu.html

To build Kokyu on Unix systems, from under $ACE_ROOT/Kokyu do

make

To build Kokyu on Windows, open the workspace
$ACE_ROOT/Kokyu/Kokyu.dsw and build it.

An mpc file has also been provided - $ACE_ROOT/Kokyu/Kokyu.mpc from
which IDE specific build files can be generated.

Parts of Kokyu have been instrumented with DSUI. To enable this instrumentation,
first, you must have DSUI installed on your machine and the DATASTREAM_ROOT 
environment variable set. Next, you must modify Kokyu's mpc file so that the 
Kokyu project inherits from the dsui project, and the 'wrappers' lib must be 
added to Kokyu's libs (this can't be done in the dsui project because of 
ordering constraints) and $(DATASTREAM_ROOT)/include to the includes. Finally, 
you must add the kokyu_dsui_vars.cpp file to the Kokyu project's source file 
list and define the ACE_HAS_DSUI macro in Kokyu's dynamic flags. This should 
enable Kokyu's DSUI instrumentation.
