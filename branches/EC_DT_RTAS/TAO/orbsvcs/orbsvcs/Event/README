Parts of the Event Channel have been instrumented with DSUI. To enable this 
instrumentation, first, you must have DSUI installed on your machine and the 
DATASTREAM_ROOT environment variable set. Next, you must modify the mpc file 
for RTEvent so that the project inherits from the dsui project, and the 
'wrappers' lib must be added to the RTEvent project's libs (this can't be done 
in the dsui project because of ordering constraints) and $(DATASTREAM_ROOT)/include to the includes. Finally, you must add the kokyu_dsui_vars.cpp file to 
the the RTEvent project's source file list and define the ACE_HAS_DSUI 
macro in the RTEvent project's dynamic flags. This should enable Kokyu's DSUI 
instrumentation.
