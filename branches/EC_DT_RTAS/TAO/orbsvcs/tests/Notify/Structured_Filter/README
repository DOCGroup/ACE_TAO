Structured Event Filter Test
============================


Description
-----------

This test checks push supplier and push consumer event filter mechanisms.
The supplier sends a number of events specified by the consumer. The consumer 
can filter or not filter the events and can use multiple consumers.
If filtered, the consumer will receive 1/3 of the total events.


Usage
-----

The test consists of a Supplier and Consumer. The usage for each as is
follows:

$ Structured_Supplier 
usage:  ./Structured_Supplier -ORBInitRef <Naming Service Location> 

$ Structured_Consumer -\?
usage:  ./Structured_Consumer [-f] -n <num events> -c <num consumers> \
                -ORBInitRef <Naming Service Location>

The -f option applies an event filter to the consumer. The -c option lets 
the user specify the number of consumers to use.

To run this test, run the run_test.pl perl script. 


Expected Results
----------------
The test script will display an error if for any test that fails. 
Otherwise, the test passed.
