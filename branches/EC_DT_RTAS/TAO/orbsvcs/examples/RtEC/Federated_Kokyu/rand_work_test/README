To run the test, use the provided shell scripts (in the repository)
which run the 4 processes with the correct arguments:

./Node{1,2,3,4}

The order doesn't matter; they will synchronize themselves, but make
sure you delete all the IOR files between runs or they'll attempt to
read them before they are updated by the other processes!

Where:
norbert (Node1)
hermione (Node2)
harry (Node3)
ron (Node4)
