What: Supplier_EC, Consumer_EC

How: This test runs a single task which has multiple subtasks. T1_1 is
in Supplier_EC and you can have X other subtasks (where X is some
integer), each in its own separate instance of Consumer_EC. To do this,
you'll need to specify different IOR file names for each Consumer_EC,
like this:

`Consumer_EC -o iorfilename`

Then, once all the Consumer_EC's are started, start the Supplier_EC and
give it the filenames for all the Consumer_EC's. If there are 2
Consumer_ECs with IOR filenames "consumer1_ec.ior" and
"consumer2_ec.ior", then start Supplier_EC like this:

`Supplier_EC -i consumer1_ec.ior -i consumer2_ec.ior`

Note that to run with EDF instead of RMS (the default), you'll need
the '-s edf' flag just as with the RG test.
