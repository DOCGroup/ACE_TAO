What: Supplier_EC, Consumer_Supplier_EC, Consumer_EC

How: This test runs a single, 3-subtask task. Each subtask runs in a
separate process. First run Consumer_EC (for T1_3), then
Consumer_Supplier_EC (for T1_2), then Supplier_EC (for T1_1).

Note that to run with EDF instead of RMS (the default), you'll need
the '-s edf' flag just as with the RG test.
