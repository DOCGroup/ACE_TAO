KitchenSink Code Generation Test
===============================

This test is for correct code generation, the various
artifacts compile and link, but there is no executable.

The IDL file in this directory was put together to have
a wide variety of template-related IDL3+ constructs:

- template module
- use of template parameters in contained IDL declarations
- referenced template module usong 'alias' keyword
- instantiated template module

Currently only the TAO_IDL front end supports IDL3+
template-related constructs, so this test covers parsing
and AST building only. As implementation proceeds on
the corresponding back end support, code generation,
compiling and linking will also be tested.
