Messenger_StaticDAnCE.mpc

StaticDAnCEApp.cpp
------------------
copied from StaticDAnCEApp.cpp.tmpl in $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/StaticConfiguration

run_test.pl
-----------
a modified copy of the ../descriptors/run_test.pl script that uses the static
application in place of the NodeManager to run the Messenger_Node (port 44000)

To run the test on the target, start the Messenger_StaticDAnCE executable
(with -ORBEndpoint iiop://:44000) first on the target.
Then comment out the spawning of process NA4 in the run_test.pl script.
Also modify the final line of ../descriptors/ApplicationNodeMap.dat to
replace host with the hostname or IP address of the target system.

Known issues:
- During shutodwn the Execution_Manager will print out some exceptions when
it tries to communicate with the Messenger_StaticDAnCE process that has
already terminated.
