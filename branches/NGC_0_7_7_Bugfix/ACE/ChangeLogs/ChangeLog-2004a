Sat Jul 31 10:22:05 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/make_release:

	  WashU cvs is running a very old version of CVS which doesn't
	  support many of the old commands that we used to use. Retiring
	  those commands and set the working ones. 
	
Sat Jul 31 07:08:15 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/make_release:

	  Improved "wrong OS" error message so that it prints what it
	  believes to be the OS type.

Sat Jul 31 06:35:24 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* NEWS:

	  Added missing items for ACE 5.4.2.  Thanks to Olli Savia for
	  pointing out what was missing.

Sat Jul 31 05:47:31 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Release:
	* bin/make_release:

	  Changed the pattern for looking at borland makefiles.

Sat Jul 31 03:15:39 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Release: Include ACE.mwc which is very important.

Sat Jul 31 02:45:52 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/make_release:

	  Cosmetic changes to make the generated project and GNUmakefiles
	  look uniform.

Fri Jul 30 17:28:44 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* NEWS:  Added ACE 5.4.2 noteworthy items.

Fri Jul 30 23:29:17 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/make_release:

	  The chgrp on deuce.doc freaked out again. This check-in fixes
	  this problem using a hack. Cutting a beta on deuce.doc should
	  probably be avoided in future. We should be okay for this beta.

Fri Jul 30 19:18:08 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

 	* bin/make_release:

	  Added generation of Borland makefiles along with the
	  release. Thanks to Johnny for reminding me on this.

Thu Jul 29 18:19:17 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/config-irix6.x-g++.h:
	* ace/config-irix6.x-kcc.h:
	* ace/config-irix6.x-sgic++-nothreads.h:
	* ace/config-irix6.x-sgic++.h:

	  IRIX configuration updates that address compile- and run-time
	  errors.  Thanks to Kitty and Brian Waltersdorf
	  <brian dot j dot waltersdorf at boeing dot com> for supplying
	  the necessary changes and patch.

Wed Jul 28 00:09:08 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server-fancy.cpp (handle_events):

	  Fixed "comparison of signed and unsigned values" warning
	  exhibited by CBuilderX.

Tue Jul 27 07:11:50 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* Reverted change:
	  Tue Jun  8 16:27:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	  MPC generated Makefile.am's are not quite ready for the upcoming
	  beta.

Tue Jul 27 06:18:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.h:
          Reverted my change of yesterday, the Cygwin people made an error and
          have corrected it already, the workaround is not needed for Cygwin
          anymore. According to the Cygwin mailing list we could also have
          fixed this by adding -Wl,--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc as linker
          options, maybe this works also for MinGW, we should test this

Mon Jul 26 12:09:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* ace/Proactor.cpp: Add #include "ace/Auto_Ptr.h" to find auto_ptr<>
	  correctly on Visual Age C++.

Mon Jul 26 10:34:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.h:
          The latest version of the Cygwin binutils gives linker errors
          on the exported static members. The workaround we used for
          MinGW is now also needed for Cygwin.

Sun Jul 25 17:04:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tests/Dev_Poll_Reactor_Test.cpp (server_worker):

	  Removed extern "C" declaration for this function.  Sun C++ 5.5
	  whines about it.

Sun Jul 25 23:18:53 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Release:
	* bin/make_release:

	  Tag and bundle ACE_MPC along with the release. This seems to
	  work. Final stages of testing are on.

Sun Jul 25 22:16:27 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/make_release:

	  Fixed some simple mistakes which prevented the release form
	  happening.

Sun Jul 25 22:13:48 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Release:

	  Makefile with release information.

Fri Jul 23 16:08:21 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (accept): Added a check whether addr == 0
	  before calling a method on it.  Thanks to Heiko Nardmann
 	  <heiko.nardmann@secunet.com> for reporting this.

Fri Jul 23 10:19:00 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/Proactor.cpp (timeout):

	  Release the asynch_timer instance from the auto_ptr<> after the
	  completion has been posted and prior to exiting this method
	  successfully.  Once the completion is posted, the proactor
	  becomes responsible for managing the asynch_timer memory.
	  Addresses memory access violations revealed by a
	  Proactor_Timer_Test failure.  Thanks to Johnny for pointing out
	  the failure.

Fri Jul 23 11:38:26 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/make_release:

	  Changes to the make_release. This has not been tested
	  yet. Checking in to test it in a different repository.

Fri Jul 23 13:32:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/SOCK_Connector_Test.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect Id tag, the $ around was missing, therefore it
	  wasn't updated by cvs anymore.

Thu Jul 22 14:11:24 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/MFC_Log.cpp (log):

	  Fixed Unicode build errors caused by use of raw "char" string
	  instead of an "ACE_TCHAR" string.

Thu Jul 22 16:47:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* examples/APG/Reactor/HAStatus.cpp:
	* examples/APG/Reactor/HAStatus-AC.cpp: (from pg 151, 174) In
	  ClientService::handle_input(), the data was not copied to the
	  ACE_Message_Block, nor was the write pointer updated. Changed the
	  allocation to only specify the needed size, and then call
	  ACE_Message_Block::copy() to copy the needed data in. Thanks to
	  Jaroslaw Nozderko <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl> for
	  reporting this problem.

Thu Jul 22 16:12:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.cpp: Removed the call
	  to CWinAPp::Enable3dControls(). It's deprecated from MFC 5.0 on.

	* examples/NT_Service/ntsvc.cpp: Moved the schedule_timer() call from
	  the Service constructor to the svc() method. It's not needed for
	  simply installing and removing the service. Also, when the service
	  is to shut down, cancel the timer. Fixes a hanging handler crash
	  on shutdown. Thanks to Johann Kandlbauer <hkandl@gamed.com> for
	  reporting this problem.

	* THANKS: Added Johann Kandlbauer to the Hall of Fame.

Wed Jul 21 06:39:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added libs that must be build first in the msvc static builds

Mon Jul 19 21:11:18 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tests/Dev_Poll_Reactor_Test.cpp:

	  Added missing "ace/OS_NS_netdb.h" include directive.  Addresses
	  compile-time errors on our Solaris 8 build.

Mon Jul 19 17:40:15 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

	* ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (bind_i):

	  Adam Rymarczuk noted that crashes occurred while adding handles
	  to the Reactor when the pending additions exceeded what the
	  to_be_added set could hold.  Even though logically speaking
	  there was space available because there were several deletions
	  pending, we are out of room in the to_be_added set because the
	  Reactor event loop hasn't run in a while (the to_be_added and
	  to_be_deleted sets are not processed until some thread runs the
	  event loop).

	  The solution to fix the out-of-bounds write is to add the check:

		this->handles_to_be_added_ < this->max_size_

	  to the bind_i() method.

	  Thanks to Adam Rymarczuk <adam.rymarczuk@suntradingllc.com> for
	  reporting this problem.  This closes bug 1878.

Mon Jul 19 09:25:58 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/Proactor.cpp (timeout):

	  Fixed leaked ACE_Asynch_Result_Impl instance.  Thanks to
	  Fukasawa Mitsuo <fukasawa_mitsuo@nifty.com> for reporting the
	  problem.  [Bug 1879]

Mon Jul 19 06:38:00 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Instead of hard coding the makefile name, we use a new method on
          the WorkspaceCreator to get the current output name.  Also, when
          recursing into directories, pass the current makefile name as a
          parameter to make to ensure that we are sticking with the correct
          line of generated makefiles.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/kokyu_dsrt_scheduler_server.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/kokyu_dsrt_schedulers.mpb:

          Removed the project name from these base projects.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/client.mpb:

          Removed this file.  It is no longer referenced.

Sun Jul 18 11:33:58 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Birthday number 42!!

Sun Jul 18 09:08:42 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added new PolicyFactory test to the test run list.

Sun Jul 18 00:26:19 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/QtReactor.h
        * ace/QtReactor.cpp

          Changed QtReactor constructors to follow the way plain
          ACE_Select_Reactor is constructed.

        * tests/QtReactor.cpp
        * tests/QtReactor.h
          Reduced number of socket handlers for QNX NTO as Qt@NTO is
          compiled with small FD_SETSIZE.

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h
          Decreased FD_SETSIZE to 1000 to better follow QNX NTO limits.

Sat Jul 17 14:50:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_L_FIFO.{h,cpp,i}:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_Broadcast.{h,cpp,i}:
          Fixed compile errors in wchar build

Sat Jul 17 14:35:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_position_independent_malloc.cpp:
        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_persistence.cpp:
        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_malloc.cpp:
        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_multiple_mallocs.cpp:
          Fixed compile errors in wchar build

Sat Jul 17 12:32:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp:
          Replaced www.affa-az.com with www.dre.vanderbilt.edu, the first
          seems to be unavailable and this results in the failing of this
          test in our daily builds

Sat Jul 17 01:34:44 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/README (ACE_HAS_QT):
        Create section on ACE_HAS_QT and ACE_QTREACTOR_CLEAR_PENDING_EVENTS.

        * ace/QtReactor.cpp:
        * ace/QtReactor.h:
        Introduced ACE_QTREACTOR_CLEAR_PENDING_EVENTS switch to disable
        calling ACE_Event_Handler::handle_* for handles without activity,
        espacially for ACE_Acceptor::handle_input. see ace/README.

        * test/QtReactor_Test.cpp:
        * test/QtReactor_Test.cpp:
        Fixed bug related with bad interpretation of
        ACE_Acceptor::make_svc_handler. Modified some ACE_DEBUG.

Fri Jul 16 16:37:31 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ChangeLog: "Do not look at lazer pointer with remaining eye".

          Thanks to Russ Noseworthy
          <j.russell.noseworthy@objectsciences.com> for this deep thought
          ;-)

Fri Jul 16 07:27:56 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * tests/Makefile.am:
          Build UUIDTest.

        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added support for building UUID subset.

Thu Jul 15 18:57:55 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * tests/QtReactor_Test.cpp: Fixed acceptor bug for Windows Qt.
        Added few debug messages.

Thu Jul 15 07:01:15 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Removed ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_METHOD_SPECIALIZATION and added
          ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION checks.

          These feature-test macros are used to set ACE_TEMPLATE_METHOD_-
          SPECIALIZATION and ACE_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION as
          appropriate to accommodate the template specialization syntax
          required by different compilers.  The former is obsolete and
          has (mostly) been removed, the latter is used by TAO.

Wed Jul 14 10:10:24 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:

          Removed extraneous character that was inadvertently committed.

Tue Jul 13 22:51:53 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/Options.h (slave_name):

          Corrected return value of this method.  "const ACE_TCHAR *", not
          "const char *".

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/Options.cpp:

          Fixed mismatched wide string concatenation.

Tue Jul 13 06:21:23 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/APG/Processes/Spawn.cpp (doWork):

          Fixed mismatched format specifier warning.

Mon Jul 12 20:08:17 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:

          The sys_epoll interface was introduced in Linux kernel 2.5.45.
          Don't support backported versions since they appear to be
          buggy.  The obsolete ioctl()-based interface is no longer
          supported.  Issue a preprocessor error in those cases.

Mon Jul 12 19:51:21 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/APG/Reactor/Client.cpp (ACE_TMAIN):

          Addressed compile-time problems in "wchar" builds (generally
          incorrect conversion from wchar * to char * and/or vice versa).

Mon Jul 12 18:29:12 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
          When ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE is defined include
          ace/Unbounded_Queue. This should fix the errors in the SunCC 5.5
          build

Mon Jul 12 20:32:25 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fixed a bug with this change "Tue Jul  6 11:59:53 2004
          Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" which
          prevented any of the entries in svc.conf files from being read.

Sun Jul 11 20:26:17 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html
          Added MinGW and Cygwin to the list of environments Remedy supports

Mon Jul 12 01:31:53 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * tests/QtReactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/QtReactor_Test.h:
        * tests/tests.mpc:
          New automatic test for testing QtReactor. This test may also
          serve  as an example of Qt and ACE integration.

        * ace/QtReactor.cpp:
        * ace/QtReactor.h:
          Many bugfixes in QtReactor. QtReactor is operational now, though
          it should be rewritten to make it more efficient and improve the
          clarity of sources. Moreover, valgrind reports small memory leak
          in QtReactor_Test, though it's not clear now if the leak results
          from QtReactor or test code.

Sun Jul 11 16:48:12 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SOCK_Acceptor.cpp:
          Fixed compile error in commit of Douglas below

Sun Jul 11 10:52:06 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (shared_open): ACE_SOCK_Acceptor::shared_open()
          was binding its passive-mode socket to INADDR_ANY whenever a
          wildcard is specified for the port.  Fixed this so that it uses
          whatever the actual address is (which could very well still be
          INADDR_ANY).  Thanks to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kcarazi@finjan.com>
          and Ed Mulholland <emulholl@atl.lmco.com> for this solution.

Sun Jul 11 06:33:12 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added some projects that we must buld first in a static build before
          doing a full build

Sat Jul 10 10:18:30 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h:

          Clarified "context" parameter copying semantics.

Thu Jul 10 09:38:44 2004 Frank Hunleth <frank@hunleth.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_UCONTEXT_T for OpenBSD 3.5 and later.  Thanks to
          J.T. Conklin <jtc@acorntoolworks.com> for sending the patch over
          right after I upgraded to 3.5.

Sat Jul 10 09:37:34 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Added information on MPC for users who build from anon cvs
          repository.

Fri Jul  9 23:45:25 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.h (ACE_RB_Tree_Base::allocator):
        * ace/RB_Tree.inl:

          This non-template class method is now inlined in the RB_Tree.h
          header rather than in RB_Tree.inl since that file may be
          included multiple times when inlining is disabled and on
          platforms where ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE is defined.  In
          those platform/configuration combinations, multiple definitions
          of this method occured.  Placing the definition inline in the
          header avoids such errors.

Fri Jul  9 21:23:13 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.{h,inl,cpp}: Fixed a number of bugs pertaining to
          ACE_RB_Tree's failure to use its allocators correctly.  Thanks
          to Lothar Werzinger <lothar@xcerla.com> for these fixes.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h: Added macros for ACE_SOCK_DGRAM,
          ACE_SOCK_DGRAM_MCAST, and ACE_SOCK_DGRAM_BCAST so they will work
          on compilers like MIPSPro v.7.41 that don't support template
          typedefs.  Thanks to Brian Waltersdorf
          <brian.j.waltersdorf@boeing.com> for reporting this and
          suggesting a fix.

Thu Jul  8 16:00:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.h: If ACE_HAS_DEFERRED_TIMER_COMMANDS is
          set, #include "ace/Unbounded_Queue.h" and forward declare
          ACE_Command_Base, as these are needed later.

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/Bounded_Packet_Relay.mpc:
        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/Thread_Bounded_Packet_Relay.h: Moved
          the #define ACE_HAS_DEFERRED_TIMER_COMMANDS macro setting from the
          .h file to the .mpc file. Helps poor Visual Age C++ deal with it
          correctly when instantiating templates.

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/BPR_Drivers_T.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to pick up ACE_OS::memset().

Thu Jul  8 11:32:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace: Renamed config-aix-5.1.h to config-aix-5.x.h since it covers
          both AIX 5.1 and 5.2.

Thu Jul  8 08:56:53 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE.mwc:

          A workspace file ACE alone.

Thu Jul  8 01:09:32 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace: Renamed config-aix5.1.h to config-aix-5.1.h to be consistent
          with the other AIX config*.h files.

Wed Jul  7 21:26:00 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:

          Integrated updates from Jaroslaw Nozderko
          <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl> that replace old Linux
          /dev/epoll based implementation to latest sys_epoll API.

          Added missing header inclusions.

        * tests/Dev_Poll_Reactor_Test.cpp:

          Added missing "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h" include.

Wed Jul  7 06:31:30 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Reverted my generic target change from Thu Jul  1 14:00:09 2004.
          It caused make to invoke every workspace target twice.

Wed Jul  7 00:03:34 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_errno.inl: Clarified why ACE_OS::last_error()
          has a preference for errno.  Thanks to Lance Paine
          <lance@ams.co.nz> for motivating this.

Tue Jul  6 16:13:31 2004  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Added the new test for nsadd change.

        * THANKS: added Dave Knox to file.

Tue Jul  6 15:02:30 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Added Dev_Poll_Reactor_Test.

Tue Jul  6 11:59:53 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp: Reverted the following change.


          Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P4
          * ace/Service_Config.cpp: Insert component into repository before
            calling init as in the init the component may access the
            service repository.

          Dr. Schmidt opines that this change is wrong for the following
          reasons:

          (1) If the init () call returns a -1, the component should not
              be in the repository in the first place.

          (2) If the component is in the repository, there is a
              possibility that another application thread could access the
              component in the repository before the component is
              initialized.


           Unless we address the above concerns to satisfaction, this
           change cannot be added to the repository.

Tue Jul  6 12:03:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.cpp (parse_args): The inherited
          ACE_Strategy_Acceptor::service_port_ member was removed prior
          to ACE 5.3. Use a local variable instead. Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen for reporting this.

Mon Jul  5 11:45:34 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/UUID.cpp (ACE_Utils):

          Corrected syntax error in ACE_Thread_ID instance.

Mon Jul  5 10:40:59 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/UUID.cpp (ACE_Utils): Replaced the ACE_Thread_ID constructor
          with the new one that calls the ACE_OS::thr_self() methods.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.{h,cpp}: Added a new constructor to
          ACE_Thread_ID that calls the ACE_OS::thr_self() methods to
          initialize an object, rather than having to do this externally
          to the constructor.

Mon Jul  5 14:46:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Removed ACE_LACKS_SYS_MSG_H and added ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE_GETTIMEOFDAY
          to fix compile errors with Cygwin

Sun Jul  4 20:30:56 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp: There was some weirdness in the
          to_string() method, which should have been using the local data
          members for the thread id and thread handle, but instead was
          calling the OS functions directly...  Thanks to Michael Hollins
          <michael.hollins@silverbrookresearch.com> for reporting this.

Sat Jul  3 06:46:06 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
          #define ACE_HAS_UCONTEXT_T.  Addresses a compile-time error.

Fri Jul  2 17:54:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/Task_ThreadPool.cpp: Break out of
          Manager::svc() when getq() fails. Thanks to J.T. Conklin
          <jtc@acorntoolworks.com> for reporting this.

Fri Jul  2 10:42:00 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Based_Pointer_T.inl (operator->): Replaced the use of
          a C-style cast with a reinterpret cast.  Thanks to
          Rick Ohnemus <rick.ohnemus@systemware.com> for this fix, which
          closes bugid 1866.

        * ACE-INSTALL.html (HREF): Fixed a typo.  Thanks to
          Rick Ohnemus <rick.ohnemus@systemware.com> for this fix, which
          closes bugid 1867.

Thu Jul  1 17:03:40 2004  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_svnt.mpb:

          Updated to include files from the DAnCE directory.

Thu Jul  1 16:59:03 2004  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub:

          Updated to include files from the DAnCE directory.

Thu Jul  1 16:24:47 2004  Jaiganesh B  <jai@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client_dnc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb:

          Updated the mpb files to point to the
          new DAnCE directory.

Thu Jul  1 14:42:36 2004  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * etc/ciao_assembly_deployer.doxygen:
        * etc/ciao_componentserver.doxygen:
        * etc/ciao_daemon.doxygen:

          Fixed some reference error. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for reporting these bugs.

Thu Jul  1 14:00:09 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.rel:

          Reworded some comments.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed an unused variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a generic target that just passes the target on to the
          children makefiles.  This is the last target in the generated
          workspace to avoid problems with explicitly listed targets such as
          all, clean, realclean, etc.

          Also removed the deprecated "reverseclean" target.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added support for the new MPC 'postcommand' keyword for custom
          definitions.  See $MPC_ROOT/README for more details.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Changed the default INSLIB location from $(ACE_ROOT)/ace to
          $(ACE_ROOT)/lib.

Thu Jul  1 13:34:51 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h: Change the ACE_UINT64_FORMAT_SPECIFIER and
          ACE_INT64_FORMAT_SPECIFIER to depend on the value of
          ACE_SIZEOF_LONG. If long is an 8-byte type, then the 'l'
          format modifier is correct instead of 'll'. Fixes compile
          warnings from g++ in 64-bite mode. Thanks to Andre Kostur
          <akostur@incognito.com> for this fix.

Thu Jul  1 07:54:11 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl: Changed the thr_min_stack() wrapper method
          so it just calls the underlying OS function without using
          ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL.  Thanks to Mattias Nilsson
          <mattias.o.nilsson@ericsson.com> for reporting this bug and
          providing a fix.

Thu Jul  1 09:42:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * html/index.html:
          Fixed html tag so that ciao documentation is not on a lower level

Thu Jul  1 09:10:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          When Valgrind is set, don't add valgrind exe, this is done
          in PerlACE already

Wed Jun 30 10:56:21 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client_dnc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_component_dnc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_server_dnc.mpb:

          Use the DnC version of the libraries for linking and related
          tasks instead of the regular core libraries.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          removed 'dnc = 0' nonsense.

Wed Jun 30 08:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SString.cpp:
          To make things easier to maintenance use the new
          ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_STATIC_TEMPLATE_MEMBER_INSTANTIATION macro to check
          whether we need to explicit instantiate static template members.
          This macro is set for the GNU compiler for AIX, HPUX and VxWorks.

Wed Jun 30 06:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Removed usage of inst_close, inst_auto and inst_none. These control
          how templates are used, but this setup caused a crash in the HP
          assigner. I have check this on the aCC mailing list and it seems that
          these options are obsolete and shouldn't be used, the compiler is
          already capable at handling templates for a long time. I have
          done a test run with the HP aCC compiler without these options
          and then the crash in the assigner is gone and we don't got any
          other errors, so removed these options

Tue Jun 29 19:30:31 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h (mask_ops, mask_ops_i):

          Added return value documentation for these methods.

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (remove_handler_i):

          Corrected problem where error condition may be incorrectly
          detected in some cases.  Thanks to Jaroslaw Nozderko
          <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl> for pointing out the
          problem.

Tue Jun 29 08:36:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Compile fixes for unicode builds

Mon Jun 28 23:42:18 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h (ACE_HAS_NONCONST_MSGSND):

          LynxOS 4's msgsnd() function accepts a non-const "void *" buffer
          argument.  Addresses a compile-time error.

Tue Jun 29 06:08:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Jun 28 16:39:25 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Removed preprocessor conditional with identical contents
          for both cases.

Mon Jun 28 16:34:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: If wcstok() is detected, added a check for whether it
          has 2 or 3 parameters; set ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_WCSTOK if it's 3.

        * m4/subsets.m4: Added the Filecache, Metrics, and UUID components
          to the selectable subsets of ACE.

        * m4/config_h.m4: Added a template for ACE_LACKS_ACE_UUID and
          ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_WCSTOK.

        Note that I also removed the subset-building support from the MPC
        template for automake files. So, these subset-selecting options are
        still here as a placeholder for now, but will likely be removed in
        the future. If subset building is required, then more effort will
        need to be put into the automake support in MPC.

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
          Removed ACE_RUN_VALGRIND_OPT for valgrind. The easiest way
          to do this is to set the environment variable VALGRIND_OPTS and
          then valgrind will use these settings. This way the user can
          control all the options of valgrind, which options there are,
          see the valgrind documentation

Fri Jun 25 17:40:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.cpp (client): Specify AF_INET when
          giving both a port and hostname string. The listener was set up
          at IPv4, so make sure this one is as well. Fixes this test's failures
          when running on an IPv6-enabled system.

        * ace/Based_Pointer_Repository.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.h:
          Doxygen fixes

Fri Jun 25 07:56:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Timeprobe.cpp:
          Fixed explicit template instantiations

Thu Jun 24 08:55:49 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-lite.h (ACE_WIN32CALL_RETURN):

          Reverted usage of static_cast<> back to C style cast.  Some
          compilers on Windows fail to compile some ACE code when using
          the former.

          Removed conditional code enabled by ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES
          and ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES, as those macros have been
          obsolete for some time.

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added checks for ACE_LACKS_WCSCAT, ACE_LACKS_WCSCHR,

Wed Jun 23 17:31:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-lite.h: For ACE_OSCALL[_RETURN] macros, changed the
          static_cast back to a C-style cast. Not enough type information
          was known in all cases. Particularly, on HP-UX, the return value
          from shl_load() is a pointer to a struct, and the struct internals
          aren't known. This caused aC++ to refuse to do the static_cast.

Wed Jun 23 11:25:23 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Changed to not check for SysV IPC functions unless the
          cooresponding header files are present.  OS X does not support
          SysV IPC, but it's C library contains stubs for all the system
          calls (probably left over from the BSD libc).

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_msg.inl:
          Fixed case where C-style cast was being used to cast away const
          when it didn't need to.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_msg.inl:
          Removed conditional code enabled by ACE_LACKS_POSIX_PROTOTYPES
          and ACE_LACKS_SOME_POSIX_PROTOTYPES, as those macros have been
          obsolete for some time.

Wed Jun 23 11:24:39 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_macros.h:

          Missed one static_cast<> reversion in the Win32 case.  See the
          "Tue Jun 22 12:33:49 2004  Ossama Othman
          <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" ChangeLog entry for details.

Wed Jun 23 12:18:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.{h inl}: Added new method, fast_clear(), which
          sets the string length to 0. Doesn't release string-allocated
          memory, but if the memory was externally supplied, it is no
          longer referenced from the string object. Thanks to
          Sergei Kuchin <skuchin@mqsoftware.com> for contributing this
          method.

        * tests/SString_Test.cpp: Added smoke test for fast_clear().

        * THANKS: Added Sergei Kuchin to the Hall of Fame.

Wed Jun 23 14:51:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/footprint_stats.sh:
          Added strategies library and corrected locations of valuetype
          and rtscheduler library

Wed Jun 23 06:52:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lite.h:
        * ace/README:
          Changed ACE_HAS_MEMORY_PROFILER to ACE_INITIALIZE_MEMORY_BEFORE_USE.
          The last says better what we do. This define is then set when
          running with valgrind or purify. Thanks to Chris Cleeland for
          the suggestion

Tue Jun 22 16:54:35 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Changed ACE_HAS_LIMITED_RUSAGE_T and ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SETRLIMIT
          checks to include <sys/time.h> before <sys/resource.h>.
          Changed ACE_HAS_BROKEN_WRITEV check to use !ACE_LACKS_UNISTD_H
          instead of ACE_HAS_UNISTD_H (which is never set).

Tue Jun 22 13:54:36 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-macosx-panther.h:
        * ace/config-macosx.h:
          Changed to define only ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE_GETTIMEOFDAY.
          ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_GETTIMEOFDAY had also been defined.

Tue Jun 22 12:33:49 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_macros.h (ACE_SOCKCALL_RETURN):

          Reverted my change that turned the C style cast into a
          static_cast<> in the Win32 case.   ACE uses Win32 HANDLES (a
          void * type), and MSVC++ 6 won't accept a static_cast<> from a
          pointer type to an integral type.

          Renamed ACE_HAS_SUNOS4_GETTIMEOFDAY to ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_GETTIMEOFDAY.
          Changed canned SunOS 4 configs to use ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE_GETTIMEOFDAY,
          as SunOS wasn't changed to use a void * until SunOS 5/Solaris 2.

Tue Jun 22 13:57:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lite.h:
        * ace/README:
          I am testing with valgrind. This also detects unitialized memory
          like purify and in TAO we use ACE_HAS_PURIFY to explicitly
          initialize memory to prevent errors from Purify. To prevent that
          we check for different tools inside the TAO code, introduced
          ACE_HAS_MEMORY_PROFILER which will be used within TAO, this is then
          set when ACE_HAS_PURIFY or ACE_HAS_VALGRIND is set. If we need some
          more special things for the tools, we can easily set a new define
          based on ACE_HAS_PURIFY and ACE_HAS_VALGRIND.

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.h:
          Doxygen update

Tue Jun 22 12:49:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh:
          Also run the AMH_Single_Threaded performance test

        * html/Stats/detailed_performance.shtml:
          Added the AMH_Single_Threaded performance test. Now we can monitor
          the performance of AMH also. This is in preparation of some changes
          that add the ability to use allocators for the AMH Response Handlers
          which should have a positive effect on the performance. With
          AMH on the scoreboard we can monitor it directly.

Tue Jun 22 08:05:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pl:
          When using valgrind things go slower, so added code to set the
          delay factor, so that timeouts get longer. We start with 5, maybe
          that is enough. Also corrected the setting of the timeout for
          purify

Tue Jun 22 07:07:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pl:
          Added the option to use valgrind as memory test tool. This can
          be enabled by setting the environment variable ACE_RUN_VALGRIND_CMD
          to the valgrind version you want to start. If this is set, then
          valgrind is used with the default options "-q --leak-check=yes
          --trace-children=yes". This can be overruled by setting the
          environment variable ACE_RUN_VALGRIND_OPT, if that is set
          we use those options, if the default options are not complete,
          feel free to add new ones.

Mon Jun 21 23:19:38 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftorbutils.mpb:

          This base project requires minimum CORBA support to be disabled.
          Projects that depend on these base projects must be aware of
          this.  Added an "avoids += minimum_corba" entry.

Mon Jun 21 22:31:45 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/config-netbsd.h:
        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
          Changed to define ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE_GETTIMEOFDAY instead of
          ACE_HAS_SUNOS4_GETTIMEOFDAY.

Mon Jun 21 13:49:22 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_macros.h:

          Use a static_cast<> instead of a C style cast.  ANSI C++ casts
          are the preferred method of casting in ACE.

Mon Jun 21 13:37:57 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-lite.h:

          Removed versions of ACE_OSCALL and ACE_OSCALL_RETURN macros that
          restarted the given operation when ACE_HAS_SIGNAL_SAFE_OS_CALLS
          was defined.  That capability was never enabled by any of our
          supported platforms.  In fact, some parts of ACE would not
          function properly when that ability was enabled.  Furthermore,
          they assumed that ability to restart system calls was determined
          statically.  That assumption does not hold for modern platforms,
          where that ability is determined dynamically at run-time.
          Thanks to J.T. Conklin for pointing out the problems with
          defining ACE_HAS_SIGNAL_SAFE_OS_CALLS.

          These changes also fix a problem with self-assignment of the
          variable used to store the return value of an operation wrapped
          within an ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL macro (e.g. ACE_OSCALL_RETURN
          (ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL (..., ace_result_),...).  Thanks to Andrew
          G. Harvey <agh@cisco.com> for poiniting out the
          self-assignment.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_signal.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Updated ACE_OSCALL_RETURN(ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL()) macro calls to use
          a locally declared result variable instead of the one that
          existed in the ACE_OSCALL_RETURN macro.  The latter no longer
          exists.

        * ace/README:

          Removed documentation for ACE_HAS_SIGNAL_SAFE_OS_CALLS macro.
          It is no longer used.

Mon Jun 21 13:13:09 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Removed ACE_HAS_SIGNAL_SAFE_OS_CALLS test.  The macro has
          been deprecated.

Mon Jun 21 13:21:38 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.cpp (resize): Don't free() the existing buffer if
          release_ is 0. Caller controls the memory area and freeing it may
          be a very bad thing to do. The larger allocated area causes the
          release_ flag to be set to 1. Thanks to Kelly Hickel
          <kfh@mqsoftware.com> for reporting this.

Mon Jun 21 12:45:20 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_errno.h"
          so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS::set_errno_to_last_error().

Mon Jun 21 09:17:56 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (thr_create): Only try to close down the
          tmp_handle if it's not NULL.  Thanks to chdommreis@t-online.de
          for reporting this and providing a fix.  This fixes bugid 1859.

Mon Jun 21 11:56:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Enabled leak check and tracing of child processes for Valgrind.

Mon Jun 21 10:19:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Added new config Valgrind to be able to run the tests under
          Valgrind.

Sun Jun 20 22:09:58 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * m4/ace.m4 (ACE_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS):
        * tests/Makefile.am:

          Added support for conditionally building IPv6 tests.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp (TEST_ENTRY):

          Changed filename detected in test to one that always exists in
          configure-based VPATH builds (run_test.lst).  Addresses a
          problem where the test would fail since the file in question
          only existed in the source directory.  Thanks to J.T. Conklin
          for reporting this problem.

Sun Jun 20 23:35:05 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * doc/ACE-subsetting.html:
          Updated to reflect the current subsetting work we've been doing
          over the last year or so.  This is a first cut, and will be
          revised before the release.

Sun Jun 20 13:03:19 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/loadbalancing.mpb:

          TAO's load balancing service requries AMI support, not just the
          messaging library.  Added missing "requires += ami".

Sun Jun 20 12:33:11 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrteventchannel.mpb:

          The FTRT_EventChannel requires CORBA messaging support.  Added
          missing "requires += corba_messaging" to this base project.

Sun Jun 20 12:17:08 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrtevent.mpb:

          These base projects require minimum CORBA support to be
          disabled.  Projects that depend on these base projects must be
          aware of this.  Added an "avoids += minimum_corba" entry.

Sun Jun 20 18:27:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/ThreadManagement/Priorities.cpp:
          Replaced include of ace/OS.h with ace/OS_unistd.h and fixed typo
          in macro

Sun Jun 20 17:59:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TLI_Acceptor.cpp:
          Fixed compile warning in Tru64 build

Sun Jun 20 09:39:58 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:
          Changed to call gettimeofday() for timezone information on
          OpenBSD systems again, it turns out it does not export the
          global timezone variable.

Sun Jun 20 14:39:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/FILE.{h,cpp}:
          Removed deprecated position() set method, use seek()
          Removed deprecated position() get method, use tell()

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.{h,inl}:
          Removed the deprecated timer_queue() method that returns a
          reference

        * examples/Timer_Queue/Thread_Timer_Queue_Test.cpp:
        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/Thread_Bounded_Packet_Relay.cpp:
          Don't use the deprecated timer_queue() that returns a
          reference

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigInfo.cpp:
          Use ACE_OS::strerror instead of strerror directly.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/FILE_SAP/client.cpp:
          Don't use the ACE_FILE deprecated methods

Sun Jun 20 00:25:17 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:

        * docs/minimumTAO.html:

          This document doesn't belong in ACE. Moving it to TAO/docs.

Sat Jun 19 13:38:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigInfo.cpp:
          Use ACE_DEBUG to output a message that fork is needed, and
          don't include ace/streams.h, it is not needed

Sat Jun 19 13:29:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.h:
          Improved doxygen tags

          Changed checks for ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS with __ACE_INLINE__ in
          the h/cpp files. In the .i files changed ASYS_INLINE with ACE_INLINE.

Sat Jun 19 07:31:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp:
          Added missing include for non inlined builds

Fri Jun 18 18:36:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * docs/index.html: Changed title of the ACE-tutorial.pdf/ps link to
          say it's a tutorial, not the ACE programmer's guide, so as not to
          confuse this with "The ACE Programmer's Guide" (APG). Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for pointing out this confusion.

        * docs/ACE-tutorials.html: Removed. All of the pertinent information
          is on the index.html page.

Fri Jun 18 12:42:52 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:
          Changed GNU C version of readPPCTimeBase() so it can be
          inlined in ACE_OS::gethrtime() and compiled on Mac OS X
          where "r" register prefixes are required in inline asm.

Fri Jun 18 12:04:35 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ACE_INSTALL.html:
          Added description of --enable-ipv6 and --enable-ipv4-ipv6
          flags.

        * m4/ace.m4:
          Added --enable-ipv6 flag which sets ACE_HAS_IPV6.
          Added --enable-ipv4-ipv6 flag which sets
          ACE_USES_IPV4_IPV6_MIGRATION.

        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added ACE_USES_IPV4_IPV6_MIGRATION template.

          Updated some more URLs, and improved formatting of some text.

Fri Jun 18 11:49:23 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ACE-inheritance.pdf:
        * docs/ACE-inheritance.ps.gz:

          These are simply out dated files. Doxygen produces better
          things. Users should refer to doxygen and not this.

Fri Jun 18 10:12:47 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Updated ACE-INSTALL with information about a bunch of things
          related to MPC. Haven't updated anything about using MPC other
          than pointing out the documentation. Need to see what else
          should be added.

        * docs/msvc_notes.txt:

          Updated this file about the location of libraries.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Added documentation for the option stlport=1 which can be used
          in platform_macros.GNU.

Fri Jun 18 11:08:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lite.h:
          Removed setting ASYS_INLINE, we don't use it anymore, instead we
          use ACE_INLINE

Fri Jun 18 10:31:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Removed all commented out defines

        * ace/IOStream_T.cpp:
          Added include of ace/OS_Memory.h

Thu Jun 17 21:54:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/configure.ac:
          Changed ACE_LACKS_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS check to #include
          <sys/types.h> before <sys/un.h>; it is required by many
          systems.

Thu Jun 17 22:10:18 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Wheel_T.cpp:

          Fixed recalc_earliest() to remember the spoke with the earliest
          time not from the current wheel iteration.  If the entire wheel
          is searched and no earliest time from the current iteration is
          found, then the remembered spoke is the earliest_spoke_.  Thanks
          to Ken Descoteaux <ken@proquent.com> for this fix.  This fixes
          bugid 1853.

Thu Jun 17 12:48:09 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/configure.ac:
          Added small part of change:
          Wed Jun 16 16:00:52 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>
          that was not committed at the time.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:
          Changed to avoid use of gettimeofday() for timezone info
          on *BSD systems.  Changed to always call tzset() for all
          systems that get timezone info from global variable.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1845.

Thu Jun 17 09:19:45 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added checks for pthread_suspend(), pthread_suspend_np(),
          pthread_continue(), pthread_continue_np(), and pthread_
          resume_np() which set ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SUSPEND, etc...

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Changed to call pthread_suspend_np(), pthead_continue_np(), or
          pthread_resume_np() as appropriate, depending on the values of
          the above macros.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1839.

Thu Jun 17 09:43:49 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/ACE-porting.html: Updated this file so that it mentions
          CIAO and also provides additional information on porting
          logistics for people who want to contribute a port back to the
          DOC group.  Thanks to Thomas Rohner <thomas.rohner@hp.com>
          for motivating this.

Thu Jun 17 09:20:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/BPR_Drivers_T.cpp:
          Added missing include to fix compile error in HPUX build

Wed Jun 16 16:00:52 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added check for getifaddrs() which sets ACE_HAS_GETIFADDRS if it
          does not exist.

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/README:
          Added new config knob ACE_LACKS_RWLOCKATTR_PSHARED for those
          systems which support thread but not processes scope rwlocks.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1841.

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
        * ace/README:
          Removed check for pthread_suspend() and pthread_continue() in
          ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT test as these interfaces were not
          part of the Version 2 of the Single Unix Specification
          (aka UNIX98).
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1840.

Wed Jun 16 16:51:52 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.h: Changed include of os_include/os_pthread.h to
          OS_NS_Thread.h so ACE_mutex_t is picked up correctly on all
          platforms.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp:

        * ace/Flag_Manip.h: Added #include "ace/os_include/os_fcntl.h" to
          make the values for ACE_Flag_Manip available to callers.

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp:
        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp: Added #include "ace/Flag_Manip.h" and

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Dispatcher_Impl_T.h: Added #includes to pick up needed
          declarations for ACE_SYNCH_RECURSIVE_MUTEX.

Wed Jun 16 12:48:21 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (access): Fixed the ACE_HAS_WINCE part of this
          to check the opened handle for 0,  not ACE_INVALID_HANDLE, since it's
          a FILE *, not a handle. With this fix, the WinCE part and the VxWorks
          part are the same, so they were combined.

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp: Added access_test() to test ACE_OS::access()
          features.

Wed Jun 16 06:58:33 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * docs/ACE-bug-process.html:
        * docs/ACE-development-process.html:
          Corrected links for commercial support and always use the generic
          page with all commercial support companies

        * docs/ACE-porting.html:
          Updated that ACE_OS is now a namespace, not a class

Wed Jun 16 12:05:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/ACE-porting.html:
          Updated, we now require C++ namespace and ANSI casts.

Wed Jun 16 10:38:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.{h,inl}:
          Added ace_isalnum, ace_isalpha, ace_iscntrl, ace_isdigit,
          ace_isgraph, ace_islower, ace_ispunct, ace_isupper, ace_isxdigit,
          and to_upper. This fixes bugzilla [1762].

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-pre62x.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
          Added define ACE_LACKS_TOWUPPER, these files already set
          ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER so I assume that they are the ones
          that also lack towlower.

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:
          Use ACE_OS::isalnum instead of isalnum directly to fix compile
          errors in Tru64 build.

Wed Jun 16 10:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/Service_Config.perl:
          Zapped this file, it converts very old ACE code in a little bit
          newer code and we don't need to do this anymore

Wed Jun 16 09:59:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/rename-ace.pl:
          Zapped this file, we don't use it and there is no need to keep it

Wed Jun 16 09:57:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_pretty.pl:
          Zapped this file from the repo, we have now autobuild for this

Wed Jun 16 09:54:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/generate_compile_stats.sh:
          Let the default yrange be 5 seconds, 10 seconds is too much for ACE,
          the graphs are hard to read.

Wed Jun 16 08:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/*.{h,cpp,i,inl}:
        * ace/Makefile.ac:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Replaced all .i files with its .inl version. Cvs can't handle
          rename, so the .i file is removed and the same contents is
          added as .inl, so if you need history, it can be that you
          have to look at the .i file for the complete history. Updated
          the .h and .cpp files for the needed includes.

Tue Jun 15 23:31:51 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Changed ACE_HAS_UCONTEXT_T test to include <signal.h> and
          <ucontext.h> (if it exists).
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1844.

        * configure.ac:
          Set ACE_SIG_MACROS if any of sigemptyset, sigdelset, sigaddset,
          sigdelset, or sigismember are macros.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1836.

          Added missing includes

Tue Jun 15 22:11:09 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/IOStream/client/iostream_client.cpp:

          Added missing "ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h" and "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h"
          includes.

Tue Jun 15 20:27:06 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_select.h:
          Added #include of os_unistd.h to bring in select() declaration
          on 4.4BSD derived systems.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1842.

        * configure.ac:
        * ace/config_h.m4:
          Added check for gethostent which sets ACE_LACKS_GETHOSTENT if
          it does not exist.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1838.

        * configure.ac:
        * ace/config_h.m4:
          Changed check for <stropts.h> to set ACE_LACKS_STROPTS_H if it
          doesn't exist.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1837.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Avoid declaring sys_nerr on those targets which provide one in
          their system headers to avoid conflicts due to differing const
          qualification, etc.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1843.

Tue Jun 15 12:18:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp:
          Added missing include

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUObjectGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUDependencyWriter.pm:
          Generated dependencies that do not depend on the particular
          values of VDIR, VSHDIR, OBJEXT and SOEXT at the time of the
          dependency generation.  Using the values is silly, as they can
          easily be expanded when the dependencies are used.  This new
          style makes dependencies "portable."

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:
          Only consider lines that match '^\s*#', preprocessor directives
          follow that pattern.  The old code could have added #includes
          inside comments (except that most comments were stripped.)
          Reduce the depth of those nested ifs() a little bit.

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html: Updated the guidelines to
          recommend the use of ".inl" suffices for inline files, rather
          than ".i".  Thanks to Patrick Bennett <patrick.bennett@inin.com>
          for motivating this change.

          was explicitly called.

          Changed checks for ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS with __ACE_INLINE__ in
          the h/cpp files. In the .i files changed ASYS_INLINE with ACE_INLINE.
          We now just use one method of including inline files. As a side effect
          we now have to add some extra includes for non inlined builds because
          they don't get the includes of the .i files anymore for free.

          we will add it when needed.

          Removed the files I zapped from the repo

        * ace/README:
          Added new macro ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_STATIC_TEMPLATE_MEMBER_INSTANTIATION.
          With the GCC compiler on HPUX, AIX and VxWorks we need to explictly
          instantiate static template members to assure that we have the static
          only once. This new macro is a side effect of bug 1823. We check
          for GNU and one of the mentioned OS's in the cpp files but this
          is hard to maintain and once in a while we find that in a certain
          file we lack a check for a certain OS. This new macro will be used
          as replacement so that we can control whether to instantiate the
          static template members from the config files. The changes to the
          cpp files will follow soon.

Sat Jun 12 17:16:53 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp (dequeue_prio_i): Change the use of

          messages with the same priority to preserve FIFO order.  Thanks
          to Olivier Brunet <o.brunet@free.fr> for reporting this problem.

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.h (class ACE_Message_Queue): Updated the
          documentation to be accurate about preserving FIFO order within
          a priority level.

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp (enqueue_i): Fixed an incorrect comment
          - the tail is where the lowest priority message is and the head
          is where the higest priority message is!

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Moved the Recursive_Condition_Bug_Test to the end of the list, it
          crashes hard with Cygwin and prevents to other tests from running.
          This way we now get a better overview of our current Cygwin support.

Thu Jun 10 21:40:03 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          their corresponding `ACE_wrappers/examples' directories.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:

          Use prefix {in,dec}rement operators where applicable instead of

          Fixed "pointless comparison of unsigned integer with zero"
          MSVC++ 7.1 warning.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait):

          Fixed incorrect preprocessor conditional.  Addresses "pointless

          7.1.

Wed Jun  9 12:04:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

          it portable for Winsock1 and Winsock2 environments. Thanks to

          Thu Jun  3 18:49:59 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>
          Only platforms with ACE_LACKS_STRUCT_DIR dynamically allocate the
          d_name string. All others include it in the dirent struct itself.
          Please see Bugzilla 1833 - this problem should be remedied in
          ACE_OS::scandir_emulation itself, and this patch removed.

Tue Jun  8 17:01:32 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Removed the AREXTRA
          definition. It caused all the files to be listed twice on the
          ar command line; once from xargs and once from the command given
          to xargs. Thanks to Ofira Shaer <Oshaer@ndsisrael.com> for
          reporting this problem.

        * THANKS: Added Ofira Shaer.

Tue Jun  8 16:27:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Removed the individual AC_CONFIG_FILE entries for the
          automake-generated Makefiles. Replaced with an m4_include of a
          MPC-generated list of all Makefiles it generated during the most
          recent MPC run. The file created by MPC is configure.ac.Makefiles.
          If this works well, we can generate the Makefile.am files as needed
          and remove the hand-maintained ones from the repo.

Sun Jun  6 09:48:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast): If there are
          no broadcastable interfaces found, mk_broadcast() now returns -1
          and sets errno to ENXIO ("no such device or address").  Thanks to
          Dave Craig for suggesting this fix.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast): Only complain about
          broadcast not being enabled for an interface if host_name is non
          NULL.  Thanks to Dave Craig <dwcraig@qualcomm.com> for this fix,
          which resolves bugid 1831.

Sat Jun  5 09:06:09 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/RMCast/RMCast_IO_UDP.i: Added a fix so that the transmitter
          no longer hangs waiting for the acknowledgement unicast response
          messages.  The recipients were transmitting acknowledgements,
          but the transmitter was listening to the socket that was bound
          to a specific multicast address.  Thanks to Dave Craig
          <dwcraig@qualcomm.com> for this fix.

Thu Jun  3 23:21:13 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp (close):

          Fixed compile-time error where "d_name" member was accessed with
          the dot "." operator instead of the pointer "->" operator.

Thu Jun  3 18:49:59 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp (close): Need to call

          ACE_OS::free (this->namelist_[n_].d_name);

          in close() since ACE_OS::scandir() allocates a dirent structure
          array that includes a dynamically allocated ACE_TCHAR *.  Thanks
          to Benjamin Bronk <benjamin.j.bronk@lmco.com> for reporting this
          and providing the fix.  This fixes bugid 1833.

          Appended file mode to mutex constructor to solve the
          difficulties reported by Bae-Sik Chon <baesikchon@yahoo.com>.

Wed Jun  2 07:30:56 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Added the class name for the ACE_TSS_DESTRUCTOR cast.

Wed Jun  2 00:03:20 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp
        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:

          Converted all ACE cast macro calls to their ANSI C++ cast
          counterparts.

          Use prefix {in,dec}rement operators where applicable instead of
          postfix operators.  The former are more efficient.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i:

          Converted all ACE cast macro calls to their ANSI C++ cast
          counterparts.

Tue Jun  1 18:31:44 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp: Added /**/ to naked platform-specific #includes
          to keep eVC from complaining it can't find the files.

Tue Jun  1 16:37:30 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (send): Set the port number of the
          broadcast address before sending the iovec.  Thanks to Dave
          Wolfe <dwolfe@gforcetech.com> for this patch, which fixes
          bugid 1830.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp: Added a cast for (ACE_TSS_DESTRUCTOR)
          so the code will compile properly on Solaris when
          ACE_HAS_TSS_EMULATION is enabled.  Thanks to Kevin Christian
          <khchristian@att.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jun  1 16:56:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp: Changed use of
          SHUT_RDWR arg for ACE_OS::shutdown() to ACE_SHUTDOWN_BOTH, which is
          set up correctly across all platforms. Fixes compile error on
          Windows.

        * ace/SOCK.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.h: Moved the setup of ACE_SHUTDOWN_READ,
          ACE_SHUTDOWN_WRITE, and ACE_SHUTDOWN_BOTH from SOCK.h to
          OS_NS_sys_socket.h. There's no need to include SOCK.h to use
          the lower-level ACE_OS::shutdown() directly.

Sat May 29 16:12:28 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:

          Added X11 related libs needed to build XtReactor.

Fri May 28 18:35:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/FIFO_Test.cpp (server): The select() trick to wait for the
          writer to open the FIFO doesn't seem to work on AIX. It seems to
          select() the fifo handle as a normal file handle, always readable.
          So on AIX, sleep 1 second before proceeding.

Fri May 28 15:54:26 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp: In
          Close_Socket_Thread::svc(), do a ACE_OS::shutdown() before closing
          the socket. This is enough to pop another thread off a blocked
          read/write on platforms that block the close() until an in-progress
          operation completes, such as AIX and Linux. With this, remove the
          #if linux checks that disabled some types of test.
          It could be argued that the shutdown() should be done as part of
          ACE_OS::closesocket() (it already does this for HP-UX), but I
          hesitate to rock the boat here...

Thu May 27 19:02:18 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp (schedule_i): For Win64, reinterpret_cast from
          ptrdiff_t to long is incorrect; static_cast is more appropriate.

Thu May 27 20:00:29 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/README:

          Added ACE_LACKS_REALPATH and ACE_LACKS_SWAB.

Thu May 27 12:10:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Svc_Cfg_IPC_Server.mpc:
          Changed exe's "after" clause to reflect renamed library project name.
          Also see:
          Thu May 7 02:00:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

Thu May 27 18:22:22 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE and ACE_HAS_MEMCHR macros.

Thu May 27 17:55:38 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Updated LynxOS resource advises. These were unnesessary large.
          This fixes bugzilla bug 1154.

Wed May 26 23:51:53 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp:

          Converted all ACE cast macro calls to their ANSI C++ cast
          counterparts.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl:

          Use prefix {in,dec}rement operators where applicable instead of
          postfix operators.  The former are more efficient.

Wed May 26 23:44:04 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Reactor_Registration_Test.cpp (Event_Handler):
          (handle_input):

          Fixed "comparison between signed and unsigned integer"
          warnings.

Wed May 26 10:36:39 2004  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_svnt.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb:
          Added these two mpb files to ease the mpc file writing for
          CIAO DnC run time.

Wed May 26 10:40:36 2004  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/README: Added description of architecture that
          I prepared for Carlos some time ago but never actually
          committed it.

Tue May 25 22:08:42 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Also turn off LIBCHECK when passing -k, keep-going.

Tue May 25 21:32:17 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Turn off LIBCHECK when doing dry-runs.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Print out MAKEFLAGS during builds.

Mon May 24 12:16:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Corrected comments in the pthread_rwlock-related
          checks. They had cut/paste errors and said signinfo_t. Thanks to
          J.T. Conklin <jtc@acorntoolworks.com> for this fix.

Fri May 21 16:44:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.mpc: Removed the pch
          specs from this and replaced with a normal exe-producing set of
          specs and files. There were no pch directives in the files, and this
          drove MSVC nuts at compile time, complaining of a missing #endif
          where there clearly was none.

        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.{cpp h}: Moved #include
          "ace/Log_Msg.h" from .h to .cpp, as nothing in the .h file needs it.

Fri May 21 15:28:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am: Removed OS_Export.h and Sock_Connect.i as they're
          no longer valid files. Please also see:

Thu May 20 21:19:44 2004  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.i: Add a method to get the byte ordering flag so
          that serialization of UTF-16 data will be able to do the right
          thing WRT byte ordering. This is necessary since UTF-16 byte
          ordering (as required by CORBA) is independent of the CDR Stream
          byte order.

        * ace/Codeset_Registry.h:
        * ace/Codeset_Symbols.h: Codeset_Symbols is a collection of
          #defines for all the standard codeset id values.

Thu May 20 18:23:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast_Test.cpp: When sending a datagram, only send
          the formatted text string, noth the whole buffer. Some OSes (i.e.
          AIX) don't allow a broadcast of that large a buffer. Also, fixed
          the style, indentation, and narrow/wide text capability.

Thu May 20 10:21:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Reactor/Client.cpp: In handle_input(), use "%.*C",
          not "%*C" to limit output to string length. In handle_timeout (),
          referring to a buffer in ACE_Message_Block's ctor doesn't copy the
          data; it simply refers to it. This would produce garbage output.
          Thanks to Dale Hawkins <dhawkins@cdrgts.com> for these fixes.

        * examples/APG/Containers/Queues.cpp (runStackUnboundedQueue): The
          DataElement arrays inserted into the queue should be defined outside
          their 'for' loops to avoid repeated, unnecessary constructor and
          destruction. Thanks to Bill Hopkins <bill.hopkins@level3.com> for
          this suggestion.

        * THANKS: Added Dale Hawkins and Bill Hopkins.

Wed May 19 12:46:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK.i: Added missing #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.h"

Wed May 19 12:14:21 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Reactor_Registration_Test.cpp: Fixed string types to work
          for both narrow and wide chars; fixed size types to work for
          64-bit platforms.

Wed May 19 08:57:24 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl: Fixed the ACE_OS::thr_self() call so that
          it doesn't use the ACE_OSCALL_RETURN macro, which compares the
          return value of pthread_self() with -1 to see if the function
          encountered an error.  However, pthread_t may be an opaque value
          (a pointer, a struct, etc.) that may not be able to be compared
          with a literal without an error.  Furthermore, the pthreads and
          X/Open XPG standards do not define any error conditions for
          pthread_self(), so checking the return value with -1 is
          meaningless.  Thanks to J.T. Conklin <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>
          for reporting this problem and providing a fix.

Wed May 19 07:20:35 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Conditionally use the .NOTPARALLEL rule based on the existence and
          time stamp of generated files in addition to the time stamp on the
          generation tool (if applicable).  In situations where the
          generated files are up-to-date, using -j<n> will actually be
          beneficial instead of ignored.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Switch to using depgen.pl instead of g++dep.  It is accurate and
          tremendously faster than g++dep.  The dependency generation tool
          can be controlled by setting the DEPGEN make macro.

Tue May 18 16:55:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.cpp (ACE_SCANDIR_COMPARATOR):
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h (ACE_COMPARE_FUNC): For Windows with Microsoft
          Visual C++ compiler, explicitly specify __cdecl calling convention
          so it remains correct even if built with a different default
          calling convention. Thanks to Ivan Murphy <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com>
          for this fix.

Tue May 18 11:26:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc: Replaced the "exename" lines for ACE_Test,
          ACE_Init_Test, and FIFO_Test. Somehow they got lost...

Tue May 18 11:07:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/client/local_dgram_client_test.cpp:
          Removed arguments from ACE_OS::tempnam() call, forcing it to use
          the defaults and select the char* variant.

Tue May 18 14:28:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/LSOCK.cpp:
          Added missing include ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.h

Tue May 18 09:22:35 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Provide the getBasePath() method which returns the full path to
          the MPC location.  This will be used by MPC's Version module in
          the future.

Tue May 18 11:32:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Condition_Thread_Mutex.h:
          Documentation fix

Tue May 18 11:28:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SOCK.{h,cpp,i}:
        * ace/SOCK_Acceptor.{h,cpp,i}:

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.i:
        * ace/SOCK_IO.{h,cpp,ï):
          Instead of using ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS use __ACE_INLINE__ to
          check whether to enabling inlining or not. The last is the way
          we now use and the first is not really working. In fact, all files
          with ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS use always inlining even when
          __ACE_INLINE__ is not defined. With the latest GCC versions on
          Windows we get hundreds of warnings that we are missing declspec
          import and inline, when building DLL's we disable inlining but
          this doesn't work for all files. See bugzilla 1581 for some
          more info. More files will be updated later.

        * ace/Sock_Connect.i:
          Removed this file, was not containing any code

        * ace/QoS/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.cpp:
          Added needed include of changes above

Tue May 18 08:25:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:
          When building ACE also build the examples, some of them are used
          in the test run.

Tue May 18 08:14:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Barrier.{h,cpp}:
          Made method signature in implementation same as declaration and fixed
          doxygen documentation

Tue May 18 08:00:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp:
          Fix for unicode builds

Tue May 18 06:20:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:
          Fixed compile error

Mon May 17 21:19:27 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:

          Spelling correction.

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp (normalize, operator *=):

          Optimized some code.

          ACE coding style updates.

        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp (run_main):

          Updated code to conform to ACE coding conventions.

Mon May 17 17:35:24 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp (schedule): Don't narrow the scheduled timer ID
          from long to int; this smashes the ID on 64-bit systems where the
          timer ID is larger than 32 bits holds; for example, in ACE_Timer_Hash
          where it's a pointer.

Mon May 17 22:38:48 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp (operator *):
        * ace/Time_Value.h (operator *):
        * ace/Time_Value.inl (operator *):
          operator *(double) moved from *inl into *cpp. The multiplication
          algorithm change to extend the range of results to
          <ACE_INT_MIN, ACE_INT_MAX>. Doxygen docs for operator *
          extended.
        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp:
          Added several tests for the result of multiplication by
          double.

Mon May 17 16:48:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp: Add #include
          "AIO_CLD_export.h" to the non-AIO section so it will at least
          build and load on non-AIO systems.

Mon May 17 15:46:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Templates.cpp: Added missing ACE_Atomic_Op_Ex
          instantiation. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for this fix.

Mon May 17 13:29:11 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Web_Crawler/URL.h: Changed return type of send_request()
          to ssize_t, matching change to HTTP_URL.h from:
          Thu May 13 14:40:12 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Mon May 17 19:19:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast_Test.cpp (run_auto_test):

          Removed warning on declared, but not used function. Added
          OS_NS_unistd.h include to make sure ACE_OD::sleep is declared.

Mon May 17 13:22:18 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.h (tempnam): Had to remove the default 'dir' value
          on the wchar variant because it conflicts with the char version
          when defaults are taken into account.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (tempnam): For the wchar_t variant, have to
          copy the narrow-char name to a wide-char string and free() the
          original.
          (fopen (wchar_t *...)): ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR doesn't convert a
          string if ACE_USES_WCHAR setting already matches ACE_TCHAR. Thus, to
          force a convert of wchar_t to char, use ACE_Wide_To_Ascii directly.

Mon May 17 11:58:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (writev): If the passed-in chain of
          ACE_Message_Blocks contains a 0-length block, it would cause
          a iovec to be uninitialized and still passed to WSASend(). This is
          fixed. Thanks to Ken Kane <kkane@livevault.com> for reporting this.

Mon May 17 17:00:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl:
          Fixed a bug in operator *=( double ) which caused overflow for
          results greater than 2 seconds. Thanks to Mirek Pabich
          <miropabich@tenbit.pl> for this patch.

Mon May 17 08:45:18 2004  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * bin/g++dep:
          Document all the crazy sed commands that are used in this
          script.  Also, simplified the data flow by using a single sed
          invocation (and a single sed script) to apply all the
          transformations.  Reduce the number of temporary files, and
          ensure that the sed script file is removed if an error or
          interrupt occurs.

Mon May 17 12:40:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp (handle_events_i):
        * ace/Semaphore.cpp (constructor):
        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.cpp (constructor):
          Made method signature the same as in the header file, this fixes
          doxygen warnings.

        * ace/Thread_Semaphore.h:
          Doxygen documentation fixes.

Mon May 17 12:32:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Hash_Cache_Map_Manager_T.{cpp,i}:
          Replaced T_1 with ACE_T1 and T_2 with ACE_T2 to be able to
          generate better doxygen documentation

        * etc/ace.doxygen:
          Added ACE_T1 and ACE_T2 to the EXPAND_AS_DEFINED list. These macros
          are used in some template classes to make the code more readable but
          doxygen gets problems when we don't expand these macros.

Sun May 16 17:40:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Base_Test/Baseline_Test.cpp:
          Fixed internal compiler error in MinGW build.

Sun May 16 15:39:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_MMAP and removed ACE_HAS_SIG_MACROS

Sun May 16 13:11:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Move the Process_Strategy_Test to the end of this file. It fails
          with Cygwin and hangs and prevents the other tests of running. So
          when it is last we will see the results of more tests on Cygwin.

Sun May 16 12:59:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:
          Print an info message in the TerminateWaitKill so that we can see in
          the build log files that a process is tried to terminate.

Sun May 16 12:47:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile error because of incorrect include

Sun May 16 12:38:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_KILL. Cygwin 1.5.9 gives a stackdump
          when pthread_kill is used, so disable this feature until we
          get a cygwin with this bug fixed.

Sun May 16 12:14:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Disabled the crash_on_write tests on Win32 because it doesn't work
          and there are no plans to fix this soon. See bugzilla 959.

Sun May 16 11:31:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_SYSV_IPC and removed defines that where needed for
          older Cygwin versions. We are still working on getting things working
          and even with the newest version we still don't have 100% working
          tests, so we don't bother maintaining stuff for older versions that
          are really broken

Sat May 15 19:48:00 2004 Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp (get_bcast_addr):
          The loop over interfaces was buggy the same way as previously in
          mk_broadcast. Fixed. It seems sa_len is serious portability
          problem. Shall ACE_HAS_SA_LEN macro be defined and respected?

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast):
          FreeBSD also has sockaddr.sa_len, hence the loop over interfaces
          shall work correctly.

Sat May 15 19:48:00 2004 Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast):
        ACE_ERROR message modified to print the name of problematic interface.

Sat May 15 19:17:00 2004 Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast):
        Quick fix to previous bugfix. It seems that not every system (eg. Linux)
        provides sockaddr.sa_len. Previous fix (see below) restricted now to AIX,
        QNX and CHORUS, where sa_len is avalaible.

Sat May 15 17:25:17 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.h:
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp:
          Fixed bug in mk_broadcast related with incorrect length of struct ifreq.
          Thanks to Mirek Pabich <miropabich@tenbit.pl> for this patch.
        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast_Test.cpp:
          tests/tests.mpc:
          test/run_test.lst:
          New automatic test for checking against bugs similiar to those reported by
          Mirek Pabich. The usability of the test is restricted, as some errors in
          broadcast handling can be detected only in LAN transmission.
        * tests/tests.mpc:
          MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test project name truncated to
          MT_Ref_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.

Fri May 14 22:13:13 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event.mpb:

          Reordered subprojects to force TAO_Messaging library to be
          listed in static link commands after TAO_DynamicInterface
          library.  The latter depends on the former.  Addresses static
          build link-time errors.  Thanks to Chad for providing a patch.

Fri May 14 14:22:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Service_Repository.{h cpp} (insert): If there's no space left in
          in the service repository, set errno to ENOSPC before returning -1.
          (remove): Added an optional argument that can receive the
          service record pointer for the removed service. If the pointer is
          returned to the caller, it is not deleted. If the pointer is not
          returned to the caller (the default) it is deleted (this is the
          historic behavior). This is needed to properly support removing
          a service record quickly after inserting it during service
          initialization. See "Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com>
          ACE version 5.4 P4", below.

Thu May 13 14:40:12 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Functor.{h i}: The ACE_Hash, ACE_Equal_To, and ACE_Less_Than
          "char"-type specializations were being done as ACE_TCHAR, and if
          ACE_USES_WCHAR defined, also as ACE_ANTI_TCHAR. These are now changed
          to always do 'char' and, if ACE_HAS_WCHAR, also wchar_t. Thus,
          they're both compiled whenever possible and not only when
          ACE_USES_WCHAR is set up.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.{h, inl}: Added wchar_t variants of tempnam ()
          and rename ().

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.{h, inl}: Added a wchar_t variant of stat ().

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.{h, inl}: Added a wchar_t variant of unlink ().

        * examples/Web_Crawler/Command_Processor.cpp (execute): Make sure
          the URL path string is narrow. (insert): Use ACE_TEXT around
          string literals.

        * examples/Web_Crawler/HTTP_URL.{h cpp} (send_request): Change return
          type from int to ssize_t, matching the normal types used in ACE.
          Use size_t, not int, for string size.

        * examples/Web_Crawler/Mem_Map_Stream.cpp (recv): Cast the length
          to off_t to match what seek() expects.

        * examples/Web_Crawler/main.cpp:
        * examples/Web_Crawler/Web_Crawler.{h, cpp}:
        * examples/Web_Crawler/Options.{h, cpp}: Changed main() to ACE_TMAIN()
          and all the command line options processing to ACE_TCHAR.

        * examples/Web_Crawler/URL_Addr.cpp: Add ACE_TEXT to string literals.

        Changes merged in from Siemens Medical Systems:
        Tue May 11 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P15
        * tests/Proactor_Scatter_Gather_Test.cpp: Close down the proactor
          before finishing otherwise the object manager will hang.

        Mon Apr 26 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P13
        * ace/Registry_Name_Space.cpp: Removed 64-bit warnings.

        Fri Apr 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P12
        * ace/Based_Pointer_T.h: Made target_ and base_offset_ type
          ptrdiff_t instead of long to avoid problems with 64bit.

        Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P8
        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/NT_Service.cpp:
          Use ACE_LIB_TEXT instead of ACE_TEXT.

        Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P7
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.{h,inl}: Added a wchar version of mkdir().

        Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P6
        * ace/OS_NS_fcntl.cpp (open):
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.{h inl}:
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_mman.inl (mmap):
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (mutex_init, event_init, sema_init):
          Added a thread safe method
          ACE_OS::default_win32_security_attributes_r().

        Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P4
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp: Insert component into repository before
          calling init as in the init the component may access the service
          repository.

        Tue Mar 16 2004 <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com> ACE version 5.4 P3
        * ace/Functor.i,h: Added the classes ACE_Hash<const wchar_t *> and
          ACE_Hash<wchar_t *> which had gone missing between 5.0.7 and
          5.3.1/5.4.

        Wed Feb 25 2004  Ivan Murphy <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com>        ACE 5.4 P2
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.{h,cpp,inl}: Added wchar version of fopen().

        Wed Feb 25 2004  Ivan Murphy <Ivan.Murphy@siemens.com>        ACE 5.4 P1
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.{h,inl}: Added wchar_t version of putenv().

        * ace/config-win32-visualage.h:
        * m4/config_h.m4:

          ACE now requires C++ "explicit" and "mutable" keyword support.
          Document these macros as deprecated, and removed all related
          references.

        * ace/Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Bound_Ptr.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:

        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.h:
        * ace/SString.h:

          Replaced all uses of "ACE_EXPLICIT" and "ACE_MUTABLE" with
          "explicit" and "mutable", respectively.  These ACE macros are
          deprecated.

Thu May 13 21:59:25 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          Potential ambiguities can occur if some classes, for example,
          contain implicit conversion operators whose return values can
          themselves be implicitly converted to a bool even though bool
          was not the intended type.  If multiple CDR stream insertion
          operators (for example) exist, including one that accepts the
          ACE_OutputCDR::from_boolean type, the compiler may be unable to
          choose the appropriate insertion operator.  As of yet, this
          problem does not appear to occur if the ACE_CDR::Boolean type is
          an "unsigned char" instead of "bool".  If the C++ "explicit"
          keyword is unavailable to us, resort to making ACE_CDR::Boolean
          an unsigned char, which also happens to be a valid
          implementation.  Fixes TAO builds on platforms that do not
          support the C++ "explicit" keyword.

        * ace/Synch_Traits.h:

          Corrected doxygen documentation.

Thu May 13 21:07:45 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp:
          Fixed compile-time errors for !ACE_WIN32 && !ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS
          case.

Fri May 14 07:05:43 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

        Added ACE_LACKS_MUTEXATTR_PSHARED for LynxOS 3.0.x.

Fri May 14 06:56:20 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp:
        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

         Added ACE_OS::realpath() implementation.

Thu May 13 20:23:12 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/Performance_Test.h:

          Added missing "ace/svc_export.h" include.  Fixes compile-time
          errors in multithread-enabled builds.

Thu May 13 18:37:52 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp: Added missing
          #include "ace/Service_Object.h" for the non-AIO case.

Thu May 13 21:39:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd: Changed dependency file
        name to make file names shorter. Thanks to Chad Elliott
        <elliott_c@ociweb.com> for this patch.

Thu May 13 21:39:00 2004-05-13  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html: Added guideline about long file
        names.

Thu May 13 18:57:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_LD_SEARCH_PATH defined as PATH. Because Cygwin runs on
          Windows we must use PATH and not LD_LIBRARY_PATH which is the
          default in ACE.

Thu May 13 15:59:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF. Cygwin supports this.

Thu May 13 15:28:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_MUTEXATTR_PSHARED, Cygwin export this function but
          it doesn't work at this moment.

Thu May 13 07:24:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Cache_Map_Manager_T.{h,cpp,i}:

        * ace/README:
        * examples/Web_Crawler/URL_Visitor.cpp:
          Removed ACE_HAS_BROKEN_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES. This was for a bug in pre
          GCC 2.8 compilers which we don't support anymore.

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Cleanup

Wed May 12 21:26:37 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/leader_follower.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Queue_Based_Workers/workers.cpp:

          Use the "ACE_SYNCH" trait instead of "ACE_MT_SYNCH".  Fixes
          single-threaded build compile-time errors.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Base_Test/Baseline_Test.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Base_Test/Baseline_Test.h:

          #ifdef out the code if ACE_HAS_THREADS is not defined.  This
          code is only meant to be used when multithreading support in ACE
          is enabled.  Fixes single-threaded build compile-time errors.

        * ace/Profile_Timer.h (ACE_Profile_Timer::ACE_Elapsed_Time):

          Corrected Doxygen documentation for this class.

        * ace/Profile_Timer.cpp (elapsed_time):

          Corrected comments in this method.

        * ace/RW_Mutex.h:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

Wed May 12 16:48:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp: If built on
          a platform that doesn't offer AIO, display an error message on
          service load, and fail.

Wed May 12 11:34:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h: Reverted this change:
          Tue May 11 12:33:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          because I mistakenly wiped out AIOCB_Proactor support, not
          CB_Proactor support. Thanks to Matthew Corey for correcting
          me on this.

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.{h cpp}: Also related to:
          Tue May 11 12:33:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          Removed the __FreeBSD_version_ check and all FreeBSD-specific
          code from ACE_POSIX_CB_Proactor. This class is no longer compiled
          on FreeBSD per Matthew Corey's advice.

        * ace/Proactor.cpp (ctor): Added __FreeBSD__ to the condition under
          which ACE_POSIX_CB_Proactor is not used as the default
          implementation. Thanks to Bill Cassanova for reporting this.

Wed May 12 13:29:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl(sendv):
          When WSASend returns SOCKET_ERROR we already set errno, but
          we have to return -1 in that case. The number of bytes send
          in case of failure with WinSock2 is always 0, and this is
          used differently by the callers. This fixes bugzilla bug 1816.

Wed May 12 08:09:49 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:

          Sort the directories when forming the cppdir value.  We need to
          ensure that '.' comes first.  Borland make attempts to generate
          source files in each CPPDIR directory until it is successful
          which explains multiple invocations of tao_idl.

Wed May 12 07:32:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Cleanup

        * examples/Web_Crawler/URL_Visitor.h:
          Removed commented out code

Wed May 12 07:03:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/README:
          Removed description of ACE_HAS_GNUC_BROKEN_TEMPLATE_INLINE_FUNCTIONS.
          This was for a bug in GCC 2.7.3 which we don't support anymore and
          none of the config files set this define at this moment.

        * ace/Thread_Manager.h:
          Removed usage of ACE_INLINE_FOR_GNUC and improved doxygen
          documentation

        * ace/Memory_Pool.h:
          Improved doxygen documentation

        * ace/Mem_IO.h:
          Removed usage of ACE_INLINE_FOR_GNUC

        * ace/config-lite.h:
          Removed checking of ACE_HAS_GNUC_BROKEN_TEMPLATE_INLINE_FUNCTIONS and
          setting of ACE_INLINE_FOR_GNUC. This was for GCC 2.7.3 and we don't
          support this anymore and the broken template define is not set in any
          config file.

Wed May 12 06:37:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl:
          After the ::WSASend call we must check the return value and in case
          of an error we must call ACE_OS::set_errno_to_wsa_last_error to set
          errno. After the other ::WSA calls we must call also this method
          instead of ACE_OS::set_errno_to_last_error. This fixes bugzilla
          bug 1815.

Tue May 11 17:39:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.rc: Converted back to
          neutral text format.

Tue May 11 14:21:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Streams/streams.mpc: Added 'threads' to the requires
          spec.

Tue May 11 12:33:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h: If FreeBSD 5, change the Proactor default
          implementation to not be ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor. Apparantly,
          FreeBSD 5 removed the SIGEV_THREAD notification method.

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.{h cpp}: Added __FreeBSD_version > 500000 as
          a condition that prevents this class from being compiled.

          Thanks to Bill Cassanova for reporting this issue and to
          Matthew Corey for digging through the FreeBSD headers to find
          out what's going on.

        * THANKS: Added Bill Cassanova and Matthew Corey to the Hall of Fame.

Tue May 11 08:58:33 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Removed non-existent headers from the Header_Files section.

Tue May 11 09:30:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Registry.h:
          Converted partly to doxygen style

Tue May 11 09:22:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/winregistry.mpb:
          Added new feature winregistry, this is set by default. This is to
          determine if the environment has the windows registry.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          By default with GNU make winregistry is set to 0 when not set.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
          MinGW has windows registry, so set winregistry to 1

        * examples/Registry/Registry.mpc:
          Removed gnuace verbatim parts and replaced by added winregistry
          as base project. Because of this the registry tests are now build
          with MinGW.

Mon May 10 19:17:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added define ACE_LACKS_THREAD_PROCESS_SCOPING, Cygwin lacks
          this and with this define set the Bound_Ptr test works.

Mon May 10 14:42:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Active_Objects/AO.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Active_Objects/AO2.cpp:

          Fixed to compile without ACE_HAS_THREADS enabled.

Mon May 10 18:40:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added define of ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_THR_EXIT_SEMANTICS. Cygwin
          has this and first tests show that now some threading tests
          run without problems. Let wait for a new fresh daily build to
          tackle the next failing test.

Mon May 10 12:15:45 2004  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (read_wchar):

          Replaced use of read_octet_array with read_array to take
          account of the endianness of the stream when demarshalling
          a wchar. This closes bug 1807.

Mon May 10 10:24:23 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl:
          Fixed incorrect trace

Mon May 10 06:22:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          The files with extension icc shouldn't be in the repo
          also, so extended the noncvs files with this extension

Sun May  9 13:12:37 2004  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          Added dnc to the default features to avoid unintentional
          building of $CIAO_ROOT/DnC directory.

Sun May 9 16:07:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Script checks now if file names are not too long. Names
          exceeding 50 characters are classified as an error (QNX limit),
          MPC files longer than 30 characters lead to warnings as MPC can
          add some characters eg. .depend.GNUmakefile.

Sun May  9 13:20:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Files with extension dsp and dsw and the GNUmakefile* files
          shouldn't be in the repo, so added these to the noncvs file
          check

Sun May  9 12:59:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Updated name of project file we must build first when doing a static
          msvc build. This has to be done because of the changes of
          Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl> to get smaller filenames

Sat May  8 16:25:31 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Time_Value.h:
        * ace/Time_Value.inl:

          Added an operator=. Without this, the
          ACE_HAS_TIMED_MESSAGE_BLOCK has no chance of working.

Sat May  8 00:10:23 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Concurrency.h:

          Use the "ACE_SYNCH" trait instead of "ACE_MT_SYNCH".  Doing so
          allows the JAWS3 library to build in a single threaded
          environment.  Fixes single-threaded build compile-time errors.

        * ace/Synch_Traits.h:

          Corrected doxygen documentation.

Fri May  7 15:59:30 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp (svc):

          Fixed "variable set but never used" Compaq C++ warning.

        * ace/TMCast/Protocol.cpp:

          Fixed "declared but never referenced" Compaq C++ warning.

Fri May  7 14:45:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * GNUmakefile:

          Removed this GNUmakefile.  It must now be generated by MPC.  The
          kit creation code in this file will be moved to the
          bin/make_release script.

Fri May  7 17:26:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Changed the rtti default
          to 1 and changed the associated -qrtti option from dynamiccast to
          all since some parts of ACE use type IDs.

        * ASNMP/asnmp/sagent.h: Added implied keyword "private" to sagent's
          derivation. Quiets a warning from Visual Age C++.

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Dispatcher.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/Log_Msg.h" to pick up logging macros. Removed #include
          "ace/OS.h".

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_cancel.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_udp_proactor.cpp:

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Base_Test/mutex_test.cpp:
          Added #include for OS_NS_*.h methods and/or "ace/Log_Msg.h" to
          pick up logging macros.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/guard_test.cpp: Added
          #include "ace/Guard_T.h" to see ACE_GUARD macros and classes.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/memory_test.cpp: Added
          #include "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to see ACE_OS stuff.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/recursive_lock_test.cpp:
          Added #include "ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.h" to find that class.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/rwrd_test.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/rwwr_test.cpp: Added
          #include "ace/RW_Mutex.h" to find that class.

Fri May  7 14:25:07 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Don't bother checking if errno is less than sys_nerr on glibc
          platforms.  strerror() can handle values greater than sys_nerr
          gracefully.  Fixes "`sys_nerr' is deprecated; use `strerror' or
          `strerror_r' instead" link-time warnings.

          Replaced deprecated ACE cast macro usage with ANSI C++ cast
          counterparts.

Fri May  7 09:38:06 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Mutex.h:

          Fixed doxygen documentation.

          Removed "ace/Log_Msg.h" include.  It isn't needed in this
          header.

        * ace/Mutex.cpp:

          Include "ace/Log_Msg.h" to pull in ACE_ERROR macros.

Fri May  7 08:08:05 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Reverted my change from Thu May  6 12:16:16 2004.  It can cause
          problems when all the generated files are present, but are
          out-of-date.

Fri May  7 12:15:33 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config*.h:
          Removed setting of ACE_NTRACE to 1 when it is not set, this is
          already done in config-all.h, so there is no need to do it
          in each config file seperately.

Fri May  7 09:48:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/build_example.bor:
          Removed this file, with the MPC transition we don't use it anymore

Fri May  7 09:11:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_Export.h:
          Removed this file, with the rework in ACE_OS the ACE_OS_Export has
          been deprecated and not used. This file is only used in the ACE
          library itself and not by users, so it is safe to remove this.
          This fixes bugid 1700.

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/config-win32-ghs.h:
          Removed usage of ACE_OS_BUILD_DLL and ACE_OS_HAS_DLL

Thu May  6 22:15:14 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidldefaults.mpb:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          ".inl" is now the default TAO_IDL generated stub/skeleton inline
          file extension instead of ".i".  The latter is generally used
          for preprocessed C sources.  Updated these files accordingly.

Thu May 7 02:00:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/:
          * Service_Configurator_IPC_Client.mpc move to Svc_Cfg_IPC_Client.mpc
          * _test postix appended to resulting executables to ensure conformance with
            examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/README
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/README: modified to reflect saome name
          changes
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/svc.conf repaired as for some time
          shared library is called IPC_Tests_Server, but not just Server
        * examples/C++NPv2/C++NPv2.moc: project names with *Logging* changed to *Log*
        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Queue_Based_Workers/Server_Concurrency_Queue_Based_Workers.mpc:
          moved to Svr_Conc_Queue_Based_Workers.mpc
        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/Server_Concurrency_Leader_Follower.mpc:
          moved to Svr_Conc_Leader_Follower.mpc

Thu May  6 12:16:16 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ACEXML/common/common.mpc:

          Since Source_Files is now specified, we need to also specify the
          Header_Files that do not correspond to any cpp files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/notification.mpb:

          The TAO_CosNotification library needs the TAO_Svc_Utils library.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Only use the .NOTPARALLEL: rule if all of the generated files have
          not been generated.  This can speed up parallel builds on a
          rebuild and on projects that share generated source files.

Thu May  6 12:43:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/BPR_Drivers.cpp:

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-client.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-client-simple.cpp:
          Added missing #includes so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS methods.

        * examples/C++NPv2/AC_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp: Moved the declarations
          of AC_Input_Handler and AC_Output_Handler to a new file,
          AC_Client_Logging_Daemon.h, so Visual Age C++ can see them when
          instantiating templates.

        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daaemon.cpp: Moved the
          declarations of AIO_Input_handler, AIO_Output_Handler, and
          AIO_CLD_Connector to a new file, AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.h,
          so Visual Age C++ can see them when instantiating templates.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_cancel.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp: Moved the declaration
          of the Receiver class to a new file, test_cancel.h and
          test_proactor.h respectively, so Visual Age C++ can see it when
          instantiating templates.

Thu May  6 11:04:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/DLL/Today.{h cpp}:
        * examples/DLL/Newsweek.{h cpp}: Added a nothrow-variant operator
          new if ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW is defined. The ACE_NEW_* macros use
          nothrow when available.

Wed May  5 23:35:33 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp (~ACE_Get_Opt_Long_Option):

          MSVC++ 6 can't deal with delete[]ing a const ACE_TCHAR *.
          Reintroduced a const_cast<> that addresses this issue by
          reverting a portion of the change in the "Wed May  5 14:14:53
          2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" set of
          changes.

Wed May  5 23:27:36 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (fstat):

          Corrected static_cast<> typo in Win32 case.  Fixes Win32
          compile-time errors.

Wed May  5 22:30:44 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Concurrency.h:
        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/Thread_Bounded_Packet_Relay.cpp:
        * examples/Smart_Pointers/widget_test.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/leader_follower.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Queue_Based_Workers/workers.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Base_Test/mutex_test.cpp:

          Include appropriate headers to fix undefined type compile-time
          errors.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_timeout.cpp:

          Changed ACE_Atomic_Op<> lock template parameter from
          ACE_Thread_Mutex to ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.  Allows this file to build
          in single threaded builds.

Wed May  5 16:34:13 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR):

          Improved doxygen documentation of basic CDR/IDL types.

          (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          Versions of GNU G++ less than version 3.0 defined a pre-C99 bool
          type that was an enumeration.  In some cases the enumeration
          could be promoted to an int, causing a potential problem where a
          4 byte integer (for example) could be selected when attempting
          to send a boolean over a CDR stream.

Wed May  5 18:10:32 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server-poll.cpp: Change #include
          <stdio.h> to "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" since ACE_OS::fprintf() is used.

Wed May  5 14:14:53 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Map_Manager.h (ACE_Map_Manager):
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h:

          Declare lock members as "mutable" to avoid using a
          const_cast<> hack in const methods that modify the lock
          member through an ACE_GUARD.

        * ace/Future.cpp (get):
        * ace/Map_Manager.i (current_size, total_size):
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.i:

          Removed const_cast<> around lock member.  It is no longer
          needed since the lock member is now declared "mutable".

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Attempt to use ::gethostname() on Win32, before falling back to
          GetComputerName(), to implement ACE_OS::hostname().  The latter
          returns the NetBios name, which may not be the same as the DNS

Mon May  3 18:12:30 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/TMCast/MTQueue.hpp: Remove 'mutable' from the mutex_ member.
          Visual Age C++ says you can only 'mutable' a non-reference member.

        * ace/TMCast/TransactionController.hpp: Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h" so Visual Age C++ can find ACE_OS::memcpy().
          Added #include <typeinfo> to enable typeid operator.

        * Kokyu/tests/DSRT_MIF/MIF.cpp: Added #include "ace/ACE.h" so Visual
          Age C++ can see ACE::is_prime().

        * Kokyu/tests/EDF/test.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_time.h" so
          Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS::gettimeofday().

        * ASNMP/asnmp/octet.cpp (to_string_hex): Instead of using separate
          #if/#endif blocks for fmt, one for WIN32, and one for __unix, use
          #if WIN32, #else. __unix wasn't defined for Visual Age C++ 6.

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Blobby/Blob.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS/clients/Blobby/Blob_Handler.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h" so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_OS:: string
          methods.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/mfc.mpb:

          Removed this file.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_mfc.mpb:

          The majority of the mfc has been moved out into the MPC config
          directory.  The ace_mfc base project now inherits from mfc and
          adds ACE_HAS_MFC=1 to the macros.

        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.mpc:

          Inherit from ace_mfc instead of mfc.

        * bin/cle.pl:

          Enhanced the domain name detection on Windows.

          MPC.

Sun May  2 13:53:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Task.cpp (svc_run):
          Also MSVC8 needs to use the static cast instead of reinterpet
          case.

Sat May  1 22:23:35 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/GNUmakefile:

          Renamed "Makefile"s to "GNUmakefile"s to make it obvious to

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Updated Remedy supported platforms, updated Borland build info
          and added a non supported platforms section where we list the
          platforms that have been supported in the past, but are now
          not anymore.

Fri Apr 30 18:11:35 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * PACE:

          Removed PACE from the ACE CVS module.  It is no longer
          maintained.

        * configure.ac:

          Do not define ACE_HAS_ANSI_CASTS if the compiler supports ANSI
          C++ casts.  ACE now requires that support.  If the compiler does
          not support ANSI C++ casts, issue an error message accordingly.

        * m4/config_h.m4 (ACE_PREP_CONFIG_HEADER):

          Removed template for ACE_HAS_ANSI_CASTS macro.  It is no longer
          used.  [Bug 1758]

        * ace/README:

          Removed description for ACE_HAS_ANSI_CASTS macro.  It is no
          longer used since compilers that do not support ANSI C++ casts
          are no longer supported.  [Bug 1758]

        * ace/config-lite.h:

          Removed ACE cast macros that wrap C style casts, i.e those used
          when ACE_HAS_ANSI_CASTS is not defined.  ACE now requires
          compilers that support ANSI C++ casts (e.g. static_cast<>,
          etc).  [Bug 1758]

          Documented ACE cast macros as deprecated.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:

          Do not support the MSVC++ 5 configuration header.  MSVC++ 5 is
          no longer supported.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-5.h:

Fri Apr 30 14:20:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU: For AIX 5.x, changed the
          SOFLAGS link option -Wl,-bexpall to -Wl,-bexpfull. This allows the
          gcc 3.x type information to be exported to the library and useable
          by applications. Thanks very much to Randy Hammon
          <randy@trancekat.com> for this fix!
          Also, if rtti=0, add -DACE_LACKS_RTTI to CFLAGS in addition to adding
          -fno-rtti. Also changed the rtti default from 0 to 1.

        * THANKS: Added Randy Hammon to the Hall of Fame.

Thu Apr 29 14:17:46 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-doxygen.h (OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER):

          Define this macro to be greater than a certain value so that the
          ACE_SSL asynchronous IO class documentation can be generated by
          Doxygen.  [Bug 1748]

Thu Apr 29 13:48:30 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (sendv):

          when attempting to send data in a subsequent loop iteration.

          (accept, recv, send):
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (read):

          Do not set errno to EWOULDBLOCK when errno is set to EAGAIN and
          EGAIN equals EWOULDBLOCK.  This saves us two (equality check and
          assignment) TSS accesses for the _REENTRANT case on platforms
          where EGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK are the same (e.g. Linux).
          Performance improvements should be evident those platforms.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_uio.cpp (writev_emulation):

          Replaced the old implementation with a new faster one based on
          the one in ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp that incurs no
          allocations nor copies.  The new implementation can also handle
          partial writes.  Performance improvements should be visible on
          platforms that do not support writev() (i.e. define
          ACE_LACKS_WRITEV), such as MS Windows.

Thu Apr 29 14:35:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.cpp (shared_connect_start): Corrected
          sizeof() usage; error introduced at:
          Thu Apr 29 11:25:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Thu Apr 29 11:37:12 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp: Add #include "ace/Guard_T.h" so AIX Visual
          Age C++ can see ACE_Guard.

        * tests/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr_Test.cpp: Add #include "ace/Null_Mutex.h"
          so AIX Visual Age C++ can see ACE_Null_Mutex when instantiating
          templates.

Thu Apr 29 11:25:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        These are all to quiet the 64-bit compiler on Win64.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i (write_wstring): cast size_t return from
          ACE_OS::strlen() to ACE_CDR::ULong to correct types.

        * ace/OS_NS_stropts.inl (putmsg): ACE_OS::write() returns ssize_t;
          cast it back to int for return to caller.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_uio.{h, inl, .cpp}: writev() returns ssize_t. Thus,
          the writev_emulation() method also must return ssize_t. Also
          corrected the ACE_OSCALL_RETURN 'type' argument from int to ssize_t.

        * ace/Process.cpp (spawn): When forming the +H command line options,
          use %I64d, not %d, on Win64.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor.cpp (shared_open): Cast the 'namelen'
          argument to ACE_OS::bind() to int to match the signature.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.{h i} (recvv_n, sendv_n): The iovec
          count was changed from size_t to int to be consistent with the
          other analogous methods in ACE.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Association.cpp (get_local_addrs, get_remote_addrs):
          Correct usage of int/size_t types.

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.cpp (shared_connect_start): Use 'int',
          not 'size_t' as address length argument to ACE_OS::bind().

        * ace/UUID.cpp (to_string): Change UUID_STRING_LENGTH from int to
          size_t to match string handling length types.

Thu Apr 29 06:13:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/ThreadSafety/Tokens_Deadlock.cpp:

          Fixed unused parameter and variable warnings in the ACE_NLOGGING
          case.

        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.cpp:

          Include "ace/Signal.h" to pull in ACE_Sig_Action class
          declaration.

Wed Apr 28 14:25:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Removed $(EXEEXT) for BIN_UNCHECKED. This has strange problems
          in our MinGW build. We are looking at this again for OpenVMS.

Wed Apr 28 13:00:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Mutex.{cpp,inl}:
          - Improved the dump() method.
          - Release all resources in the remove()
          - Changed the constructor not to allocate unnecessary resource
            (thread mutex) in case process shared mutex is requested
            *and* supported
          Change from Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

Wed Apr 28 12:53:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp:
        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp:
          Added missing quotes to the ACE_RCSID macro.

Wed Apr 28 12:19:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        First checkin of the OpenVMS port of ACE. This port is done by
        Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>. This is not finished yet, we have
        to do more testing but a lot of the ACE tests work without problems.
        Documentation and readmes will be updated in the near future with
        an explanation how to use ACE on OpenVMS.

        * ace/Mem_Map.cpp (open):
          Added special VMS sharing attributes for memory map file ::open()

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp (commit_backing_store_name):
          ::fsync() called to make sure change is commited to disk.

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp (ldfind, ldname):
          Added OpenVMS way of finding shared libraries

        * ace/ACE.i (recv_i):
          OpenVMS cannot ::read() on socket, must use ::recv()

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (fstat):
          Called ::fsync() before calling ::fstat() to make sure all changes
          have been commited to disk

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_mman.inl:
          In ACE_OS::mmap() added ::fsync() before ::mmap() to make sure all
          is committed to disk.
          In ACE_OS::shm_open() added special OpenVMS sharing attributes for
          memory map file ::open()

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          New config file for OpenVMS 7.3-2.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          New file for OpenVMS 7.3-2

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Use $(EXEEXT) for BIN_UNCHECKED.

Wed Apr 28 09:34:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added special way of pwd retrieval for mingw because the normal
          way gives problems under mingw. Thanks to Martin Corino
          <mcorino@remedy.nl> for creating this patch.

Wed Apr 28 06:19:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp (DllMain):
          Replaced check for ACE_OS_HAS_DLL with ACE_HAS_DLL. ACE_OS_HAS_DLL
          is deprecated and will be removed in the near future. Thanks to
          Felix Wyss <FelixW@inin.com> for reporting this.

Wed Apr 28 06:13:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile problems in unicode builds

Tue Apr 27 18:15:40 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (rw_trywrlock_upgrade): If on a platform
          with ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT, try the call. It'll probably fail,
          but the error is more accurate than ENOTSUP.

        * tests/Reader_Writer_Test.cpp: Realign the diagnostics on write lock
          upgrade failure to match the #if/#else logic in
          ACE_OS::rw_trywrlock_upgrade(). Add some %p to the output to help
          more in failure conditions.

Tue Apr 27 08:31:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Threads/Message_Queue.cpp:
          Don't use ACE_Reactor deprecreated methods.

Tue Apr 27 08:18:23 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/MT_Reactor_Timer_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Notify_Performance_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp:
        * tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Test.cpp:
          Don't use ACE_Get_Opt and ACE_Reactor deprecreated methods.

Mon Apr 26 17:21:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Change the tests for sem_init() and sem_destroy() to
          use AC_SEARCH_LIBS instead of AC_CHECK_FUNC. The entrypoints are in
          librt, so weren't being located. This allows ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM to
          be detected correctly.

Mon Apr 26 17:31:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Acceptor.cpp:
          Use ACE_Reactor::instance()->end_reactor_event_loop () to end the
          event loop instead of the deprecated ACE::Reactor::end_event_loop()

Mon Apr 26 02:09:01 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          This type is now a true C++ "bool".  On a related note, the
          OMG IDL-to-C++ mapping allows this type to be "bool" for ANSI
          compliant compilers.  All compilers currently supported by ACE
          support the C++ "bool" type, so we're in luck.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:

          Made all single argument "{from,to}_*" constructors explicit (if
          supported by the compiler), as required by the OMG IDL-to-C++
          mapping.  Addresses potential implicit conversion issues.

          Fixed some broken Doxygen documentation.

          (good_bit_, do_byte_swap_, current_is_writable_):

          Converted these flags and their corresponding accessors from
          "int" to "bool", and changed the declaration order to optimize
          size of ACE_{Output,Input}CDR classes by avoiding unnecessary
          static alignment padding.  Both classes are now 8
          bytes smaller, at least on platforms with 4 byte alignment.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:

          Updated good_bit_, do_byte_swap_ and current_is_writable_
          assignments to use C++ "bool" values.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:

          Updated base member initializer lists to match new member
          declaration order.

          Updated good_bit_, do_byte_swap_ and current_is_writable_
          assignments to use C++ "bool" values.

          Use "const" where applicable.

          Use prefix increment operator instead of postfix increment
          operator where applicable.  The former is more efficient.

Mon Apr 26 15:05:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue.cpp:
          In ACE_Message_Queue_NT::open() use ACTIVATED instead of
          WAS_ACTIVE because the last is deprecated.

Mon Apr 26 10:04:43 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/mfc.mpb:

          Within 'specific' sections, set the subsystem and use_mfc template
          variables to correct values for use with MFC.

Mon Apr 26 09:59:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.h:
          Doxygen improvements

Mon Apr 26 07:44:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * os-patches/vxworks-5.1.txt:
          Removed this file from the repo. It is not correct anymore
          and we don't support VxWorks 5.1 anymore.

Mon Apr 26 07:18:23 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/test_config.h:
          Removed the non win32 version of ACE_APPEND_LOG. Bug 1792
          reported that child logs didn't work on non win32 platforms.
          A tests on our linux system demonstrated that when we removed
          the non win32 version of ACE_APPEND_LOG things works again
          on Linux. This non win32 version did close the file stream
          and this seems not logical. Thanks to Martin Corino
          <mcorino@remedy.nl> for reporting this.

Sun Apr 25 23:17:26 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-client-simple.cpp:

          Include "ace/Null_Mutex.h" to pull in ACE_Null_Mutex class
          declaration.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-server-poll.cpp:

          Include "ace/Log_Msg.h" and "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" to pull
          ACE_ERROR related macros and ACE_OS::perror() prototype,
          respectively.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/Makefile:

          Added missing ACE SSL preprocessor and linker flags.

Sun Apr 25 09:22:50 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidldefaults.mpb:

          Make use of new MPC features to correctly represent the output
          files generated with various tao_idl options.

Sun Apr 25 09:57:54 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Tokens_Test.cpp:
          Added include of ace/Barrier.h to fix compile error

Sun Apr 25 09:52:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Added TAO/tests/Collocation/run_test.pl

Fri Apr 23 22:35:23 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait):
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (dispatch_handles):

          Fixed "pointless comparison of unsigned integer with zero"
          MSVC++ 7.1 warning.

Fri Apr 23 22:26:19 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Web_Crawler/Iterators.cpp (next):

          Explicitly cast offset value from size_t to off_t to address
          "change of sign in integer conversion" warning exhibited by
          MSVC++ 7.1.

Fri Apr 23 22:13:35 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Token_Collection.h:
        * ace/Token_Invariants.h:

          Include "ace/Null_Mutex.h" to pull ACE_Null_Mutex class
          declaration.

Fri Apr 23 20:25:05 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.h:
        * Kokyu/Kokyu_defs.i:

          Changed return types for equality operators to "bool", as is the
          norm for modern C++.

Fri Apr 23 12:50:34 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Config_Test.cpp (iniCompare):

          Changed type of equality flag variable from an "int" to a
          "bool".  Addresses a "'&=' : unsafe mix of type 'int' and type
          'bool' in operation" warning exhibited by MSVC++ 6.

Fri Apr 23 11:23:04 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Local_Tokens.cpp:
        * ace/Local_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Timeprobe.h:

          Do not include "ace/Synch{_T}.h".  Include less expensive ones
          instead.  Fixes a "fuzz" error.

        * ace/Token_Manager.h:

          Moved "ace/Map_Manager.h" inclusion within the
          ACE_HAS_TOKENS_LIBRARY block.  There is no need to include it if
          that macro isn't defined.

Fri Apr 23 11:14:51 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Smart_Pointers/Widget_Impl.h:

          Include "ace/Synch_Traits.h" and "ace/Thread_Mutex.h".
          Necessitated by header inclusion reductions in
          "ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.*".

Fri Apr 23 15:01:23 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Thread_Manager_Test.cpp:
          When ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_KILL has been defined, don't fail on a
          non supported kill. Thanks to Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>
          for extending this.

Fri Apr 23 14:49:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Changed the way we integrate with Codeguard. Removed the -g
          commandline option and use "-Config Codeguard" to enable
          inspection of codeguard logs. This is much easier to maintain
          and this way the bin/auto_run_tests.pl doesn't need to be
          modified.

Fri Apr 23 10:30:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Recursive_Condition_Test.cpp: Missed a variable change.

Fri Apr 23 07:35:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (mutex_init): Forgot some changes of type to
          lock_scope for Windows.

Fri Apr 23 11:24:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Extended the checking of children logs. Some tests spawn child
          processes and these processes log then to a different log
          startin with the executable name, but then with a postfix. These
          child logs are already inspected, but only for error and warning
          not for the starting/ending lines. We now check whether starting
          and ending is in the log file and also the number of starting
          and ending lines must match.

        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Signal_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp:
          These tests did check for ACE_LACKS_FORK but didn't use fork
          at all, but ACE_Process::spawn() to spawn new processes.
          This function has much more implementations, so removed the
          check for fork. In case a platform doesn't support this test,
          this should be solved in the run_tests.lst file.

Fri Apr 23 06:15:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:

Thu Apr 22 17:06:04 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (mutex_init):

          Explicitly cast the unused returned values of an
          ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL macro call to "void" to address a "right-hand
          operand of comma has no effect" warning exhibited by GNU g++ 3.4
          (pre-release).

Thu Apr 22 17:06:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Recursive_Condition_Test.cpp: Fixed broken log string. Also,
          when checking nesting level, ignore it if get_nesting_level() returns
          -1, ENOTSUP. This will be the case for native Pthreads recursive
          mutexes.

Thu Apr 22 16:51:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Reverted this change:
          Wed Mar 31 14:43:48 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
          which confused the lock scope (process vs. thread) with lock type
          (recursive, non-recursive, etc.). Panagiotis sent a revised patch
          to separately specify the lock type as an optional argument,
          lock_type, to ACE_OS::mutex_init(). This allows Pthreads recursive
          mutexes where they are available.
          I also renamed the 'type' argument to lock_scope to differentiate
          this further and avoid confusion in the future.
          On ACE_OS::thread_mutex_init(), the meaning of the old 'type'
          argument is changed. It previously combined the scope and type.
          Now it is just the type (e.g. recursive), as the scope is inherent
          in the method used.
          For clarification on ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES, it means that the
          platform is capable of them, not that they always are, as one would
          expect. However, before Pthreads had recursion added, it was
          never optional. Now it is.

        * ace/config-linux.h: Only set ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES if
          ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT is set.

        * ace/config-aix4.x.h:
        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Added ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES. This is
          predicated on ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT, which is already set.
          Some other configs have ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_UNIX98_EXT also, but I
          don't have access to them for testing, so didn't add it to those.

        * ace/Thread_Mutex.cpp (ctor): Pass 0 for lock_type to
          ACE_OS::thread_mutex_init(), not USYNC_THREAD.

Thu Apr 22 11:53:00 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/fuzz.pl (check_for_non_bool_operators):

          Improved regular expressions to catch additional cases.

Thu Apr 22 12:00:00 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/TMCast/Link_Listener.hpp: removed ACE_Addr bug which led to
        sigsegv in TMCast applications.

Thu Apr 22 12:13:52 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ACEXML/common/codecs.mpb:
        * ACEXML/common/common.mpc:

          Support disabling the ace_codecs feature.  This project takes
          advantage of the ! (not) feature of MPC.

Thu Apr 22 14:00:05 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ace_tests.lst:
          The wfmo reactor tests shouldn't be run using Cywin. The wfmo
          run_test.pl test for windows but Cygwin runs on windows but
          doesn't have the wfmo reactor.

Thu Apr 22 07:58:20 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/prj_install.pl:
          Removed this file.  It now lives in the MPC directory.

Thu Apr 22 00:22:03 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/fuzz.pl (check_for_non_bool_operators):

          New test that determines if equality, relational and logical
          operators return a type other than "bool".  A "bool" return type
          for such operators is the norm for modern C++ compilers.

Thu Apr 22 07:12:22 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Added TAO/tests/Bug_1495_Regression.pl to the list of test
          that must be run.

Thu Apr 22 06:02:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/QoS/qos.mpc:
          With Visual C++ 8 also define ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2_GQOS. Visual C++
          8 is at this moment Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 March
          2004 Preview.

Wed Apr 21 13:36:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_time.h: Reverted this change:
          Thu Apr 15 17:56:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          and directly include <sys/time.h> instead. Although the Apr 15
          change fixed the g++ build on HP-UX, it revived a compile error
          for the aC++ build wherein the ACE_OS::sigaction() method would
          not compile, apparantly due to some confusion over partially-defined
          struct sigaction in some inlined situations. I have no idea why,
          but at this point, both the aC++ and g++ builds are quiet.

Tue Apr 20 12:47:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_shm.h:
          Removed empty shmaddr when ACE_WIN32 is set, it is not used in
          ACE. Added empty struct shmid_ds when ACE_LACKS_SHMID_DS_T is
          defined.

        * ace/README:
          Added ACE_LACKS_SHMID_DS_T

Tue Apr 20 06:17:43 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * THANKS:

          To avoid spam for our dear users we have changed the @ symbol

Mon Apr 19 14:10:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Moved the implementation of ACE_OS::thr_equal() before the first
          placed where it is used in this file. This fixes a warning in the
          Tru64 build.

Mon Apr 19 14:02:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_msg.h:
          Instead of defining an empty struct msqid_ds when
          ACE_WIN32 is set, use the new ACE_LACKS_MSQID_DS_T define.

        * ace/README:
          Added ACE_LACKS_MSQID_DS_T description

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Win32 doesn't have the struct msqid_ds, so added ACE_LACKS_MSQID_DS_T

Fri Apr 16 12:34:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icp:

          Removed these MSVC make files. These are all now generatable via MPC.

Fri Apr 16 09:35:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Default_Constants.h:
          Added ACE_MAX_UDP_PACKET_SIZE

        * ace/RMCast/RMCast_IO_UDP.cpp:
          Use ACE_MAX_UDP_PACKET_SIZE instead of a hardcoded constant. Makes
          it possible to overrule the value from the config.h file.

Fri Apr 16 06:38:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Fixed error in the libcheck that was put in accidently when merging
          from our test system to the latest cvs version.

Thu Apr 15 23:28:24 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU (CCFLAGS):
          (CPPFLAGS):

          Moved preprocessor flags in compiler flags variable $(CCFLAGS)
          to preprocessor flags variable $(CPPFLAGS).  Addresses potential
          dependency generation problems.

Thu Apr 15 17:56:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_time.h: Include ace/os_include/sys/os_time.h
          before <time.h>. This insures that the X/Open form of select(),
          using fdset* as opposed to int*, gets selected, at least on HP-UX.

Thu Apr 15 14:38:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Reverted the $(PWD) changed, it caused unexpected problems. We are
          working on a better solution.

Thu Apr 15 12:33:27 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Changed the way we do a lib check. Instead of using the shell we use
          normal make rules. Another advantage is that we now give all libraries
          we are missing instead of the first one. Thanks to
          Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for changing this.

Thu Apr 15 12:29:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/check_build_logs:
        * bin/show_log_dir.pl:
        * bin/vc_filter.pl:
          Removed these files, they are old and not needed anymore. Looks
          some more files in bin can be removed, we should have a good look
          at what we really need

Thu Apr 15 07:20:35 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added information on how to obtain MPC and the location of
          documentation.

Thu Apr 15 10:52:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
          Set PRELIB to empty for MinGW and set a specific PWD.

Thu Apr 15 10:16:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          Reimplemented the ACE_OS::setsid(). Introduced ACE_LACKS_SETSID so
          that from the config file we can say if the platform supports setsid()
          or not. VxWorks and PSOS don't have the concept of processes so
          there we return just 0, just like to other methods related to this one.
          This way when we get another port to a platform which doesn't have
          setsid() we just have to add this define to the config file.

        * ace/config-chorus.h:
        * ace/config-integritySCA:
        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Added define of ACE_LACKS_SETSID because these platforms lack this

        * ace/README:
          Documented ACE_LACKS_SETSID

Thu Apr 15 09:51:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Introduced PWD. This is used to get the current working
          directory. When it is not set, it is $(shell pwd). On Windows
          without cygwin we don't have pwd, so we need to get another
          way of doing this, this makes it possible to overrule this.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Use $(PWD) to get the working directory

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Added mingw specific rules for determining if the GNU ld has -E

Thu Apr 15 08:54:33 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl:
          Changed order of inline methods to fix warnings in Tru64 build.

Thu Apr 15 08:37:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          Changed location of ACE_OS::getpagesize(). The method must be
          above the first place where it is used. This fixes a warning
          in the Tru64 build.

Thu Apr 15 07:14:21 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/ThreadSafety/Tokens.cpp:
          Added include of ace/OS_NS_time.h to get ACE_OS::nanosleep

Thu Apr 15 07:04:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:
          Removed this file. The msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl script must
          be used.

Wed Apr 14 22:18:58 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/DSRT_Direct_Dispatcher_Impl_T.cpp (svc):

          Wrapped ACE_Guard instantiation within an ACE_GUARD_RETURN
          macro.  Addresses an unused variable warning.

Wed Apr 14 20:29:52 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (thr_create):

          Explicitly cast the unused returned values of two
          ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL macro calls to "void" to address a "right-hand
          operand of comma has no effect" warning exhibited by GNU g++ 3.4
          (pre-release).

Wed Apr 14 19:27:29 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h (_POSIX_TIMER_MAX):
          (ACE_DEFAULT_TIMERS):

          Moved definitions of these macros to other more appropriate
          files described below.

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h (_POSIX_TIMER_MAX):

          Moved conditional definition of this macro to this file to avoid
          potential definition before the one in <limits.h>.  Fixes macro
          redefinition warnings.

        * ace/Default_Constants.h (ACE_DEFAULT_TIMERS):

          Moved conditional definition of this macro to this file.  It
          didn't make much sense to define it in the os_unistd.h
          portability header.

Wed Apr 14 17:28:21 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_qnx_rtp_gcc.GNU:

          Corrected "fuzz" error regarding missing RCS ID.

Wed Apr 14 23:03:20 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:

          Additional validation in DLL_Handle::symbol.

        * ace/Mem_Map.cpp:

          QNX NTO cannot mmap regular files, but can map shared
          memory.  Mem_Map was modified for QNX NTO the same it was done
          for CHORUS, namely ::open and ::unlink was replaced by
          resp. ::shm_open and ::shm_unlink in QNX NTO section. This is
          only a partial bugfix, as one it prevents mapping ordinary
          files.

        * tests/Mem_Map_Test.cpp:

          ::open in QNX NTO  sections was replaced by Mem_Map::open to
          ensure ::shm_open is invoked.

Wed Apr 14 17:17:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Fixed missing end-of-comment mark that
          no-oped much of this file. Thanks to the compiler for all the
          help finding this one.... NOT!

Wed Apr 14 14:09:19 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h (ACE_DEFAULT_TIMERS, _SC_TIMER_MAX):

          #define ACE_DEFAULT_TIMERS to _POSIX_TIMER_MAX, not
          _SC_TIMER_MAX.  The latter is a parameter meant to be passed to
          the sysconf() C library function.  It does not represent the
          maximum number of concurrent timers per process.  The fact that
          its value is close to the value for _POSIX_TIMER_MAX is a
          coincidence  (e.g. _SC_TIMER_MAX on Linux/glibc is 35 and
          _POSIX_TIMER_MAX is 32).  This addresses potential problems
          where the default number of timers is more than the platform
          allows.

          In addition to addressing the above issue, this change also
          fixes a warning regarding an undefined "_SC_TIMER_MAX" macro on
          Linux/glibc.  On that platform "_SC_TIMER_MAX" is actually
          defined in an enumeration.

          (_SC_AIO_MAX):

          Removed this macro definition.  It served no useful purpose.

Wed Apr 14 16:18:10 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Cached_Connect_Strategy_T.cpp:

          In ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy_Ex::connect_svc_handler_i(), the
          reference counter of the entry in the hashtable
          (ACE_Refcounted_Hash_Recyclable) was being incremented in all
          cases.  It should only incremented if the hint passed to
          connect_svc_handler_i() is not used.

          Thanks to Torsten Kuepper <torsten.kuepper@nokia.com> for
          reporting this bug.  This closes bug 1781.

Wed Apr 14 16:14:59 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h: Add _M_AMD64 (Opteron) as a known little-endian
          architecture. Thanks to Ivan Murphy <ivan.murphy@siemens.com> for
          this fix.

Wed Apr 14 21:07:35 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: updated documentation in QNX section.

Wed Apr 14 12:34:56 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Makefile.libs:

          Reverted a change (Makefile.libs,v 4.3 2004/04/13 23:15:45
          mbrudka) that incorrectly replaced a dependency on test_config.h
          with test_$(ACE_PLATFORM_CONFIG).  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          for pointing me in the right direction.

Wed Apr 14 11:26:20 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU: If rtti=0, add
          -fno-rtti to CFLAGS. Previously, the rtti setting had no affect.

Wed Apr 14 10:04:43 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ifrservice.mpb:

          Added minimum_corba to the inheritance list.  The IFRService
          library won't build with minimum poa enabled.

Wed Apr 14 06:54:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Tokens_Test.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.h:
          Fixed compile errors when ACE_HAS_TOKENS_LIBRARY is defined

Tue Apr 13 12:51:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Local_Tokens.h:
          Added missing includes that are needed when ACE_HAS_TOKENS_LIBRARY
          is defined.

Tue Apr 13 08:44:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp (check_handles): Fixed typo.

Wed Apr  7 12:27:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/target.cpp (operator==): Removed the lhs==rhs check at
          the top. This is a nice-to-have optimization, but MSVC7.1 reports
          all control paths are recursive.

        * ASNMP/tests/Integer_Test.cpp: Changed 'si' from short to unsigned
          short. It's initialized with 32768, which doesn't fit in 16 bits,
          and the comments on its use inside the test itself say it's
          unsigned short. There are not other comments to explain what this
          is trying to do, so I may have this wrong... Anyone with more info
          on this, please feel free to contact me.

        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/MFC_Log.h: Formatting adjustment.

        * examples/TMCast/Member/member.cpp: static_cast ACE_UINT64 to
          unsigned long to avert a VC7.1 compiler warning about truncation.

Tue Apr 13 00:47:43 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h (ACE_NEW_MALLOC_RETURN, ACE_NEW_MALLOC):
          (ACE_NEW_MALLOC_NORETURN, ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN):
          (ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY):

          Explicitly cast the return value of the placement new operator
          call to "void" to address a "statement has no effect" warning
          exhibited by GNU g++ 3.4 (pre-release).

        * ace/Arg_Shifter.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_strings.h:
        * ace/Unbounded_Set.h:

          Nuked trailing whitespace.

        * ace/README:

          Updated autoconf support comments.

Mon Apr 12 17:43:51 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: In the newer-glibc section, add a
          #define ACE_POSIX_SIG_PROACTOR. This is a (possibly incomplete)
          attempt to make Linux use the sig proactor for newer linuxes such
          as Red Hat Linux 9 and Enterprise Linux 3, where it is possible to
          send a signal across threads in a process. I'm not terribly worried
          if the check is imperfect, since there's no chance for asynch I/O to
          work any other way, and not at all on Linux versions that can't do
          the cross-thread signals.

Mon Apr 12 16:40:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Force the Proactor implementation to
          ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor if the user didn't select one. The CB
          approach is not supported at HP-UX 11.00.

        Also this from the 5.4 support stream:
        Fri Mar 26 16:24:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Added ACE_HAS_SIGACTION_CONSTP2.

Mon Apr 12 13:55:46 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Caching/caching.mpc:
        * apps/JAWS/server/server.mpc:

          Made these projects require ace_filecache.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftclientorb.mpb:

          Made this base project require ace_uuid.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Cleaned up and simplified the template somewhat.

Mon Apr 12 12:54:37 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:

          Only define ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2_GQOS if ACE_HAS_QOS is defined.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qos.mpb:

          If the qos feature is enabled, add ACE_HAS_QOS to the macros.

Mon Apr 12 13:51:42 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Removed default part from the Template_Files, it is not needed.

Mon Apr 12 13:39:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
        * ace/config-win32-msvc-5.h:

          Moved define ACE_HAS_LLSEEK from msvc5/6 file to the win32 common
          file. This fixes bugid 1780. Thanks to Pierre Bisaillon
          <pierrebizz@hotmail.com> for reporting this.

Thu Apr  1 15:40:55 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp (activate_svc_handler): Make sure to
          store/restore errno when calling svc_handler->destroy ().
          Thanks to Ewald Dieterich <ewald.dieterich@fun.de> for reporting
          this.  This fixes bugid 1776.

Sun Apr 11 18:33:35 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * */*.icc:

          Axed them from the repo. Thanks to Johnny for reminding me to do

Fri Apr  9 16:07:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp (check_handles): The previous method of
          locating handles to check -- iterating the handler repository for
          ACE_Event_Handler pointers and calling get_handle() -- didn't work
          if the handler didn't do get_handle() as we expected. Changed this
          to build a union of the read/write/exception wait_set masks and
          iterate through that. If a bad handle is found, call
          remove_handler_i() based on the handle, not the event handler
          pointer.

Thu Apr  8 20:12:30 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * */*.bor:

          Removed all the borland makefiles files from the
          repository. Files in include/makeinclude have not been removed.

Thu Apr  8 11:57:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp (handle_output): Be sure to unregister this
          handler from the asynch task before posting the completion. The
          completion handler may do anything, including delete the handler,
          before this method has a chance to remove it from the asynch task.
          Matches an earlier fix for Windows:

Thu Apr  8 08:03:13 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidldefaults.mpb:

          Modified this base project to set tao_idl and tao_idlflags as
          template overrides.  The custom command was then set to $(TAO_IDL)
          and the idlflags was set to $(TAO_IDLFLAGS).  In all project
          creators (except GNUACE), these values will be replaced by the
          template override values.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:

          Override the expand_variables_from_template_values method to turn
          off variable expansion.  This allows us to set TAO_IDL and
          TAO_IDLFLAGS as variables within the generated project and gives
          more flexibility to the user.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcfullmacros.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcpartialmacros.mpt:

          Set the ACE_HAS_MFC macro to 1 instead of just defining it.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Updated these to properly support the 'pch_postrule' custom
          defined keyword.

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Updated these to give a somewhat more useful message when the MPC
          core is not found in the usual place.  Setting the MPC_ROOT
          environment variable can help these scripts determine the location
          of the MPC core.

        * bin/make_release:

          We now generate static project files for VC6, solution and
          vcproj files for VC7 (for the whole of
          ACE+TAO+CIAO). Additionally we also generate em3 files for the
          whole of ACE. This is for the ACE distribution only.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where relative directory replacement wouldn't take
          place if the value contained the current directory plus additional
          subdirectories.  Also, if the relative directory were the same as
          the current directory the replacement would be invalid and
          wouldn't point to the correct directory.

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Removed checks for certain things like OS.h inclusions and such
          since we may not have time to  fix them before the BFO. Once we
          clean the rest of the stuff for BFO, will add this back.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Modified grep test for linker output so it will run correctly on
          Solaris.  Thanks to Andrew G. Harvey <agh@cisco.com> for
          discovering the problem and providing work arounds.  Also, thanks
          to Kitty for <kitty@dre.vanderbilt.edu> for recommending which
          one to use.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/config-linux.h:
          Enable the usage of native recursive mutexes for the
          implementation of ACE recursive mutexes.  According to the
          README, ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES should be defined for
          platforms where all mutexes are recursive. This seems a
          little bit counter intuitive, as it implies that recursive
          mutexes are supported by the platform.  But in reality, it means
          that all mutexes are recursive.

          Added ACE_HAS_NONRECURSIVE_MUTEXES, which, together with
          ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES means the platform supports both
          recursive and non-recursive mutexes.  This maintains the default
          behavior on non-GNU/Linux platforms.  Thanks to Panagiotis Issaris
          <panagiotis.issaris@mech.kuleuven.ac.be> for this patch.

        * ace/README:
          Added documentation for ACE_HAS_NONRECURSIVE_MUTEXES.

        * THANKS:
          Added Panagiotis Issaris to the hall of fame.

          Instead of that people when they need to have a different TCPU
          need to edit these files, made it so that we only default to
          TCPU=pentiumpro when it is not set yet. In the platform_macros.GNU
          people can now overrule this default.

          Removed accessor for zero and max_time which where added in the commit
          above. We found that with some more complex TAO tests the linker was
          still having problems using the zero and max_time static members.

          As a different solution only for MinGW we define two static variables
          in the header file that use zero and max_time. With these two statics
          the linker can resolve these two members and we know don't get any
          linker problem anymore with MinGW. In case you had problems in your
          MinGW app, this patch also fixes the problems in your application
          without the need to change your app code.

          Thanks to Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for figuring
          out the problem and making the patches.

          when they are needed (ie. generated files are anything but source
          files).

        * ace/Functor_T.h:

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h:

        * ace/Task.h (activate):
        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.h (spawn and spawn_n):

          Changed the default flags in the above methods. They now include
          THR_INHERIT_SCHED. This makes the defaults consistent with C++
          NPV1 and C++ NPV2. If a priority other than
          ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIORITY is passed into the <priority>
          argument, the THR_INHERIT_SCHED flag is dropped silently. This
          takes care of the problems reported by Abhijit Sachdev, which
          was basically a bug that prevented the priorities being
          inherited in thread-per-connection strategy.

          Thanks to Steve Huston for motivating the right fix that would
          not affect user code at all.

          platform_macros.GNU file. All instructions regarding these now
          use the preferred method - creating a local file and including
          the platform-specific one into it. Also cleaned up some old info.

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM: Direct the user to not include an entire
          platform-specific config.h or platform_macros.GNU file. This is
          an effort to make submitted forms more concise and easy to read.

        * ace/config-sunos5.7.h: Leave Solaris using the AIOCB proactor at
          all versions. None of them work very well, so just leave this one
          in place, as it imposes no signal restrictions on the application.
          The concurrent access of (via aio_suspend(), aiowiat(), etc.) and
          use of for I/O, aiocbs is really wreaking havoc with the proactor
          implementations, I'm afraid. I believe this is really going to need
          some serious work.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rpc.mpb:

          Added the -C option to ensure that the generated code can be used
          by c++ compilers.  Also, changed the output source files and
          header files to fix a problem with make targets.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a generated target to allow users to invoke a rule to

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: Fix "unused argument" warning. The code

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          When gendir is set, a \ must be added, not a /. This fixes
          problems in the Borland builds that where caused by the fact
          that the realclean didn't work and we did compile old generated
          files.

Sat Mar 20 11:15:19 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp:
        * ace/Containers_T.i:
          Removed unnesessary LynxOS checks. LynxOS's updated compiler can
          handle these files correctly.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where a command dependency would be placed upon
          generated files.  The full path to the command is not always
          supplied  during custom definition and thus dependencies couldn't
          be satisfied because the command doesn't necessarily exist in the
          current directory.

          The solution was to add a new custom definition keyword that
          allows the user to determine whether the command dependency should
          be generated or not.  The default is to not generate a command
          dependency.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Documented the new 'dependant' keyword for custom definitions.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/psdl.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidldefaults.mpb:

          Set 'dependent' to 1 to ensure that the command dependency is
          generated for these custom definitions.

        * ace/Task.h:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.h:

          The following change has been reverted "Fri Mar  5 23:09:14 2004
          Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" . A better
          fix would be available soon. These fixes actually borke backward
          compatibility in a bad way.

Thu Mar 18 13:50:21 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_IO.{h cpp}: The change in
          Thu Mar 11 14:35:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          didn't go far enough... the problem exists in all derivatives of
          ACE_Asynch_Operation_Impl. Only ACE_Asynch_Operation deleted the
          implementation_ pointer in its constructor. However, since each
          derivative of ACE_Asynch_Operation was declaring its own
          implementation_ (in addition to the one in ACE_Asynch_Operation),
          no implementation was ever, in fact, being deleted. Hence:
            1. The ACE_Asynch_Operation::implementation_ member is removed,
               along with the void implementation(ACE_Asynch_Operation_Impl*)
               method that set it.
            2. The ACE_Asynch_Operation_Impl* implementation() method is now
               pure virtual in ACE_Asynch_Operation and must be implemented
               in each operation class.
            3. Each operation class needs to maintain its own appropriately
               typed implementation pointer, and delete it when necessary.
            4. The implementation(ACE_*_Impl*) methods are all removed, as
               none are necessary, and none are used any longer.
          The operation classes already were creating their own implementation
          objects, so that is the same now. However, they all now delete the
          implementation at destructor time.

Thu Mar 18 08:59:40 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Removed an extraneous dash in the install target.

Wed Mar 17 21:00:36 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h:
        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
        * ace/config-win32-visualage.h:

          Added a new #define ACE_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_DESTRUCTOR_TAKES_ARGS
          and enabled this feature only on the above platforms. With g++,
          it is supported with g++ 3.4. This #define is used by
          ACE_DES_FREE_TEMPLATE3 declarations in Global_Macros.h. Thanks
          to Oliver Kellog for providing the patches.

        * ace/Task.h (activate):
        * ace/Thread_Manager.h (spawn):
        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.h (activate):

          The last argument <inherit_priority> is now set to true as
          default. This will get the behavior that C++ NPV1 and NPV2
          prescribes. Thanks to Dr. Schmidt and Abhijit Sachdev for
          motivating this.

Wed Mar 17 17:55:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp (ctor): Change the default proactor implementation
          to favor CB, then SIG, then AIOCB. The CB proactor works best on
          many platforms, avoiding multithread issues with aio_suspend() on
          most platforms other than HP-UX, and avoiding signal/thread mixes
          on as many platforms as possible because it raises so many problems.

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.{h cpp}: Remove __sun as a condition that
          prevents compilation of ACE_POSIX_CB_Proactor. Sun can do this
          proactor type just fine. Added an 'extern "C"' variant of the
          aio completion function for platforms (such as Solaris 8) that
          have ACE_HAS_SIG_C_FUNC.

        * ace/config-sunos5.7.h: For Solaris 7 and later, use the default
          proactor, ACE_POSIX_CB_Proactor.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: Remove ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_PROACTOR setting.
          The AIOCB proactor doesn't work with multiple threads since the
          aio_suspend() call isn't multi-thread safe and ACE doesn't protect
          the aiocb list. The SIG proactor doesn't work before the 2.6 kernel
          because signals can't be queued across threads. CB works everywhere.
          Note though, that even at the 2.6 kernel, read/write to sockets (and
          some other things, I believe) get converted to blocking regardless of
          what the application does. Thus, the only way to use aio on Linux
          at this time is by ping-ponging, like the half-duplex mode in
          Proactor_Test. Not terribly useful...

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp: Only allow the CB-type proactor for
          !__Lynx__. Lynx is the only remaining AIO-enabled platform for
          which this proactor type is not valid.

Wed Mar 17 13:54:41 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp:

          Reverting this change since it breaks MSVC builds! Looks like
          VC6 is an old compiler wrt to ANSI C++ standards. Working things
          for g++ 3.4 needs to wait. "Tue Mar 16 10:48:48 2004
          Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>".

Wed Mar 17 14:20:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix5.1.h: The AIO enable/disable check added at
          Mon Mar 15 15:42:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          confuses the Visual Age C++ preprocessor. Rearrange it to use
          a temporary macro, _ACE_DISABLE_AIO_CALLS_ if we need to turn off
          ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS after including config-aix-4.x.h.

        * examples/APG/Proactor/HA_Proactive_Status.cpp: Add #include
          "ace/Message_Block.h" so Visual Age C++ can see ACE_Message_Block.

Wed Mar 17 18:34:14 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Changed -c to -g, -c is used by other scripts for the config

Wed Mar 17 18:20:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Added -c commandline option. With this option you can say that the
          script has to look for a codeguard log. This log is placed in the
          same directory as the executable, with the same name but with a cgl
          extension. We use this for a new codeguard enabled BCB6 build.

        * asnmp/tests/Gauge_test.cpp:
        * asnmp/tests/Counter_test.cpp:

          #ifdef'ed portions of the code which has no chances of compiling
          on Win32, since native support for the used basic types are
          missing. Changing the types to something else makes the test
          useless. Commenting it out for Win32 shouldn't hurt anyone.

          Use std::streamoff () to get the offset instead of casting.

        * ace/Malloc_T.i:
        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:

          #included OS_NS_string.h.

          Thanks to Oliver Kellog for providing the patches.

Tue Mar 16 09:40:36 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          When adjusting template values, based on the -value_template
          option, we must deal with them as arrays to maintain spaces within
          individual values.

Tue Mar 16 07:55:10 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where workspaces that contain projects that depend
          upon projects outside the local directory would have invalid
          dependencies.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Rewrote the 'if' handling code to be complete and support multiple
          or's, and's and not's.

Tue Mar 16 06:22:40 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Reverting my change from Mon Mar 15 08:31:05 2004.  It has
          undesirable effects in some situations.

Mon Mar 15 18:26:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Proactor/HA_Proactive_Status.h: Add #include
          "ace/Asynch_IO.h" so AIX Visual Age C++ can find things at
          template instantiate time.

Mon Mar 15 15:42:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix5.1.h: Set this up for use with AIX 5.2 as well.
          AIX 5.2 has POSIX AIO, but it's not run-time enabled by default.
          So, allow the user to turn it on, but leave it off by default.

        * ace/Asynch_Connector.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.h" and
          "ace/OS_Memory.h" to pick up needed definitions on AIX when Visual
          Age C++ is instantiating templates.

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.{h cpp}: Enabled use of the CB proactor on
          non-sgi, non-FreeBSD systems. AIX likes this proactor implementation.
          Also, fixed a mistaken timer setting where the number of desired
          milliseconds timeout was instead specified as number of seconds.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.{cpp, h}:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp: Moved the definitions of Sender
          and Receiver to a new file, Proactor_Test.h. This allows AIX Visual
          Age C++ to see the class definitions when instantiating templates.
          Removed the #ifdef __sgi around use of the CB proactor, as that
          is available and, indeed, works best, for AIX.

Mon Mar 15 13:42:13 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:

          Fixed a typo. Thanks to Andreas Koehler for pointing this out.

Mon Mar 15 17:21:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/C++NPv2/WFMO_Reactor_Logging_Server.cpp:
          Fixed unused argument warning in MinGW builds. Thanks to
          Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for fixing this.

        * examples/APG/Logging/Trace.h:
          In case ACE_NTRACE is set to 1 then TRACE_RETURN should
          return the given value instead of doing nothing. Thanks
          to Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for finding this.

          Added information at the top of the generated workspace for these
          types.  The information includes the CVS $Id keyword, the command
          line options for MPC and a warning about directly editing the
          file.

Mon Mar 15 08:31:05 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Warn the user if the version of perl they are using is less than
          perl 5.6.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug with custom file types where header and inline files
          would not be considered as generated targets if matching generated
          source files were not explicitly listed.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Add the $(PATH) to VPATH when using custom commands in case the
          custom command does not have a path in the exe name, which will
          allow GNU Make to find the command and process the rule.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/APC.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Timeouts.cpp:
          Cancel scheduled timers before quitting. This fixes the access
          violations we see in the MinGW build when running these examples.
          Caused by the fact that the event handler is on the stack and so
          already destroyed when the singleton reactor is getting destroyed.
          Thanks to Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> with helping solving
          these crashes.

Sun Mar 14 14:21:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.{h,cpp}:
          MingW has a problem importing static class data members (even with
          --enable-auto-import) in case these members are referenced inside
          heavily nested template class methods. It is somehow related to
          optimization since with higher optim. levels more linking errors
          are detected as with lower optim. levels. Since this is something
          which is not going to be solved soon in the MingW environment and
          the number of affected members are relatively few and the possible
          fixes relatively simple (create accessor methods) we added accessor
          methods for the zero and max_time static members of ACE_Time_Value.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.{cpp ,i}:
        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.{h,cpp}:
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.{h,i,cpp}:
        * ace/Timer_Wheel_T.cpp:
        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:
        * ace/Timer_List_T.cpp:
          Use the accessor methods to get zero and max_time instead of the
          static public members.

          This fixes the link errors in the MinGW build. Thanks to
          Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for figuring out the problem and
          making the patches.

Sun Mar 14 10:01:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp (ld_find):
          When the dll is not found on win32, try again using ACE_DLL_PREFIX
          prefixed. With MinGW all dll's have lib prefixed and when the prefix
          wasn't attached by the user things failed. This fixes the DLL test
          problems in the MinGW build. Thanks to Martin Corino
          <mcorino@remedy.nl> for figuring this out and making the patch.

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Removed setting of ACE_DLL_PREFIX, this is already done in
          Default_Constants.h

Sat Mar 13 18:25:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:
          The first step of this test is to test the selector. To test this the
          test uses Makefile as file to test for, but with the MPC builds we
          remove the file Makefile and generate the file GNUMakefile, so at the
          moment this tests runs there is no Makefile file and the test fails.
          Changed the test so that it uses Dirent_Test.cpp as filename, this
          is always there. Thanks to Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for
          figuring out the problem.

Thu Mar 11 17:00:14 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (handle_output): Be sure to unregister this
          handler from the asynch task before posting the completion. The
          completion handler may do anything, including delete the handler,
          before this method has a chance to remove it from the asynch task.

Thu Mar 11 14:35:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_IO.cpp (~ACE_Asynch_Connect): Delete the implementation_
          giving it a chance to unregister from the reactor and clean up
          anything else needed, as well a plug a memory leak.

Thu Mar 11 13:59:00 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Changed the custom rules to be more compact.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Made custom output files dependent upon the command that generates
          them.  Additionally, fixed a bug where generated source files
          would always be regenerated if idl files existed in the project.

Thu Mar 11 12:18:59 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a .PHONY target for each of the individual targets to avoid
          a possible problem if a file or directory exists with the same
          name as the target.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Remove duplicated mpc files when aggregating workspaces.  If an
          mpc file is added before a workspace is aggregated, the
          duplication can be detected.  If it happens the other way around,
          it can not and will be an error.

        * tests/tests.mpc:

           The UUIDTest requires ace_uuid.

          newly create SString object. Thanks to Michael Kircher
          <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de> for reporting this.

        * tests/SString_Test.cpp (run_main):

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Maintain directory groups when sorting dependencies.

Thu Mar 11 08:47:55 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.cpp (post_completion):
          ACE_WIN32_Proactor::post_completion executes these two
          operations in wrong order:

          1. If Proactor event is valid, signal it
          2. Post a completion

          If, for example, a Reactor is connected to the proactor through
          the event, it may receive the event notification BEFORE the
          completion has been posted, which is wrong.  To fix the problem,
          those two operations must be swapped: FIRST post a completion,
          THEN signal the event.  Thanks to Enrico Detoma
          <enrico.detoma@email.it> and Ishay Green <Ishay@onigma.com>
          for reporting this.  This closes bugid 1763.

Wed Mar 10 12:33:04 2004  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

Wed Mar 10 11:39:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

          the specified length to be sure we don't overrun the structure the
          address is copied to. There's a bit of evidence from a customer
          suggesting that (Windows) GetAcceptExSockaddrs() may return an
          address length of the length passed to AcceptEx, and not the
          length of a sockaddr_in structure. This guards against that.

Tue Mar  9 09:07:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Mar  8 18:03:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.i (activate): Remove erroneous

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the default behavior for all "make" based workspace
          creators such that the -hierarchy option is the default.  It is no
          longer necessary to pass the -hierarchy option when generating
          workspaces and projects of type make, bmake, borland, gnuace or
           nmake.

Mon Mar  8 11:38:43 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

          for reporting it.

Mon Mar  8 15:52:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.{h cpp}: Added ACE_POSIX_Asynch_Read_Dgram and
          ACE_POSIX_Asynch_Write_Dgram functionality. These were previously
          left as "not supported". The functions don't offer the
          immediate-success feature available on Windows, and the Dgram
          socket must be "connected" as there's no address-specification
          feature available in the asynch IO facility on POSIX.

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: Comment out the signal setup; this should
          not be necessary and, indeed, is erroneous, at least on Linux.
          It's commented out instead of removed in case further testing on
          other platforms determines that it is needed sometimes.

Mon Mar  8 13:48:06 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          this.

Mon Mar  8 13:18:13 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

Mon Mar  8 20:21:15 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h
          Added correct handling of ACE_NEEDS_IPC_1C_H for different
          LynxOS versions.

          ACE_HAS_TERM_IOCTLS is now enabled for all LynxOS versions.

          Moved missing prototype declaration of pthread_sigmask to
          os_signal.h.

          Removed unneeded ALIGNBYTES and ALIGN macros.

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h
          Added missing prototype declaration of pthread_sigmask.

Mon Mar  8 18:34:09 2004  Kobi Cohen-Arazi  <kobi-co@barak-online.net>

        * ace/Process_Semaphore.cpp:
        * ace/Process_Mutex.inl:

        That fixes bug 1153 thanks to Frank Kuhlmann <kuhlmann@materna.de>

Mon Mar  8 16:14:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp:
          Rewrote the retrieval of the thread priority so that we don't
          have to do a static_cast. The BCB compiler doesn't allow this
          cast.

Mon Mar  8 13:57:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/TkReactor_Test.cpp:

Sun Mar  7 18:35:15 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h
          Removed unneeded ACE_LACKS_MKTEMP macro.

        * ace/os_include/os_stdlib.h
          Added missing mktemp() prototype for LynxOS 3.x.x

Sun Mar  7 17:29:33 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation error on Win32.

Fri Mar  5 23:09:14 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (closesocket):

          Win32 distinguishes between shutting down a socket connection
          and closing a socket.  Therefore call shutdown on the socket
          before closing down the socket. Thanks to Kitty for digging up
          the MSDN documentation and the patch.

        * ace/Task.cpp (activate):
        * ace/Task.h (activate):

          Added an extra argument, inherit_priority which tells the thread
          manager to inherit the priority of the calling thread or use the
          priority passed in.

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.h (spawn, spawn_n, spawn_i):

          Added an extra argument, inherit_priority which tells the thread
          manager to inherit the priority of the calling thread or use the
          value of the priority passed in. This argument is set to false
          by default, which would retain the classical behaviour.

          Thanks to Abhijit Sachdev <abhi@qualcomm.com> for reporting the
          bug. Thanks to Dr. Schmidt and Kitty for motivating me to add
          the fix in ACE.

          I am not still certain whether the above fix is okay. Folks who
          call ACE_Thread::spawn* and ACE_OS::thr_create () will not get
          this feature. Still wondering whether we should propogate this
          feature down to ACE_Thread or ACE_OS level. Willing to hear any
          advise or motivation on this.

        * ace/Thread.cpp:

          Cosmetic formatting fixes.

        * ace/os_include/os_langinfo.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_spawn.h:

          Fixed typos in the included file names. Thanks to Robert
          Schiele<robert.schiele@t-online.de> for reporting the problem.

Fri Mar  5 18:12:24 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.cpp (open): If any of the steps in the open fail,
          close the socket and reset listen_handle_ to ACE_INVALID_HANDLE
          before returning. Also added ACE_LIB_TEXT around the naked literal
          strings for ACE_ERROR.

Fri Mar  5 22:56:45 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Converted it back to unix file by running dos2unix.  Added -*-
          Makefile -*- to top of file.

Fri Mar  5 16:56:25 2004  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Replaced the string 'RTP/UDP' with 'RTP_UDP' where specified as
          a command line argument to the AVStreams tests run_test.pl. This
          was to ensure that the '/' in the string does not confuse the
          script parser. This should fix the run time errors in the
          builds.

Fri Mar  5 12:14:56 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/mfc.mpb:

          Set the ACE_HAS_MFC to 1 instead of just defining it.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/notifytest.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtnotify.mpb:

          Switched these projects to use notification instead of notify.
          The notify base project only inherited from notification and
          provided nothing else.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/notify.mpb:

          Removed this file.

Fri Mar  5 10:56:35 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          More code optimizations.  A significant time reduction has
          occurred with the use of -hierarchy.

Fri Mar  5 09:47:55 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html
          Updated LynxOS section and fixed some HTML errors.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU
          Compile flag -Wall is now used on all versions of LynxOS.

Fri Mar  5 01:41:54 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Node.h:
          Added forward declaration for ACE_Unbounded_Queue_Const_Iterator.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Moved the IDL_SRC dependencies from rules.local.GNU to the bin
          and lib files to get around a problem with hand crafted makefile
          rules including all dependencies in the link line.

Thu Mar  4 17:45:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: For AIX 5.2, add a compile
          flag, -U__C99_RESTRICT, to work around a compiler problem that is
          tickled by aio.h. This can be removed when IBM supplies a compiler
          fix for Visual Age C++, which they intend to do in May 2004.

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp: Add #include "ace/ACE.h" to see
          ACE::set_flags(), and "ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.h" to see
          ACE_OS::filesize() on AIX.

Thu Mar  4 07:39:52 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Node.h: Added ACE_Unbounded_Queue_Const_Iterator as a
          friend to ACE_Node.  Thanks to Matthew Harris
          <mharris@hynomics.com> for reporting this.  This closes BUGID
          1759.

Thu Mar  4 16:14:04 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an infinite loop introduced by the previous change.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added progress indication when writing out workspaces.

Thu Mar  4 13:19:06 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:
        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Added an option to exclude dependency information from user
          specified files.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Added the option to exclude dependencies found from config.h to
          avoid pulling in files such as config-linux.h, config-sunos5.6.h,
          etc.

        * bin/g++dep:

          Added an option to be compatible with depgen.pl.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateInputReader.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          More code optimizations for an additional 8% performance increase.

Thu Mar  4 07:59:15 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:

          Enable alloca for LynxOS and remove the -ansi option from CCFLAGS
          (which allows users to use alloca).  Thanks to Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for providing this patch.

Thu Mar  4 06:39:11 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test_IPV6.cpp
          Fixed compile error on LynxOS.

Thu Mar  4 04:28:53 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added a dependency rule that all objects depend on IDL_SRC, if
          it is defined.  This makes more sense that having the resulting
          lib or exe dependent since it's the objects that use them, or
          more precisely, the cpp's include the headers, etc...  Thanks to
          Bala for motivating this.

Thu Mar  4 01:30:45 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Rolled back change: Tue Mar  2 23:57:29 UTC 2004  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>. Apparently, some compilers need
          things like -I, etc..., when dealing with templates at link
          time.  After the BFO release, we may try to determine who needs
          what, but since it isn't critical path, I've rolled it back.
          Thanks to Steve Huston from pointing this out.

Wed Mar  3 13:06:59 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Put in some more optimizations that make MPC about 9% faster.
          Also, fixed a problem with generating implicit project
          dependencies too many times when the -hierarchy option is used.

Wed Mar  3 16:58:16 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.nested.GNU:
          Don't use the "-C" option when invoking make recursively, use
          the "cd subdir && make ..." variant instead.  This fixes a
          compatibility problem Clearmake.  Thanks to "Pai, Ganesh"
          <GPai@sonusnet.com> for this suggestion.

Wed Mar  3 13:43:17 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Use a variable $TARGET_SEP instead of '-' to seperate the
          project name from the target.  Thanks to Chad Elliott
          <elliott_c@ociweb.com> for reporting the problem.

Wed Mar  3 07:42:54 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Rewrote my optimization from Tue Mar  2 12:28:09 2004 such that
          escaped double quotes are preserved.

Wed Mar  3 07:08:11 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          When dealing with template's, we need to take into account the
          possibility of windows absoulte paths (eg. c:\foo\gnu.mpd).

Tue Mar  2 20:03:43 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h (rmdir):
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (rmdir):

          Added ACE_OS::rmdir() implementation submitted by Andrew
          T. Finnell <andrew@activesol.net>.  [Bug 1409]

Wed Mar  3 03:23:35 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
          Add a reverseclean target that only has a realclean dependency,
          so that callers expecting a reverseclean target will get still
          work.  Since reverseclean is not implemented in normal
          makefiles, just in top level ones, this target must be handled
          explicitly.  A lot of autobuilds still call reverseclean.

Tue Mar  2 18:59:53 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Reverted my change from Tue Mar  2 12:28:09 2004 which broke in
          certain usages.

Tue Mar  2 18:36:08 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/TMCast/TMCast.mpc:

          Fixed the requires by removing the comma.

Tue Mar  2 23:57:29 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
          Added a check for "ciao" that mimics the behavior of
          already in place for tao.  This will enable us to know
          if it's a ciao project so we can include a ciao specific
          rules file.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:
          Output the name of the file that can't be opened
          instead of just saying unable to read.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
          Don't always tack on a file extension.  This was particularly
          vexing when trying to pass a different template file.
          This way, you can let your shell complete the file name
          that you find without having to hit the delete key 5 times.

          Allow calls to pass the absolute path--just easier for
          scripts to handle.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Removed $(CCFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) from the link step.  Thanks
          to Boris Kolpackov <boris@dre.vanderbilt.edu> for pointing
          this out.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Make sure assignments to CLEANUP_OBJS is always additive.

          Don't always include -pipe in CFLAGS, let users
          control it with the pipes option.

        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_Fragment_Test.cpp:
        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_Reassembly_Test.cpp: Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to get missing ACE_OS methods on AIX.

        * tests/RMCast/RMCast_Retransmission_Test.cpp: Added #include

Tue Mar  2 23:40:42 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:
          Don't remove files with the .exp extension from the list
          of files used to create a workspace since they are used
          by the gperf tests and will break autobuilds that use
          this script.

Tue Mar  2 23:26:28 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/g++dep:
          Added the -MG option so that missing dependency files won't
          cause g++ to stop processing.  Thanks for Steve Huston for
          pointing this out.

          Modified the sed script that modifies the output to correctly
          blow away only the platform specific config file.  This was
          needed since we now have config-all.h and config-lite.h.  Thanks
          to Bala for pointing out the problem.

        * ace/Makefile.ace:
        * ace/RMCast/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

Tue Mar  2 23:12:17 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:
          Fixed the CVS Id tag.

Tue Mar  2 22:58:40 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Rewrote the output generation to be more human readable
          by using standard makefile techniques.  Also, discovered
          a bug in the dependencies (that was also present prior
          to this change) since it's now easier to grok the
          generated makefile.  I'll fix it once I've checked in
          all the other MPC changes in my queue.

          Allow the user to generate projects with executable names with a
          modifier for different configurations similar to the library
          modifier for debug/release.  To enable this add '-value_template
          use_modifier=1' to your MPC command line.

Tue Mar  2 12:33:51 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4: Added HPUX_VERS to HP-UX compiler options, and
          -D_HPUX_SOURCE to aC++ options. This mirrors what the traditional
          platform options do.

Tue Mar  2 11:16:03 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Avoid looping and using substr to count instances of '/', use tr
          instead.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:

          Performed various optimizations to gain roughly a 10% increase in
          performance.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Rewrote the workspace generation code to be similar to the other
          make based creators and reduced the size of the generated
          workspace.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Incremented the version number.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed two bugs in the workspace creator:

          1) Using implicit as a scoped assignment caused project files to
             be added multiple times which is an error.
          2) When a project name with characters that could be special
             characters in regular expressions are not used within a
             workspace, but are referenced by other projects, the code
             would bomb out.

Mon Mar  1 18:03:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Multicast_Test_IPV6.cpp: Added #include "ace/Min_Max.h" to
          see ACE_MIN, ACE_MAX.

Mon Mar  1 22:50:51 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/SOCK_SEQPACK_srv.cpp:

          multiple interfaces properly.

Mon Mar 01 14:54:14 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * tests\MT_Reference_Counted_Notify_Test.cpp (Simple_Event_Handler):
        * tests\Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test.cpp (Simple_Event_Handler):

          Removed asserts in add_reference() and remove_reference() for
          event handlers not participating in reference counting.

Sun Feb 29 14:45:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          When building a static build, add always the staticflags flags
          to the CPPFLAGS. Previously we did this only when building the
          libraries, but then the executables get link errors. This fixes
          compile problems when using Cygwin or MinGW in a static build.

Sun Feb 29 14:04:41 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Framework_Component_DLL_Export.h:

Sat Feb 28 15:56:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:

Fri Feb 27 12:33:10 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/Event_Handler.cpp (add_reference and remove_reference):

          Previously, add_reference() and remove_reference() were called
          on a event handler only if the reference counting policy was
          enabled.  Unfortunately, this meant that at every place where
          add_reference() and remove_reference() were called, a check had
          to be made to see if the reference counting policy was enabled.
          It also meant that Event_Handler_var class could not be used
          with event handlers that do not enable the reference counting
          policy since the Event_Handler_var class was calling
          add_reference() and remove_reference() without checking the
          reference counting policy.

          So I modified the add_reference() and remove_reference() methods
          so that they check perform the necessary check for the reference
          counting policy.  This way the Event_Handler_var can be used
          without concern for whether the event handler has the reference
          counting policy enabled. Similarly, add_reference() and
          remove_reference() can also be called without concern for
          whether the event handler has the reference counting policy
          enabled.  Only in some places in the ACE library,
          remove_reference() cannot be called on the event handler because
          it might have been closed.  Therefore, an explicit check for the
          reference counting policy still needs to be performed.

          Reference counting in the following files was made simple
          because of above change:

          - ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp
          - ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp
          - ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp
          - ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp

          The tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp test was
          extended to check this change.

          Thanks to Dom Monteiro <d.monteiro@netia.net> and Liat
          (vliat1@hotmail.com) for pointing out this problem.

          Fixed a bug where 'specific' assignments were always added to
          existing values.  It did not allow for straight assignments or
          subtractions.  Now, specific assignments (additions and
          subtractions) are processed as they are read instead of at the end
          of the project.

          ACE_Output_Handler, add "using ACE_Service_Handler::open;" before
          declaring the override of it. Helps to disambiguate which open()
          we mean, ACE_Task::open(), or ACE_Service_Handler::open(). Sun
          Forte 8 complained about this ambiguity. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen

          Added a new keyword called pure_libs which is similar to lit_libs
          however no file extension is added to the name.  So, it is
          expected that the user will provide the complete library name when
          using pure_libs.

Mon Feb 23 16:08:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE_export.h:
          When using Cygwin and MinGW GCC version 3.3.1 or later we get dozens
          of warnings about methods that are defined locally after being
          referenced with dllimport. So, when using Cygwin or MinGW, when
          building with inlining enabled, make sure the methods in the ACE_OS
          namespace are marked as inline and not with dllimport. This fixes
          the warnings in the ACE_OS namespace but not the warnings in all
          other places. Thanks to Wu Yongwei <adah@netstd.com> for sending
          a fix for this.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx_panther.GNU:

          Added -mpcpu=G3 and -mtune=G4 to OCFLAGS. Mac OS X 10.3 requires
          a PowerPC G3 chip and hence this isn't adding any restrictions
          to ACE/TAO that the target platform doesn't already have for
          itself.  Thanks to Thomas Costa <oohrah@mac.com> for the
          patches.

        * ace/DEV_IO.i (recv_n):

          Using ACE::recv_n () created problems on Win32 serial port
          code. Now we call recv_n () on all platform on all platforms but
          Win32. On Win32 we call read_n () which works. Thanks to Philip

        * examples/C++NPv2/AC_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp:
          AC_Input_Handler::close() should accept a u_long, not u_int, to
          properly override ACE_Svc_Handler::close().
          AC_CLD_Connector::connect_svc_handler() first arg is a
          ACE_Svc_Handler*&, not ACE_Svc_Handler*, to properly override
          ACE_Connector::connect_svc_handler().
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for pointing these out.

Fri Feb 20 17:14:46 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/CDR_Base.{h,cpp} (NonNative LongLong and LongDouble):

          Added assignment operators for these two types.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (read_16):

          The function for reading a longdouble was adjusting and aligning
          the buffer to longlong size rather than to longdouble size.

Fri Feb 20 17:12:14 2004  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          SCTP_SEQ transport protocol only when the SCTP config flag is
          set.

          Removed these static msvc6 project files. Use MPC to generate these
          if you need them. These are outdated and should have gone before 1.4
          was released.

Fri Feb 20 18:47:26 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added FaultTolerance.dsp, RTCosScheduling and FtRtEvent.dsp to this
          file, so that they are build first with all other needed libs in the
          static builds.

Fri Feb 20 16:40:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Fri Feb 20 07:51:04 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * etc/ace.doxygen:

          Reverted the change "Sun Dec 28 15:09:34 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com>" since it broke stuff in
          ACE-categories.html. Don seems to have a better fix. Till
          then. This reversal will create problems for folks who untar
          doxygen documentation on platforms where the path length could
          be an issue.

Thu Feb 19 15:22:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Template_Instantiations.cpp: Add a block to keep HP aC++ from
          issuing a warning about an empty translation unit.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h: Added #include "ace/config-lite.h" because
          this file checks on config options.

        * ace/config-all.h: No need to include "ace/Global_Macros.h" from here.

        * ace/MEM_Addr.cpp (same_host): To account for IPv4/IPv6 differences,
          use ACE_INET_Addr::operator==. Because that method takes the port
          number into account when comparing, and we don't care about the
          port number, copy the two addresses to new ACE_INET_Addr objects
          and set their port numbers to 0, then compare.

        * tests/Multicast_Test_IPV6.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp: Corrected name of log file so
          the test script can find it.

Thu Feb 19 08:06:09 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (lstat): Removed the ACE_WIN32
          branch since Windows doesn't support _lstat().  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for this.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Added ACE_LACKS_LSTAT.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for this.

          Make all of the error and diagnostic messages go through the
          OutputMessage module.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made inheritance hierarchy information available to the project
          creator subclasses.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Increment the version number.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a problem with the implicit inter-project dependency
          generation code.  It now looks at indirect project dependency to
          avoid adding inter-project dependencies when they are not needed.
          This fixes [BUGID 1653].

Wed Feb 18 11:36:44 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Added a missing <%endif%>.

Wed Feb 18 10:41:07 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl: Removed an extra endif. Thanks to Don
          Hinton for sending the patch.

Wed Feb 18 07:04:55 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.{h,inl}: Changed the first parameter of
          lstat() to be ACE_TCHAR rather than just char and revised the
          #defines so things should work better on Windows.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp (dirent_count): Rearranged some
          code so the test would work.  Thanks to Zvika Ashani
          <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for reporting this and testing it.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Changed S_IFLNK to 0200000.
          Thanks to Zvika Ashani <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for reporting
          this and testing it.

Tue Feb 17 19:55:56 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.cpp:
          Add #include <ace/OS_NS_string.h> to get ACE_OS::memcpy().

Tue Feb 17 10:29:34 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added an environment variable,
          MPC_DEPENDENCY_COMBINED_STATIC_LIBRARY, to control the creation of
          inter-project dependencies of static libraries for the em3, vc6,
          vc7 and vc71 project types.  If the environment variable is set,
          MPC will generate inter-project dependencies for static libraries.
          Whereas, normally it would not.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VA4ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed a redundant version of the translate_value() method.

Mon Feb 16 08:06:23 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Changed the value of S_IFLNK so
          that it's different than S_IFREG.  Thanks to Zvika Ashani
          <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for reporting this.

Mon Feb 16 13:40:34 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qos.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/zlib.mpb:

          Added bmake to the specific sections for these base projects.

Sun Feb 15 16:34:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h:

          Fixed a typo that was causing compile errors on Win32.

Sun Feb 15 09:40:46 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Added a #define for
          S_IFLNK for Windows platforms, which lack this #define.  Thanks
          to Zvika Ashani for reporting this.

Sun Feb 15 10:00:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:

          Fixed unused function warnings.

Sat Feb 14 11:41:27 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl: Implement lstat() so that it'll
          use stat() on platforms that don't support lstat().

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp: Updated this test so it will
          illustrate how to recurse through a hierarchical directory
          structure.  Thanks to Zvika Ashani <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for
          helping to motivate this example and for providing the initial
          implementation.

Sat Feb 14 09:22:25 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/Makefile:
        * ace/TMCast/TMCast.mpc:

          Needs threads=1 to compile.

Sat Feb 14 08:48:10 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/Group.cpp:

          Fixed compile errors in daily builds.

Fri Feb 13 12:21:06 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait): If the
          ACE_Event_Handler::handle_exit() methods kills a managed
          process, the process_table_ array is modified before
          this->remove_proc (idx) is called. In this case the value of idx
          is wrong, so we replace remove_proc(idx) with remove(pid).
          Thanks to Carsten Prescher <carsten.prescher@sysde.eads.net> for
          reporting this.  This fixes bugid 1743.

Fri Feb 13 09:47:25 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (clone_from):

          The check that is done before we go for an allocation needs to
          include the CDR alignment.

        * ace/TMCast/Group.cpp:

          Use standard macros like ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX that can compile in
          single-threaded and multi-threaded builds. Thanks to Duane
          Binder for providing the patches.

Fri Feb 13 10:50:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Timers/Task.cpp: In main(), interval should be
          initialized with 100000 usecs, not 1000, to be .1 sec as the
          comment indicates. Thanks to Norm Whitehead
          <Norm_Whitehead@raytheon.com> for reporting this.

        * THANKS: Added Norm Whitehead to the Hall of Fame.

Thu Feb 12 10:40:40 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ACE-categories.html:

          Fixed the url location. But the file names will not work since
          we have broken the  name generation in doxygen. We will fix that
          next.

Thu Feb 12 09:34:37 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Added the ACE_PLATFORM_CONFIG environment variable to the
          replacement list.  I'm not sure why this is desirable, but g++dep
          does it so now depgen.pl does it.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUDependencyWriter.pm:

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/ObjectGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Made many optimizations to compensate for the additional
          replacement variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/fault_tolerance.mpb:

          The fault_tolerance base project needs the ftorb base project.

Wed Feb 11 16:25:11 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (get_host_addr): On Windows for IPv6, don't try
          to call ACE_OS::inet_ntop() - it's not supported. The rough
          equivalent is getnameinfo(). Rather than add this at the ACE_OS
          layer after BFO (getnameinfo() may have been replaced by newer
          APIs in other OSes) add the getnameinfo() call in here.
          This fixes the crash in INET_Addr_Test on Windows w/ IPv6.

Wed Feb 11 13:14:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test_IPV6.cpp: Cast INADDR_ANY to ACE_UINT32 to
          disambiguate it from a 0 char*. Fixes compile error on Windows.

Wed Feb 11 15:39:29 GMT 2004  Paul Morrison  <epm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigAction.cpp

          Added a reinterpret_cast to fix a build error with LynxOS.

Wed Feb 11 15:31:06 GMT 2004  Paul Morrison  <epm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Basic_Logging_Service/Makefile

        * TAO/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service/Makefile
        * TAO/orbsvcs/examples/Log/RTEvent/Makefile

          Added -lTAO_Svc_Utils to LDLIBS line to remove link errors with
          LynxOS build.

Wed Feb 11 07:36:16 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.rel:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Added the ability to use wildcards in the default.rel file.  For
          example, *_ROOT is now used to pick up all environment variables
          that end in _ROOT.

Tue Feb 10 13:32:51 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Proactor/HA_Proactive_Status.cpp: Add ACE_TEXT
          around string literal and make the "need async I/O" message
          more explicit.

Tue Feb 10 11:27:59 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/bison.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/flex.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/lex.mpb:

          Added base projects with custom definitions for bison, flex and
          lex.  Currently, yacc can't be supported since the output file
          can't be explicitly specified.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the line number to an informational message.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed this template to allow source files to exist within
          sub-directories, but have the object files go in the build
          directory.

Tue Feb 10 15:51:50 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Even if the user overrides PLATFORM_SCTP_CPPFLAGS in
          platform_macros.GNU, either ACE_HAS_OPENSS7_SCTP or
          ACE_HAS_LKSCTP *must* be added to PLATFORM_SCTP_CPPFLAGS, otherwise
          wrong code will get compiled.  Also, for sctp=lksctp, do
          not hardcode PLATFORM_SCTP_LIBS to /usr/local/lib/libsctp.a.
`         Instead set PLATFORM_SCTP_LDFLAGS to -L/usr/local/lib
          and set PLATFORM_SCTP_LIBS to -lsctp.

Tue Feb 10 08:45:10 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in the template where no binary targets would be built
          if there are no libraries linked in.

Tue Feb 10 07:29:55 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.h:

          #included ace/os_include/os_errno.h. Needed for builds where
          ACE_HAS_SIGNAL_SAFE_OS_CALLS is defined. Thanks to Kobi
          Cohen-Arazi for the patch.

Mon Feb  9 18:21:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Naming/Name_Binding.h: The Name_Binding destructor
          should use ACE_OS::free(), not delete[], to release type_. It
          was allocated using ACE_OS::strdup().

Mon Feb  9 16:10:07 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp: ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool::commit_backing_store_name()
          and ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool::handle_signal() ACE_ERROR_RETURN
          macros were returning the wrong value (0 instead of -1).  Thanks
          to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi-co@barak-online.net> for reporting
          this problem.

Mon Feb  9 13:58:30 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUObjectGenerator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where cpp files in subdirectories would have the wrong
          target name generated in the dependencies.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Removed an unnecessary directory in the include search path.

Mon Feb  9 10:31:40 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          If the file for which dependencies are being generated contains a
          directory name, then we need to look for include files in that
          directory.

Mon Feb  9 07:00:05 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Added the custom generated files to the realclean target.

Sun Feb  8 15:36:30 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Just added the 1,800th contributor to the THANKS file!!

Sun Feb  8 15:34:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Also generate a realclean target for the IDL files so that IDL
          generated files are removed when running a realclean.

Sun Feb  8 14:25:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:
          Added first version support of using the Cygwin compiler within
          the CBuilderX Development Environment

Sun Feb  8 14:02:53 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:
          Added MinGW support for in the CBuilderX IDE

Sun Feb  8 13:06:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:
          Improved the CBuilderX template. Don't compile template files and
          disabled some warnings.

Sat Feb  7 19:33:56 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/RMCast/Send_File/Sender.cpp (ACE_TMAIN):
          Fixed a typo in the comments.  Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi>
          for the patch.

Fri Feb  6 15:49:37 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:

          Added TAO_ROOT/tao and CIAO_ROOT/ciao to the include
          paths (C++ and (C)IDL). These additions allow users
          to include <orb.idl> or <Components.idl> without
          being concerned about the specific directory they
          reside in.

Fri Feb  6 14:53:27 2004  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          Added a new feature cidl into the global features.
          This feature is turned off by default, so no makefiles
          or project files will be gnerated for CCF and CIDLC.

Fri Feb  6 14:13:25 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl (msec): Changed the return type of
          ACE_Time_Value::msec() from long to unsigned long to prevent
          problems with wrap-arounds that yield negative numbers.  Thanks
          to Matthew Gillen <gillen@ohio.edu> for this fix.

Fri Feb  6 11:50:36 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:

          Fixes a problem that this change "Thu Jan 15 08:02:23 2004
          Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>" opened up and which
          Craig Rodrigues reported. This problem has been lying around for
          almost an year now. In the static method
          get_port_number_from_name (), if we get a portnumber 0
          (perfectly valid to send a 0) we missed to check for port
          0. This has now been fixed. Thanks to Craig for reporting this.

Fri Feb  6 09:48:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):

          Reverted the change "Fri Feb  6 09:31:30 2004  Balachandran
          Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" since it creates more
          problems.

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:

          Added ACE_LACKS_SWAB. This is a lie. There are signatures
          mismatch and adding compile time options that get the right
          signatures messes things up a lot. Someone needs to take a look
          at it fix the compile time options properly.

Fri Feb  6 09:35:13 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventlogadmin.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from dslogadmin and rtoldevent instead of
          dseventlogadmin.

Fri Feb  6 09:31:30 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):

          Added -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED=1 to
          CPPFLAGS. This should fix the compile errors in Solaris builds.

Fri Feb  6 09:04:50 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Added support for dynamicflags, staticflags and rc files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added the _REENTRANT macro to the extracppflags for many of the
          platforms.

Fri Feb  6 06:35:32 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Updated the usage to reflect the new Cbx workspace type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/CbxWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MWC.pm:

          Added the workspace counterpart to the CbxProjectCreator.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for providing me an example workspace.

Fri Feb  6 11:48:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Fixed typo in this file which caused build problems when .rc are
          used (Cygwin and MinGW do this).

Thu Feb  5 13:38:15 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Added rules for all of the MPC supported C++ file extensions.

Thu Feb  5 11:25:50 2004  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Modified build rules to allow projects with sources in sub-
          directoris. Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
          for his help.

Thu Feb  5 08:48:27 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.{h,cpp}: added a new methods called
          testterminate() which checks to see whether a thread has
          terminated or not.  Thanks to Avi Ouziel <ouziel_a@hotmail.com>
          for this suggestion.

Thu Feb  5 07:55:10 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where Borland projects generated on UNIX would not
          reflect the correct cppdir value.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Sort the projects names so projects are easier to find in large
          lists.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Fixed a bug in the usage output.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Updated the MPC version number.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Updated the usage to reflect the new alternative Borland Make

          Added a new alternative Borland Make project type called bmake.
          It does not rely on any of the .bor files in
          ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stdlib.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h:
          Moved the prototypes for getopt() and putenv() out of

Wed Feb  4 18:15:16 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU: Allow
          user to override SCTP flags in platform_macros.GNU
          before including platform_linux.GNU.

Wed Feb  4 17:41:25 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_freebsd.GNU:
          Change thread flags to reflect new changes in FreeBSD.
          KSE-based -lpthread is now the default library in
          FreeBSD-CURRENT.

Tue Feb  3 16:21:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4: If --disable-rtti is specified on AIX, add
          -DACE_LACKS_RTTI to CXXFLAGS.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Makefile.am:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile.am: Removed the
          extraneous path prefix for the required same-directory libraries in
          main_LDADD to allow the Makefile to see the library and build it
          first at make time.

Tue Feb  3 07:37:20 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Added a missing foreach for the configurations.  It's necessary in
          order to access the platforms.

Mon Feb  2 13:53:08 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/OutputMessage.pm:

          Added an interface for printing informational, warning and error
          messages.  This allows messages to be manipulated prior to being
          printed.  Informational messages are off by default and can be
          enabled by setting the MPC_INFORMATION environment variable.  The
          informational and warning messages can be turned off by setting the
          MPC_SILENT environment variable.

Mon Feb  2 13:48:23 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:

          Move the location of the custom build rules to ensure that they
          are added to the all target before the object files.  This ensures
          that the custom build rules are processed before source files are
          compiled.

Mon Feb 02 10:00:29 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-6.h:

          Looks like VC6 has a non-const swab.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Fixed the non-const part of the swab () to compile with vc6.

Mon Feb  2 08:18:41 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/CbxProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed an unused implementation of the fill_value() method.

          Removed the ssl and defaultlibs keyword.  These were unncessary
          and should have been removed long ago.

Mon Feb  2 07:16:42 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Changed the parameters to void * instead of char * since most of
          the platforms take a void *.

Mon Feb  2 06:56:32 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.ace:

          Building applications which use ACE library fail because
          LynxOS's linker is unable to find dlopen() which is used in
          DLL_Manager.o and implemented in OS_NS_dlfcn.o.

          To fix this, OS_NS_dlfcn.o must be placed after DLL_Manager.o
          when creating libACE.a with ar. Thanks to Olli Savia for the
          patch.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
        * ace/README:
          Some platforms have a swab function where the first argument is
          non const, added ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SWAB which then must be set.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SWAB

Sun Feb  1 15:15:44 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Added missing libraries that are needed when linking with fltk
          support.

Sun Feb  1 12:36:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/build_lib.bor:
          Added support for using the CBX ar with the -M commandline option
          to pass it a script. This fixes the too long commandline.

Sat Jan 31 11:01:33 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Thanks to Olli Savia, we now have a ACE_OS::swab (). This calls
          the platform specific swab () function. There is a emulation
          which could be used on platforms that don't support ::swab
          (). The emulation can be used by defining ACE_LACKS_SWAB.

          I haven't added ACE_LACKS_SWAB in any config file. We will do it
          as and when things showup in our daily builds.

Sat Jan 31 08:52:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/smart_proxies.mpb:

          only prevents the smart_proxies tests from compiling

Fri Jan 30 19:33:49 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU: Allow user to override

          any of the cpp files.

Fri Jan 30 09:02:30 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp (proactor_run_event_loop): Make sure to
          return if the handle_events() call return 0, which indicates
          a timeout.  Thanks to Daniel Buchs <acelib@dbux.ch> for
          this fix.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MWC.pm:
        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Pulled the creator lists out of the perl scripts and moved them
          into the new MPC and MWC modules.  This will allow the extension
          of MPC by providing a way to hook new workspace and project types
          into MPC without adding anything to the MPC repository.

Thu Jan 29 14:10:51 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the workspace output to allow a user to make a specific
          target within the workspace.  If the user specified target
          requires other projects, then those projects are built also.  For
          example, a user could execute "nmake CosNaming" using the Makefile
          generated from the TAOACE.mwc file and the CosNaming library
          would be built including everything else that was required to
          build that library.

          Removed IDL_Files as a built-in build type and replaced it as a
          custom build type.  The syntax of IDL_Files has only changed in
          that idlgendir is no longer a usable keyword.  gendir should be
          used in its place.  Additionally, the custom build rules can not
          be executed in parallel when using the GNUACE project type.  This
          does not stop multiple unrelated projects from being built in
          parallel.  In order to get the IDL custom build type, your project
          must inherit, either directly or indirectly, from taoidldefaults.
          The amh, ciao_client, taoexe and taolib_with_idl base projects all
          inherit from taoidldefaults.  Others get it indirectly.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/idl_compiler.mpt:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added custom build output inference that takes gendir settings
          into account.  If a custom build file is listed, gendir is set and
          the generated source isn't listed in the Source_Files list, then
          the correct generated source files will be listed with the correct
          path determined by gendir.

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Moved os_math.h include from config-cygwin32.h to ACE.h. When
          ACE_NTRACE is set we got include problems. Cygwin defines log2
          as macro and we have ACE::log2. The include of os_math.h is only
          done for Cygwin.  Thanks to Yi Zuo <Yi.Zuo@alcatel-sbell.com.cn>

Mon Jan 26 17:12:38 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (filesize): Declare sb using ACE_stat instead

          The CBuilderX Preview compiler uses the .o extension for object
          files, all other Borland versions use .obj. Some time ago I
          introduced $(OBJ_EXT) to handle this, but this was not complete
          yet. Change the makefile instructure to handle $(OBJ_EXT) instead
          of obj and changed the MPC Borland template to generate $(OBJ_EXT)
          instead of obj. This way everything works as normally, but when
          you use the new CBuilderX Preview environment you must regenerate
          your makefiles using MPC.

Mon Jan 26 09:35:51 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          When calling the prelink script, the object files should be in

          Moved the ACE_TRACE defines from Global_Macros.h to config-all.
          and ACE_OS_TRACE from config-lite.h to config-all.h, and added
          ACE_OS_NTRACE to config-all.h with the same symantics.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for motivating this
          change.

        * examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Options.cpp:

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          Some cosmetic fixes to get ACEXEML and Kokyu compiled well
          before other things. The dsw's in TAO hierarchy do not have the
          dsp's of ACE hierarchy included but for TAOACE.dsw.

Sun Jan 25 08:59:40 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.mwc:
        * ACEXML/ACEXML.mwc:

          Added new workspace files. The above pieces should be compilable
          without going into TAO and using TAOACE.mwc.

Sun Jan 25 12:26:19 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Auto_IncDec_Test.cpp:
          Extended debug info with the total number of threads. This then shows
          that with Cygwin threads that exit are not removed from the

          Cleaned up some old stuff

Sat Jan 24 16:11:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:
          With CBuilderX Preview putenv, wcstod, wcstol and wcstoul are in the
          std namespace, so added ACE_STD_NAMESPACE which expands to std with
          Borland, to nothing with other compilers.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:
          The vswprintf for Dinkum STL is different. CBuilderX Preview has
          std::tempnam, so added checking for borland version.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp:
          vswprintf and vsnprintf are different with CBuilderX Preview

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the defaulting rules for implicitly adding source files
          when IDL_Files (or any other custom type) is specified.
          Previously, generated source files would only be added to the
          Source_Files section only if IDL_Files was not specified and no
          generated source files were already listed in Source_Files.  Now,
          the generated source files will be added whether or not IDL_Files
          is specified and no generated source files were already listed in
          Source_Files.

Fri Jan 23 19:09:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp:
          With CBuilderX Preview strdup is in the std namespace, so
          added ACE_STD_NAMESPACE which expands to std with Borland,
          to nothing with other compilers.

Fri Jan 23 10:04:00 2004  Gary Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com>

        Fix for BUGID 1722, for Tandem NSK platform.
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:

          Need to use spt_system() instead of system().

Fri Jan 23 10:30:12 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Exclude .exp files and ensure that we can stat() the real file
          before checking the modification time in
          backup_and_copy_changed().

Fri Jan 23 09:41:11 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Reverted my change from Tue Jan 20 14:11:48 2004.  While the
          generated vcproj loads properly, the project does not link
          properly.

Fri Jan 23 10:47:54 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Another set of changes for CBuilderX. strcasecmp and strncasecmp
          should come from the std namespace

Fri Jan 23 10:04:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:

          needed anymore for the CBuilderX Preview compiler

Fri Jan 23 09:42:15 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
          Dinkum STL doesn't have tzset. Fixes another compile problem with
          the new Borland CBuilderX Preview compiler

Fri Jan 23 09:36:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
          CBuilderX Preview defines _MSC_VER and __BORLANDC__ so only use
          _CrtSetReportMode when _MSC_VER is defined and not __BORLANDC__.
          Borland isn't making thing easier to maintain.

Fri Jan 23 09:30:45 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-borland-common.h:

        * ace/os_include/os_time.h:
          Dinkum STL doesn't have timezone or _timezone so only try to use
          timezone when we don't have Dinkum STL.

Fri Jan 23 07:38:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/README:
        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:
          Added ace_timezone implementation for use with Dinkum STL, which
          lacks _timezone. For this added ACE_HAS_DINKUM_STL which can be
          set when using the Dinkum STL version.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          The new CBuilderX preview compiler uses Dinkum STL, so se then
          ACE_HAS_DINKUM_STL

Thu Jan 22 19:57:59 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.am (install-data-local):

Thu Jan 22 19:08:56 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (mkdir):

          ACE_OS::mkdir for OS PSOS wrote one character behind allocated
          memory. Fixed it by adding an extra byte for allocation. Thanks
          to Dieter Knueppel <dknueppel@datus.com> for reporting the
          problem and suggesting a fix.

Thu Jan 22 19:00:50 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h:

          This patch fixes redeclaration of pthread_sigmask
          function which showe up RH 9 systems with glibc
          2.3. pthread_sigmask declaration is now protected by a guard
          which will be defined in the platform configuration file. Thanks
          to Olli Savia for providing the patch.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          A fix similar to this fix "Wed Jan 21 13:38:11 UTC 2004  Johnny
          Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>", but added
          ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SIGMASK_PROTO within the block for glib 2.3.

Thu Jan 22 19:02:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/Task_ThreadPool.cpp: Use 0, not NULL, to
          initialize a pointer.

Thu Jan 22 18:08:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/ThreadPool.cpp: Don't ACE_ASSERT action
          that needs to be performed regardless of the ACE_NDEBUG setting.

Thu Jan 22 13:25:49 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.7.h:

          Define ACE_LACKS_GETLOADAVG in config-sunos5.5.h since SunOS 5.5
          and 5.6 do not have getloadavg().  Undefine it in
          config-sunos5.7.h, since it has it.

Wed Jan 22 10:33:47 2004  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/wxwindows.mpb
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          Fixed wxwindows base project in support
          of $TAO_ROOT/util/wxNamingViewer.
          wxwindows project now require wxWindows defined
          (in plaform_macros.GNU) as was since 12/1/00
          instead of wxwindows. I choose historical precidence
          over making the macro and project name both
          being all lower case.

          Note: The wxNamingViewer Makefile was overriding the
          PLATFORM_WX_* macros defined in platform_*.GNU so I updated the
          macros in platform_*.GNU to be like the overrides in the Makefile.
          These macros are based on the wxWindows configuration.
          The wxNamingViewer makefile contains the only use of these
          macros.

          Only tested on RedHat 9 with wx_gtk 2.4.2.

          Note - the platform_*.GNU files definition of PLATFORM_WX_*
                 only support wxWindows over GTK+.
          TBD - support wxWindows MSVC and Borland in wxwindows.mpc.

          Added "netsvcs" directory to the list of subdirectories to
          recurse.

        * netsvcs/Makefile.am:

          Reverted a series of changes that somehow left this file in an
          inconsistent state in our CVS repository, and unparsable by
          Automake.  In particular, it incorrectly contained
          Borland-specific Makefile code.

          Updated to our latest Makefile.am conventions.

        * netsvcs/clients/Makefile.am:
        * netsvcs/clients/Logger/Makefile.am:

        * tests/Makefile.am:

          Added more missing header files to appropriate source file
          lists.  Missing files were made evident when running a "make
          distcheck".

Wed Jan 21 20:12:38 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (ACE_CONFIG_COMMANDS):

          Include ACE version in configuration completion message to
          improve clarity.

Wed Jan 21 20:17:34 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue.i: Fixed ACE_Message_Queue_NT::is_empty()
          so that it returns the right result.  Thanks to Ariel Peltz
          <Arielp@bigbandnet.com> for contributing this fix.

Wed Jan 21 13:28:41 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac:

          Do not rely on "ace/OS.cpp" when performing test that determines
          if the generated configuration is usable.  "ace/OS.cpp" has been
          superseded by and split off into several other files.  Addresses
          bogus ACE usability configure script errors when running a "make
          distcheck".

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Added missing "-version-number" libtool flag for all subset
          libraries.  Fixes problem where the library version for all
          these libraries was "0.0.0".  Thanks to Robert Schiele
          <robert.schiele@t-online.de> for discovering the problem and for
          providing a fix.

          (libACE_Utils_la_SOURCES):

          Added Template_Instantiations.cpp file to this source list.
          Fixes a "missing file" problem revealed by a "distcheck".

          (HEADER_FILES, INLINE_FILES, TEMPLATE_FILES):

          Updated these source file lists.  Addresses "missing file"
          problems exhibited when performing a "make distcheck".

        * m4/acinclude.m4 (ACE_USE_TEMP_FILE):

          Fixed problem that prevented the "distcheck" target from passing
          due to an attempt to write a file into a read-only directory.

        * tests/Makefile.am (Multihomed_INET_Addr_Test_SOURCES):

          Removed "Multihomed_INET_Addr_Test.h" from this source file
          list.  That file doesn't exist.  Detected when performing a
          "make distcheck".

          (libService_Config_DLL_la_SOURCES, libTest_Output_la_SOURCES):

          Added missing Service_Config_DLL_Export.h and
          Test_Output_Export.h file to these test's source lists,
          respectively.  Addresses problem revealed by a "distcheck".

          (lib_LTLIBRARIES)

          Added missing Framework_Component_DLL library to the list of
          libraries to build.

Wed Jan 21 13:37:20 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          Added gperf to the list of workspaces that needs compilation
          upfront as part of core.

Wed Jan 21 13:38:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          glibc version 2.3 defines the method isastream, so from this
          glibc version don't do this anymore in the ACE library by
          setting then the define ACE_HAS_ISASTREAM_PROTO. On RH9 defining
          the isastream method within ACE caused errors because there this
          method has an exception specification. This only appeared when
          other libraries are used which include stropts.h themselves.
          Also on SuSE 9 with glibc v2.3 I see that isastream has an
          exception specification. This fixed [BUGID 1613].  Thanks to
          Jeffrey Graham <jgraham@titan.com> and Akim Boyko
          <akim@sitech.com.ua> for reporting this.

Wed Jan 21 12:58:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Removed the setting of MWMO_ALERTABLE when using MinGW. This is
          set already by MinGW a long time.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:
        * ace/README:
          MinGW delivers a dirent.h which has opendir, closedir, readdir,
          etc. Because in the OS_NS_dirent files always on win32 is assumed
          that we haven't these methods, introduces ACE_LACKS_OPENDIR,
          ACE_LACKS_CLOSEDIR and ACE_LACKS_READDIR. These defines are set
          in config-win32-common and undef'd in config-win32-mingw.h.
          So, on MinGW we use the normal opendir/closedir/readdir, the other
          environmens in win32 use the corresponding emulation methods. This
          fixes [BUGID 1718]. Thanks to Matthew Grosso <mgrosso@acm.org>
          for reporting this and supplying the patches.

Tue Jan 20 19:58:03 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac:

          Replaced all uses of the "changequote" M4 built-in with proper
          quoting.  Use of "changequote" is very discouraged by autoconf
          developers since it is often a source of M4 programming
          problems.

          (ACE_VERSION, AC_INIT):

          Statically determine the version of ACE using M4 built-ins at
          autoconf-time, instead of dynamically setting the ACE version in
          a shell variable at configure-time.  This allows the package
          version to be set in the autoconf AC_INIT call since AC_INIT
          expects a static value.

          Replaced "TEST-VERSION" version value passed to AC_INIT call
          with new ACE_VERSION macro.  This allows the correct package
          version, e.g. "5.4" instead of "TEST-VERSION", to be propagated
          to a number of places within the configure script itself, and
          Makefile.in templates generated by Automake.  For example,
          "configure --help" and "configure --version" now display the
          correct version of ACE.

          (ACE_CURRENT, ACE_AGE, ACE_REVISION):

          Removed all kludges that worked around libtool's versioning
          scheme.  Libtool 1.5 or better now provides a means to set a
          package defined library version.  Thanks to Robert Schiele
          <robert.schiele@t-online.de> pointing out the new libtool
          feature.

        * bin/bootstrap:

          Cleaned up obsolete comments and commented code.

          Force auxiliary files to be copied to prevent older versions
          from being used with newer versions autotools that expect newer
          versions of the auxiliary files.

          Clarified some progress messages so that it is obvious that
          bootstrapping corresponds to ACE autotool support.

        * m4/ace.m4:
        * m4/acinclude.m4:
        * m4/compiler.m4:
        * m4/platform.m4:

          Replaced all uses of the "changequote" M4 built-in with proper
          quoting.  Use of "changequote" is very discouraged by autoconf
          developers since it is often a source of M4 programming
          problems.

        * ace/Makefile.am (libACE_la_LDFLAGS):

          Use new libtool 1.5 "-version-number" option instead of
          "-version-info" to override libtool's versioning scheme with
          ACE's versioning scheme.  Thanks to Robert Schiele
          <robert.schiele@t-online.de> pointing out the new libtool
          feature.

        * ace/RMCast/Makefile.am (libACE_RMCast_la_LDFLAGS):
        * ace/SSL/Makefile.am (libACE_SSL_la_LDFLAGS):

          Set ACE_RMCast and ACE_SSL library versions to ACE library
          version, instead of not setting at all (defaulting to 0.0.0).
          This is consistent with our stock/classical ACE build
          Makefiles.

Tue Jan 20 16:57:54 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Active_Map_Manager.i:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:

          Fixed warnings in VC71 builds. Thanks to Grutzmacher
          Lukas<gruetzmacher@ais-dresden.de> for reporting the problem and
          providing patches.

Tue Jan 20 15:37:18 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          Fixed some typos in the comments.

Mon Jan 19 18:49:50 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          This is a new auto_compile script for MSVC with MPC. This just
          build DLL's for both debug and release versions. The old file
          msvc_auto_compile.pl is age old and suffers from severe brain
          hemorrage which is hard to rectify with simple band aids and
          stuff. The old file simply needs to go. This new script will be
          used completely for DLL builds after testing in our daily
          builds.

Tue Jan 20 14:11:48 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added support for file grouping in these templates.  If source
          files are grouped in the mpc file, they will show up grouped in
          the graphical interfaces for these project types.

Tue Jan 20 12:20:35 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the all target wouldn't be generated if the
          platform is capable of shared libraries but the user only wants
          static libraries.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Rearranged some of the VxWorks related settings.

Tue Jan 20 18:02:19 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Made some small corrections.

Tue Jan 20 17:05:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          When using BCB6 and release builds we get errors about __strcmp__ is
          undefined. This is caused by the optimizer of BCB6 which generates
          code for common functions like strcpy() within the calling function's
          scope. The compiler flag is -Oi and this is set when the complete -O2
          optimization options is passed. So, with BCB6 in release builds,
          we don't set -O2, but set all specific optimization flags but just not
          -Oi. This is the only way I could fix this.

Tue Jan 20 16:00:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added support for the Cygwin 1.5.6-1 version

Mon Jan 19 13:31:46 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Makefile: In AUTOCONF_RELEASE_FILES, changed aux to aux_config to
          match: Fri Jan 16 12:29:48 2004  Ossama Othman.

Mon Jan 19 17:27:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release:
          Dfm files shouldn't get LF->CRLF conversions. Thanks to
          Martin Kaul <mkaul@leuze.de> for reporting this.

Mon Jan 19 10:46:51 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GUID.pm:

          Mask the 4 byte portions of the GUID with 0xffffffff to avoid
          problems with 64-bit versions of Cygwin Perl.  Thanks to Cristian
          Ferretti <cristian_ferretti@yahoo.com> for reporting this and
          providing a fix.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support for VxWorks 5.5 PPC and PENTIUM.

Mon Jan 19 15:59:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Tests.bor:
          Added missing FIFO_Test. Thanks to Peter Bekiesch

Mon Jan 19 08:07:02 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where files added to the Template_Files section were
          not removed from the Source_Files section due to differences in
          slashes to backslashes.

Mon Jan 19 07:24:16 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Misc/test_XtReactor1.cpp:
        * examples/Misc/test_XtReactor2.cpp:

          Removed #define for String (added back in '96).  The workaround is
          apparently no longer needed.  Also fixed some build errors and
          warnings.

Mon Jan 19 10:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

Sun Jan 18 15:32:59 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Added patches from Viktor Ransmayr<viktor.ransmayr@t-online.de>
          for a documentation patch, which describes how to build ACE
          using only the MinGW and MSYS package.

Sun Jan 18 10:27:11 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/RT_CORBA_Leader_Follower.cpp:

          Used ACE_UINT64_DBLCAST_ADAPTER  instead of direct casting to a
          double to be more portable.

Sun Jan 18 10:13:16 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          #included fstream conditionally on VC6. This should fix the
          remaining compile errors on VC6 with MPC builds.

Sun Jan 18 09:48:03 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/TMCast/member.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation errors with VC6 which stemmed due to the
          fact that a unsigned long long was used. We use ACE_UINT64
          instead.

Sun Jan 18 09:40:04 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:
          Added tests/Test_Output.dsp to the list of libs to be build first
          when building statically. Removed the code for the non-MPC static
          build, the projects for this are removed before the 1.4 release.

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added tests/Test_Output.dsp to the list of libs to be build first.

Sun Jan 18 08:52:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Sat Jan 17 19:19:33 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/ASNMP_Export.h:

          Added missing ASNMP_Export macro.

          This fixes several build problems on Win32. Thanks to
          Michelangelo Nottoli <m.nottoli@acsys.it> for reporting this
          and supplying the ideas how to fix this.

Sat Jan 17 18:43:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:
        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          When using static projects we cannot use the dependencies between
          different libraries. Therefor we have to explicitly define the
          build order. The existing msvc_auto_compile.pl script was getting
          to complex, so added a new msvc_static_compile.pl script that will
          be used for building statically. In the msvc_static_order.lst the
          order of building can be specified.

Sat Jan 17 09:46:38 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          The fix for the ec_typed_events feature. Thanks to Chad Elliot for
          explaining that MPC inheritance is based on file name. So CosEvent.mpc
          inherits from ec_typed_events in the orbsvcs directory, projects using
          event inherit from event which inherits from ec_use_typed_events
          which then sets the needed compiler flags and adds the needed
          libraries to the linker.

Fri Jan 16 15:04:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (close): Set the this->if_list_
          field to 0 to let applications close and re-open the socket.
          Without it, a second close will delete already delete'd memory.
          Thanks to Shannon Barber <shannon.barber@myrealbox.com> for
          this fix.

Fri Jan 16 12:29:48 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR):

          Changed auxiliary directory filename from "aux" to
          "aux_config".  The former is not an allowed/valid name on
          Windows.  Thanks to Greg Mulyar <greg_mu@yahoo.com> for pointing
          out the problem.

Fri Jan 16 14:19:14 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Fixed the project names in MPC to be similar to the ones used in
          default distribution. Thanks to Boris Kaminer
          <boris_kaminer@mail.ru> for motivating this fix.

Fri Jan 16 16:09:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event.mpb:
          Removed ec_typed_events as base. This resulted in problems in
          building other orbsvcs which then use the ec_typed_events.mpb
          which is located in $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs/orbsvcs. This restores
          the situation to the previous situation and in meantime we can
          figure out a better solution.

Fri Jan 16 15:01:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp:
          For checking if we are building statically use ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS and
          not ACE_HAS_STATIC_LIBS. With this fix this tests runs again in the
          BCB6 static build.

Fri Jan 16 11:27:01 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Service_Config_DLL_Export.h:
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Fri Jan 16 11:25:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/Svc_Config/HASTATUS_export.h
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Fri Jan 16 09:57:45 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/DLL_Test.bor:
        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp:
          Changed this test so that it works in MPC and non-MPC builds.
          We use always the decorator string for the dll name.

Fri Jan 16 08:56:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ec_typed_events.mpb:
          Added this file. When the feature ec_typed_events is available,
          we must link with the IFRClient and DynamicInterface library.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event.mpb:
          Add ec_typed_events as parent project. When ec_typed_events is
          available projects using event should link with the extra needed
          libraries. This fixes the link errors in the BCB6 Static build.

Thu Jan 15 20:54:38 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac:

          Require GNU Autoconf 2.58 or better, not 2.57g or better.
          Version 2.57g was a testing release not a stable release.

          Use more comprehensive (custom) test for detecting shm_open()
          support instead of AC_CHECK_FUNC.  In particular, use
          AC_LINK_IFELSE so that we can detect missing function prototype
          errors.  Addresses a problem on Solaris builds where shm_open()
          support was incorrectly detected as available despite the fact
          POSIX.1b support was not enabled.

          Removed ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION test.  This macro is
          no longer used.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_resource.h:

          Include <sys/procfs.h> in the ACE_HAS_PROC_FS case.  It is
          necessary to pull in the "prusage_t" typedef.  That typedef is
          used later in this header.  Addresses an ACE+autoconf build
          problem on Solaris.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Corrected quoting problem that caused "--enable-fast" help
          string to be echoed incorrectly.

        * m4/acinclude.m4:

          Corrected typo in warning message.

        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Updated Sun C++ 5.0 configuration settings to match those in the
          latest platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU file.

        * m4/config_h.m4 (AH_BOTTOM):

          Added empty line to text appended to generated `config.h' file
          to correct a "non-empty ending line" warning exhibited by Sun
          C++ 5.0.

          (ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION):

          Removed template for this preprocessor macro.  It is no longer
          used.

Thu Jan 15 20:33:09 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ACE-development-process.html (HREF):

          Added a small writeup about the features of BFO.

Thu Jan 15 19:47:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/avstreams.mpb:
          Avstreams uses the feature qos, so when qos=1 is set in the
          default.features file we use the ACE_QoS library. Projects
          using avstreams should also use this feature, so that they also
          link with ACE_QoS when qos=1. This fixes link errors in the
          BCB6 Static Build.

Thu Jan 15 18:50:42 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile problem in BCB6 Unicode build

Thu Jan 15 18:42:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portablegroup.mpb:
          PortableGroup uses iormanip, so also projects using portablegroup
          need this. This fixes the compile problems in the BCB6 Static
          build.

Thu Jan 15 18:33:16 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/C++NPv1/Process_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp:
          Use ACE_OS::strcpy instead of strcpy to fix compile problem in
          BCB6 Static build.

Thu Jan 15 11:12:45 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt-min_moc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Removed the command options from the command setting and put them
          into the commandflags settings.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:

          Added the initial support for custom build types.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in this template where the !ENDIF for custom build
          types would be missing.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Added user dependencies for custom build types.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Fixed the user dependencies for custom build types such that it is
          not hard coded to be the CIAO IDL compiler for all custom build
          types.

Thu Jan 15 16:47:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcorbacommon.mpb:
          The rtcorbacommon library needs portableserver and doesn't build
          when minimum_corba is set

Thu Jan 15 08:02:23 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (get_port_number_from_name): Changed
          initial value of port_number from 0 to -1.  Thanks to
          Stephen Moon <stephenm@sychron.com> for this fix.

Thu Jan 15 16:06:54 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Export/test_export.h:
        * ace/TMCast/Export.hpp:
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Thu Jan 15 16:03:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/Bounded_Packet_Relay.mpc:
        * examples/Synch/Synch.mpc:
          Added new mpc files for these examples

Thu Jan 15 08:14:08 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added documentation for keyword mapping which will allow users to
          map custom defined keywords into the project level scope.
          Removed support for the idlpreprocessor keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core.mpb:

          Changed core = 1 into a verbatim clause that enbles the removal of
          the core keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcpartialmacros.mpt:

          Removed the ACE specific precompiled headers macro.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:

          Propagated change from GNUACEProjectCreator on Wed Jan  7 06:24:54

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
          Added support for keyword mapping which will allow users to map
          custom defined keywords into the project level scope.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the workspace output to allow a user to make a specific
          target within the workspace.  If the user specified target
          requires other projects, then those projects are built also.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Updated the version number of MPC.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Warn about circular dependencies between projects.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:

          Added verbatim markers, removed the use of the core keyword in
          favor of the verbatim used to get the same effect.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in this template where TAO_ORBSVCS was not being
          handled properly.
          Removed the use of the idlpreprocessor keyword in favor of the
          verbatim used to get the same effect.
