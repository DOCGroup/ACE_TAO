Our <A HREF="task.cpp">Task</A> object definition.
<P>
Something to look at here is the ACE_Barrier usage.  In the
constructor, we tell the barrier how many threads we're using.  Then,
in the svc() method, we use the barrier's wait() method.  You can
think of the barrier as a semaphore initialized to the thread count.
  Each time wait()
is invoked, the semaphore is decremented and the thread is blocked.
  When the count equals zero, all threads are unblocked and allowed to
continue.
<P>
<font size=-1>Note:  This isn't the way ACE_Barrier really works, it's
just an analogy</font>

<P>
This is all pretty straight-forward too.  One gottcha we avoided was a memory leak
due to our shutdown message.  Notice that svc() enqueues that block without bothering
to see if there are any more threads to dequeue it.  Thats why our dtor can call getq()
without worrying about blocking infinitely:  it knows the message block will be there.
<P>
Also notice that we haven't used <i>THR_DETACHED</i> in this
      tutorial.  Why?  Because in <i>message_queue.cpp</i> we call
      <i>wait()</i> to wait for all of the task's threads to exit.
      That prevents the leak that we normally avoid by using <i>THR_DETACHED</i>.
