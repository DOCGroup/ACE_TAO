ThreadPool example for RT-Notification
======================================

This example has 1 Supplier and 2 Consumers.

The supplier sends an different event to each of the consumers in a
supplier thread continuously.

One of the consumers has 1 second delay in its push method.
let us call it the "slow" consumer and  the other consumer - the "fast" consumer.

If no threadpools are used then the throughput of both consumers is ~1
event per second.

We deploy a threadpool at each proxysupplier.
This causes each consumer to have a seperate data path.

Hence the fast consumer finishes first without any interference from
the slow consumer.

Command Line Options
====================

Supplier:
--------

-Consumers count

-Event_Channel_ThreradPool static_threads

-ProxyConsumer_ThreadPool static_threads

-IORoutput ior_file

-MaxEvents count


Consumer:
--------

-ProxySupplier_ThreadPool static_threads

-MaxEvents count

-Delay seconds

Running the example
===================

Simply run the run_test.pl file.

The run_test.pl file has options that can be modified to run the
example with threadpools deployed at different points.
