	* tao/Transport.h: 
	* tao/Transport.cpp: 
	  - Added a new enum enumerating the different message types
	    recognised within the ORB. 

	  - Added two new methods send_reply_message_i () and
	    send_synch_message_helper_i (). The method
	    send_reply_message_i () seperates the path of the reply
	    message from the send_synchronous_message_i () method. The
	    method send_synch_message_helper_i () is a helper method
	    containing common code for the request and reply paths. 

	  - The methods, send_message (), send_message_shared () and
	    send_message_shared_i () had a variable named
	    is_synchronous. The variable name has been changed to reflect
	    the right usage.

	* tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/UIOP_Transport.cpp: The variable names
	  is_synchronous was changed to reflect the usage.
	
	* tao/Invocation.cpp:
	* tao/Invocation.h: Instead of calling invoke () with a magic
	  number, used the enumeration defined in Transport.h.
