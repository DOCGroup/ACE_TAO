	* tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp:
	* tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.cpp: Removed code that reset stuff
	  from the destructor.  This caused problems when trying to use
	  the ACE_DES_FREE macro since it called the destructor first and
	  then free ().

	* tao/TAO_Server_Request.cpp: All calls to send_message () will
	  carry an argument mentioning that they are replies.

	* tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp: Fixed a problem in dump_msg ()
	  method. The probelm was that we neved respected the byte-order
	  of the sending ORB when printing out request id's. Thanks to Kew
	  Whitney <Whitney.Kew@Invensys.com>

	* tao/Transport.cpp: Cosmetic fixes.

	* tao/Queued_Message.h:
	* tao/Queued_Message.cpp: Added an argument in the constructor to
	  pass an allocator. Added a pure virtual method, clone () to the
	  interface.

	* tao/Synch_Queued_Message.h:
	* tao/Synch_Queued_Message.cpp:
	* tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.h:
	* tao/Asynch_Queued_Message.cpp: Implemented the method clone ().

	* tao/Incoming_Mesage_Queue.cpp: Fixed a typo in a print

	* tao/Transport.h:
	* tao/Transport.cpp:
	  - Added a new enum enumerating the different message types
	    recognised within the ORB.

	  - Added two new methods send_reply_message_i () and
	    send_synch_message_helper_i (). The method
	    send_reply_message_i () seperates the path of the reply
	    message from the send_synchronous_message_i () method. The
	    method send_synch_message_helper_i () is a helper method
	    containing common code for the request and reply paths.

	  - The methods, send_message (), send_message_shared () and
	    send_message_shared_i () had a variable named
	    is_synchronous. The variable name has been changed to reflect
	    the right usage.

	* tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/DIOP_Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/SHMIOP_Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Strategies/UIOP_Transport.cpp: The variable names
	  is_synchronous was changed to reflect the usage.

	* tao/Invocation.cpp:
	* tao/Invocation.h: Instead of calling invoke () with a magic
	  number, used the enumeration defined in Transport.h.
