          This entry deals with the refactoring work on the ACE wide char
          support. The forces that drove the design are as follows:

          - Provide ACE a singular wchar_t type that can be used in
          conjunction with system services.
          - Allow CDR to use its own wchar type that can deviate from
          wchar_t.
          - Keep ACE interfaces consistent and backwards compatible.
          - Provide optimized conversion functions for all known use
          cases.

          ACE now uses wchar_t on all its wide-char interfaces. The type
          wchar_t could be defined by a platform's compiler, system headers,
          or the appropriate ACE platform configuration file. The extraneous
          wchar types ACE_WCHAR_T, ACE_WCHAR_TYPE, and ACE_OS::WChar have
          been removed. ACE_HAS_WCHAR is deprecated. A wchar_t type will
          always be defined.

          Since a wchar_t type is always defined we then always expose
          ACE's public wchar interfaces regardless of private
          implementation. If ACE_LACKS_XXXX defined for a function then
          either emulate or return <not supported>. This greatly cleans up the
          headers and eliminates the dependency on the symbol ACE_HAS_WCHAR.

          A pattern has been created for the few methods of ACE that CDR
          requires. The pattern allows for the compiler to emulate a
          function with any wchar type, provide a narrow-char specialization,
          a wchar specialization and defaults to the emulator if the wchar
          specialization is not possible (due to ACE_LACKS_XXXX). The pattern
          can easily be applied to other ACE methods and classes.

          The design and intent of ACE_USES_WCHAR has not been
          changed. Many cases of inconsistent use has been fixed. The
          fixes included simply changing types of local variables,
          expanding an interface to override on char and wchar_t, and
          forcing certain classes/functions to be templated and NOT based
          on ACE_TCHAR.

          Apply the new conversion macros.
          Remove ACE_HAS_WCHAR usage. wchar_t will always get defined.
          Using template ACE_Get_Arg_Opt to properly handle argv input.
          Replaced main() with ACE_TMAIN().
          Using ACE_Argv_Type_Converter to convert argv to match API declarations.


        * ace/ARGV.h:
        * ace/ARGV.inl:
        * ace/ARGV.cpp:

          Convert class ACE_ARGV into template ACE_TARGV

        * ace/Argv_Type_Converter.h:
        * ace/Argv_Type_Converter.inl:
        * ace/Argv_Type_Converter.cpp:

          Use ACE::String_Conversion templates to manage local memory
          allocation/deallocation. Use the same for type conversions. Get
          rid of macro ACE_USES_WCHAR usage.


        * ace/Basic_Stats.h:
        * ace/Basic_Stats.cpp:

          Add wide variant of method ACE_Basic_Stats::dump_results()


        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Check for ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR & ACE_WCHAR_MAX to be predefined. This
          frees us from making assumptions on the underlying wchar_t type.


        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          The requirement for CDR customized wchar type is now isolated to
          CDR. ACE_CDR_WCHAR_OVERRIDE is used to force CDR to deviate from
          wchar_t. No other services in ACE deviates from wchar_t.


        * ace/Get_Opt.h:
        * ace/Get_Opt.inl:
        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:

          Convert class ACE_Get_Opt into template ACE_Get_Arg_Opt


        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_ctype_T.inl:

          Templated most of the functions. Add new file to hold the inlined
          template definitions.


        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl:

          Use ACE::String_Conversion templates to handle the wide char
          conversions across platforms.

        * ace/OS_NS_string_base.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_string_base.cpp:

          Extracted a number of methods from OS_NS_stdlib to maintain
          backwards compatibility and have the string conversion classes
          reuse exising functions (not reimplement). The string conversion
          classes have to be declared in the configuration layer for
          backwards compatibility. Users will not have to change/add #include
          to access the conversion services.


        * ace/OS_NS_string.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_string.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp:

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:

        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.cpp:

          Changed APIs to use type wchar_t instead of WChar. There was no
          reason for using another defined type when wchar_t could be used directly.


        * ace/Stats.h:
        * ace/Stats.cpp:

          Define/implement wide variant of dump_results() & dump_throughput()


        * ace/String_Conversion_T.h:
        * ace/String_Conversion_T.inl:
        * ace/String_Conversion_T.cpp:

          The new string conversion namespace includes a set of functions
          and stack based classes to aid where ACE/TAO has to translate
          between char and wchar_t. See the ACE test wchar_conversion for
          usage.


        * ace/ace_wchar.h:
        * ace/ace_wchar.inl:

          Configuration level files which include wchar support files or
          construct the various wchar types.


        * ace/ace_wchar_win32_defs.h:

          Support for Windows specific API's. These were mostly if not all
          ripped out from ace_wchar.h. ace_wchar.h includes the file.


        * ace/config-all.h:
        * ace/config-borland-common.h:

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:
        * ace/config-win32-visualage.h:

          Added new wchar configurations. The ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR and
          ACE_WCHAR_MAX need to be defined in the configuration files.


        * apps/gperf/tests/tests.mpc:

          Avoid gperf build when doing a ACE_USES_WCHAR build.

        * tests/WChar_Conversion.cpp:

          wchar conversion test.


        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Add the wchar conversion test.

Sun May  7 21:03:30 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,cpp}:

          Weeding out the remaining issues with single threaded
          builds. The implementation now relies on the ACE_TSS_* macros to
          abstract from the differences among build styles and platform
          support for TSS.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.{h,cpp}:

          Eliminated commented out code. Minor reformatting in places.

        * ace/TSS_T.{h,inl,cpp}:

          Added some comments to help others avoid a few pitfalls. Made
          ts_init() a non-const, which eliminates a few const_cast's.

Sun May  7 07:02:51 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Refactored the TSS usage (again) to fix a nasty
          order-of-initialization problem. The gist of which is that, if
          the ptr (to a template class instance) is a static member, in
          static builds, it will be initialized by the process prologue
          code *after* another static initializer has had the chance to
          use and assign it a value. The solution was to use a method
          scope static instance, which C++ guarantees to be initialized by
          the (first) exit from that method.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Refactored the construction to avoid using straight new in
          constructor initializer lists. Replaced new with ACE_NEW_* where
          appropriate.

Sat May  6 18:08:13 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Add feature tests for ACE_LACKS_ASCTIME, ACE_LACKS_ACSTIME_R,
          ACE_LACKS_GETCWD, ACE_LACKS_GMTIME, ACE_LACKS_GMTIME_R,
          ACE_LACKS_LOCALTIME, and ACE_LACKS_STRFTIME.

Sat May  6 09:52:06 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * examples/DLL/test_dll.cpp: Renamed the DLLs and removed the "./"
          from the pathname.  Thanks to Sam and Roopa for reporting this
          and tracking it down, respectively.

Sat May  6 10:23:13 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Add -lrt -laio to
          the LIBS. The Proactor framework needs this; I'm not sure why it
          never showed up until static builds were run.

Tue Apr 25 10:22:16 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp (strerror): Do a sanity check to make sure
          errnum >= 0 and < _sys_nerr and set errno to EINVAL if things
          are not sane.  Thanks to Aleksandar Vukajlovic <vukajlo at
          finsoft dot co dot yu> for this fix.

Fri May  5 19:37:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Default_Constants.h:
          Added a compile time check that ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_BUFSIZE must be
          defined to a value bigger then 0, it is 0 we get in a never ending
          loop in the CDR code

Fri May  5 17:01:32 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/client/local_spipe_client_test.cpp:

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_L_SPIPE.{cpp i h}:
          Wide-char corrections.

Fri May  5 13:11:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/FIFO.cpp:

          Removed psos support

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stddef.h:
          Moved setting of ACE_LACKS_STDDEF_H and ACE_LACKS_PTRDIFF_T to the
          WinCE file

Fri May  5 13:08:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Changed the way templates are handled

        * ace/Malloc_Allocator.h:
          Doxygen improvement

Thu May  4 22:11:06 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

          Thanks to Gary Fernandez <gary dot fernandez at ironmountain dot
          com> for this change.

Thu May  4 21:07:10 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SPIPE_Acceptor.cpp (create_new_instance, close): Have to use

          ACE_HAS_STREAM_PIPES. Thanks to Gary Fernandez <gary dot
          fernandez at ironmountain dot com> for this fix.

        * THANKS: Added Gary Fernandez to the Hall of Fame.

Thu May  4 08:50:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Reverted the change below, broke the sendfile test and Steve
        Huston changed things in such a way that sendfile is only
        used on Solaris 9 and newer

        Tue May  2 09:34:54 Pacific Daylight Time 2006    <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_sendfile.inl (sendfile):
          Removed "::" global scope qualifier from platform sendfile()
          call.  It caused problem on Solaris 8.  Thanks to Simon Massey
          and Johnny Willemsen for analyzing the problem and suggesting
          this fix.

Thu May  4 08:36:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:

Thu May  4 00:43:32 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Add Dynamic_Service_Dependency.{cpp,h} to appropriate lists.

Wed May  3 16:02:10 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fixed a problem due to an attempt to access current_ before it
          has been initialized (a static ACE_TSS instance). The current_
          is now just a pointer to an ACE_TSS instance, which gets
          dynamicaly allocated upon invoking the current() method. The
          deallocation of that instance is left up to the Object Manager
          with which the dynamic ACE_TSS instance is registered.

        * ace/TSS_T.h:

          Added a ACE_TSS_SET () to complete the set of TSS access
          operations, which should work regardless of threading, TSS
          emulation and TSS availability.

Wed May  3 11:52:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Mem_Map.inl:

          Moved the ACE_BEGIN_VERSIONED_NAMESPACE_DECL macro to include
          ace_yyparse.

Tue May  2 09:34:54 Pacific Daylight Time 2006    <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_sendfile.inl (sendfile):

          Removed "::" global scope qualifier from platform sendfile()
          call.  It caused problem on Solaris 8.  Thanks to Simon Massey
          and Johnny Willemsen for analyzing the problem and suggesting
          this fix.

Tue May  2 10:34:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_GETCWD, ACE_LACKS_ASCTIME, ACE_LACKS_ASCTIME_R,
          ACE_LACKS_GMTIME, ACE_LACKS_GMTIME_R, ACE_LACKS_LOCALTIME and
          ACE_LACKS_STRFTIME. These macros are new and will be used soon
          in the ACE_OS layer.

Mon May  1 19:49:45 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ARGV.{h i cpp}: Filled out more of the documentation in this
          class, specifically mentioning that the class will enforce the
          "whitespace separates tokens, except when quoted" rule of command
          line parsing that's consistent with ACE_Get_Opt, etc. Also removed
          documentation of non-existant restrictions such as after using
          add(), can't use buf().
          Removed the State enum since the only value ever used was ITERATIVE,
          and changed "int state_" to "bool iterative_" (and removed the
          state() accessor). Changed substitute_env_args_ from int to bool.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.{h cpp} (argv_to_string, string_to_argv): Changed
          the substitute_env_args parameter from "int" to "bool" to better
          reflect what it is, a yes/no indicator.

          What I meant to commit last time.

Sun Apr 30 02:21:16 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
          Eliminating more warnings from the scoreboard. I'm not sure the
          best way to add this patch to ace/svcconf.mpb, since it affects
          more than just gnuace targets. The easiest would be to store the
          diff between this commit and the previous version and run patch,
          but I'm not sure how to integrate that solution.

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.9.h: Moved ACE_HAS_SENDFILE from Solaris 8 to
          Solaris 9. Solaris 8 supports sendfilev[64] but not sendfile,
          at least not without some patches I don't know about.

          rest of the parser seems to be designed so that multiple parses
          can coexist without name clashes.

          Correcting a build problem, caused by the extraneous semicolons

Wed Apr 26 20:21:49 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          The motivation for these changes was to enable support in ACE
          for multiple instances of Service Configuration Repository, or
          more appropriately - "Gestalt" (from the German word, meaning
          something that's more than the sum of its parts).  This is
          feature is necessary to enable support for ORB-specific, or more
          generally - service-specific sets of services, i.e. to be able
          to have dynamically loaded services to use their own private set
          of service objects. In the context of the implementation I will
          use "gestalt" as a synonym for service configuration context or
          service configuration repository.

          In order to accomplish this, the "instance"-related
          functionality of the former ACE_Service_Config class has been
          moved to another class - ACE_Service_Gestalt. The
          ACE_Service_Config retains all static interfaces and those
          members, pertaining to the concept of process-wide configuration
          state. The service config, as known today has been retained as a
          concept, but in its specialized semantics as holding a
          process-wide configuration state. The primary concept expressing
          an instance of configuration context is the gestalt. The
          implementation actually uses a specialization of
          ACE_Service_Gestalt in order to implement ACE_Service_Config as
          a singleton, special case of configuration context.

          The static methods in ACE_Service_Config provide access to
          process-wide gestalt (ubergestalt, anyone?) instance.

          For more details, here is the history of all included changes,
          with their motivation and explanation. It is ordered
          alphabetically, by the names of the changed files:

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added to the condition evaluating ACE::debug() to include a
          check if environmental variable ACE_DEBUG has been set.

          Updated the debug() function to call getenv() only once by using
          a method-local static variable to hold the value from the
          environment.

        * ace/DLL.h:
        * ace/DLL.cpp:

          Implemented an operator=, needed in order to implement the
          ACE_Service_Configuration_Guard class.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:

          Improved the error diagnostics so that a "file not found" would
          not mask a "symbol not defined" error when loading a DLL.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.h:

          "Privatized" copy ctor and operator= for ACE_Dynamic_Service
          objects since it is not designed for such operations.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.inl:

          Added overloaded method instance() for ACE_ANTI_TCHAR.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.cpp:

          Changes to enable instantiation of a service, based on the
          registration in a particular service repository. Adding a method
          that takes ACE_Service_Gestalt* additional parameter.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.h:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:

          Factored out a find_i() method to be used by the friend
          ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency class. It implements the specific
          lookup policy that extends the search to the global repository
          if the named service object can not be found locally.

          Added instance method, allowing the caller to explicitly specify
          the gestalt.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.h:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.inl:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.cpp:

          A newly introduced class, whose instances are designed to be
          embedded inside instances of other classes, typically created by
          DLL-based factories (service objects). This provides a way to
          declare dependency on a specific service, thus avoiding order of
          initialization issues with objects whose implementation code
          resides in dynamically loaded services.

          It is disastrous to have dynamically loadable services create
          and give away ownership of objects and then be unloaded before
          all those instances have been deleted. Normally the code for
          such objects classes resides within the TEXT segment of the DLL,
          which implements the service. If a service gets removed, its DLL
          may be unmapped from memory and then any attempt to invoke a
          method on the said objects will cause SEGV.

          Such instances must contain a member of
          ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency initialized with the service they
          depend on. @code ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency's constructor
          and destructor are "magical" - they work by maintaining the
          underlying dynamic service's DLL reference count.

          The problem was not present before because the one Service
          Repository outlived any other user objects. Now that an
          un-loadable service can own its configuration, the sequence of
          service finalization has been reversed.

          Updated the implementation of ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency
          class to ease debugging. ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency gets
          initialized whenever a dependent service gets loaded, to help us
          keep our access to dependent instances after their DLL is gone
          (by upping the ref count on the DLL).

          Updated usage of gestalt's instance() to current(). Removed
          unnecessary comments.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:

          Changed the ACE_STATIC_SVC_DEFINE to use the new
          ACE_Service_Config::insert () method, which allows to streamline
          the Service Configuration interface and promote hiding the
          storage used for the static service descriptors.

        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:

          Changes to aid in keeping track of the gestalt, while deep in
          the guts of the svc.conf parser.

          Replaced the ACE_Service_Gestalt & in the method signatures with
          ACE_Service_Gestalt * to unify the interfaces.

          Updated the static function node's logic to use only
          ACE_Service_Gestalt public members and to no longer rely on
          knowledge about the internal storage representation of service
          repository.

          Removed a static_cast<> in ACE_Static_Function_Node::symbol()
          that was causing problems on some platforms. It was not even
          necessary as both sides were of the same type.

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,inl,cpp}:

          This separates the responsibilities between the service gestalt,
          which represents an _instance_ of configuration information, and
          the service config, which represents a special, process-wide,
          global configuration repository. Since both these entities
          represent the same concept - service configuration state, but
          from different aspects, the ACE_Service_Config now inherits
          (publicly) from ACE_Service_Gestalt.

          Lots of instance-related code moved to ACE_Service_Gestalt
          Replaced the use of char with ACE_ANTI_TCHAR and the appropriate
          ACE_TEXT_* macros.

          Moved the parsing of command-line options, pertaining to the
          process as a whole, here - in the parse_args_i () (protected,
          virtual).

          In order to resolve a problem caused by the inability of a
          dependent static service to determine which gestalt they need to
          register with, the concept of "current" was separated from the
          "global" gestalt. The current gestalt is pointed to by a
          pointer, stored in thread-specific storage (TSS) and manipulated
          by the ACE_Service_Config_Guard class that implements the
          "resource acquisition is initialization" idiom.

          Fixed an error in the separation of responsibilities between the
          instance gestalt and the global (ubergestalt), during
          initialization.  The bug can cause infinite recursion, when
          initializing an ORB, housed in a dynamic service. The singleton
          gestalt (i.e. ACE_Service_Config) must be initialized through
          open_i(), before open_i() can proceed initializing the specific
          gestalt instance. The difficulty is in that some use cases
          reverse the order of initialization by calling
          ACE_Service_Config::open () first and then, at some point call
          the instance gestalt open_i(). The solution is to use the
          is_initialized_ member together with an explicit call to
          ACE_Service_Config::global()->open_i().  To ease debugging of
          the process of registering static service, I have changes the
          ACE_Service_Config::static_svcs() to return
          ACE_Service_Gestalt::instance (), instead. Thus all the
          ACE_STATIC_SVC* macros are still working (no need to change
          existing code), but now there is a convenient place to debug -
          see the newly added ACE_Service_Gestalt::insert () method.  The
          header file no longer declares ACE_STATIC_SVCS,
          ACE_STATIC_SVCS_ITERATOR, ACE_SVC_QUEUE and
          ACE_SVC_QUEUE_ITERATOR. Those are now protected typedefs in
          ACE_Service_Gestalt, where they are actually used.

          Added new insert () method to use instead of the sequence
          static_svc ()->insert () which unnecessary exposes the internal
          storage structure of Service Configurator.  Made no_static_svcs_
          an instance member, instead of a class (static) member, thus
          providing for ability to set it per instance, not globally.

          Added default values for open_i() and declared private copy ctor
          and assignment operator for ACE_Service_Config_Guard, since it
          is not intended to be copied.

          Similarly, moved the parts of the open_i() functionality that
          did not belong in every instance of the gestalt.
          ACE_Service_Config is again a process-wide Singleton,registered
          with ACE_Object_Manager.

          Eliminated old #if 0-ed code in Service_Config.cpp.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.inl:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Encapsulates the idea of Service Configuration repository, or
          configuration context.

          Changed open_i to be able to detect if it is working on the
          special, process-wide instance (ubergestalt) or a "plain"
          gestalt instance, since there are things that must only be done
          once per process - like signal handler, logging key and
          daemon-ization of the whole process.

          Added an ignore_static_svcs parameter to
          ACE_Service_Gestalt::open_i in order to preserve the prior
          behavior of the singleton ACE_Service_Gestalt instance. Even
          though its no_static_svcs_ member was being initialized with 1,
          some clients (TAO) needs to be able to override it. Since now a
          call to open_i on an instance gestalt may precede in time the
          call to open_i on the ubergestalt, we need a mechanism to allow
          the no_static_svcs_ value to be overridden.

          Added the insert()'s implementation (described above).  Added a
          singleton() method to return the process-wide gestalt singleton
          (or ubergestalt?:). Used in open_i() to account for the fact
          that now a Service Gestalt may be called to open () prior to
          open () on the singleton instance, which would typically contain
          the bulk of the static service object descriptors.

          There was a problem with "hybrid" service objects, i.e. dynamic
          SO which contains static SO (dependent services).  The dependent
          services are typically registered via static ctor or static
          initializer at the point of loading of the dynamic SO's DLL.  As
          such, they end up registering before the dynamic SO.  Upon
          finalization of the service repository, the dynamic SO is
          finalized first, thus unloading its DLL and unmapping the TEXT
          segment, where the dependent static services code is.  When
          next, the static SO is to be finalized its memory is no longer
          at valid address.  The change ensures the dynamic service is
          registered *before* its dependent static services and will
          therefore be finalized last.  The solution is based upon the
          concept of forward declaring a dynamic service, named after the
          configuration file being processed.  Before processing a file,
          we simply check for an existing service with the same name and
          "pass" if we find one.

          Fixed the ACE_Service_Config_Guard's detection of the case where
          the forward service declaration was not replaced by a proper
          declaration as expected. It now properly removes the forward
          decl, not the "good" instance.

          Cleared up the TSS management issue, causing executable to crash
          on startup. The problem was due to an order-of-instantiation
          issue, involving the TSS-based pointer to the current
          gestalt. Used ACE_Object_Manager's shutting_down and starting_up
          methods to determine if it is safe to use the static ACE_TSS
          instance.

          Added const-ness for find().  Removed prototypes for initialize,
          resume, suspend and remove that used plain char type and
          conditionally compiled in only for WinCE and
          ACE_USES_WCHAR. Service_Config still declares and defines these
          (using ACE_ANTI_TCHAR). Updated to resolve problems when built
          with ACE_USES_WCHAR.

          Declared private copy ctor and assignment operator for
          ACE_Service_Gestalt and ACE_Service_Type_Factory, since their
          instances are not intended to be copied.  Added an
          ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC macro for the copy-ctor and assignment
          operator of ACE_Service_Type_Factory.

          Reorganized to streamline the header file and remove unnecessary
          declarations and to add a decl for find_static_svc_descriptor().

          Changed the open() method's implementation to incorporate the
          additional parameter for open_i().

          Added the new find_static_svc_descriptor() member, which allows
          ACE_Static_Function_Node to not need to know how the static
          services are registered in the service repository.

        * ace/Service_Object.h:
        * ace/Service_Object.inl:
        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:

          Exposed the dll_ member through dll () const method because the
          reference is needed by the new ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency
          class. Fixed the dump () method.

        * ace/Service_Repository.h:
        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:

          Added const-ness for the find* () methods. Added debugging.  The
          remove method changes the order of services registrations in the
          repository, which may break the Service Repository's invariant,
          imposed by the need to correctly finalize dynamic services with
          their own static services.

          For example, consider a case where a static service (S0) is
          registered in the repository. Then a DLL-based service (D1)
          registers its own static service (S1). So far the order is
          "finalization-compatible": S0 < D1 < S1, i.e. services will be
          finalized in reverse order and D1's DLL will still be available
          when finalizing S1.  Now let's remove (S0). Currently, after
          this operation the repository end up in this order: S1 < D1,
          which is trivially not finalization-compatible.

          Instead of replacing the pointer with the last ptr to a svc in
          the array (repository) and then decrementing the current size of
          the repo, the solution actually shifts left the rest of the
          array.

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:
        * ace/Shared_Object.cpp:

          Removed some and updated existing debug statements. Eliminated
          dead partial instantiation code.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Changed to allow propagation of the knowledge about which
          gestalt is currently being used for service registrations.

          Factored the ACE_Svc_Conf_Param class out in its own translation
          unit.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Param.h:

          Replaced the ACE_Service_Gestalt & in the method signatures with
          ACE_Service_Gestalt *

        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Updated the svcconf.mpb rule to allow building with Bison 2.0
          and up. The change adds #ifdef/#endif around the generated
          header file. A YYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED define is added in order to
          make sure the token declarations from the Svc_Conf_Tokens.h are
          used instead of those generated in the Svc_Conf_y.cpp file.

          Added the new Dynamic_Service_Dependency.* files.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Adding the new tests to the automated test suite to run during

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.rc:
          Removed msvc specific lines

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          The ACE_Init_Test should use its resource file. Fixes bugzilla
          2495

        * ace/Capabilities.{h,cpp}:
          Prefix increment instead of postfix

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.{h,cpp}:
          Removed workaround for suncc 4.2

        * ace/Object_Manager.h:
        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.h:
        * ace/Thread_Mutex.h:
          Doxygen improvements

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
          Use prefix increment, initialise pointers with 0 and don't print
          an error message when we can't a dll, this gives false messages
          when using TAO. This fixes bugzilla 2383. Thanks to Ming Xiong
          for making a patch.

        * ace/Proactor.h:
          Removed all virtual keywords, not needed for this class. Fixes
          bugzilla 2178.

        * ace/Thread_Manager.h:
          Removed virtual keywords, not needed and safes footprint. Fixes
          bugzilla 2179.

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Added more msvc checks to detect code constructors for vc6 or
          vc7.0

        Merged ACE changes from sendfile branch. Also made a lot of const
        improvements throughout ACE.

        * ace/Mem_Map.cpp (open):

        Only copy the filename to the ACE_Mem_Map::filename_ member
        if the call to open() succeeds.

        * ace/PI_Malloc.h (ACE_Malloc_Header):

        Added missing private and undefined copy constructor.  The
        corresponding assignment operator was already there.

        Wed Mar 29 14:51:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
        Solaris 8 and newer also support sendfile. It seems HPUX also
        supports it but with a different signature and semantics, so just
        don't try it there yet.

        Wed Mar 29 13:06:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
