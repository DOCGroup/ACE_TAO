ACE XML PARSER Framework README file

* Character set

ACE XML only deal with pure unicode encoding.  I.e., ACE XML
does not care about language specific encoding information.

* SAX - The Simple API for XML

ACE XML Parser interfaces follows the the design of SAX 2.0, which is
a public domain specification for Java.  The major difference between
ACE XML Parser interfaces and SAX is that we added an reference of
ACEXML_Env to every SAX method to accomodate platforms/compilers that
don't support C++ exceptions.  SAX is defined by David Megginson
