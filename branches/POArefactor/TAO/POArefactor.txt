        * tao/PortableServer/*.{h,cpp}:
          Moved everything from TAO::PortableServer to TAO::Portable_Server to
          prevent any accidents that a wrong namespace is taken

Fri Sep 24 14:27:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/*.{h,cpp}:
          Moved all new Policy Value classes to the TAO::PortableServer
          namespace. Renamed everything to match filenames. Everything

        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp:
          Improved loading of thread policy, same code as in the POA and the
          Policy factory, I like to factor this out to prevent code
          duplication.

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}:
          Zapped all code that was guarded with #ifdef 0, it is old, and
          makes it a little bit more readable

Fri Sep 17 14:07:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/POA_Thread_Policy.{h,cpp}:
          Let the constructor do nothing, make an init method to intialize the
          object, the init method with an Any can throw an exception and that
          is something we don't want to do in a constructor

        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServer_PolicyFactory.cpp:
          Don't get the ThreadPolicyValue out of the Any here, just pass it to
          the Loadable_Thread_Policy and get it out of the Any in the
          POA_ThreadPolicy.

        * tao/PortableServer/Loadable_Thread_Policy.{h,cpp}:
          Added create method with an Any, this can throw exceptions

        * tao/PortableServer/Key_Adapters.cpp:
          Replaced all ACE cast macros with C++ versions

        * tao/PortableServer/Key_Adapters.h:
          Instead of including PortableServerC.h, just include PS_ForwardC.h,
          this is enough

        * tao/PortableServer/Loadable_Thread_Policy.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/Thread_Policy_Value.h:
          Don't export svc config stuff

        * tao/PortableServer/POA.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/Object_Adapter.cpp:

          Added new *C.h files, without this existing apps don't build

        * tao/PortableServer.cpp:
          Added svc conf directives to process the new classes

        * tao/POA_Thread_Policy.{h,cpp}:
          Added missing policy_type method

          I created the branch it seems CosNaming didn't build, so I can't
          test this right now, have to move my branch forward one time.

        * tao/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/PortableGroup/POA_Hooks.{cpp,h}:
          Removed, functionality is now in TAO_GOA

Tue Sep 14 12:17:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/ORT_Adapter_Factory.h:
        * tao/ObjRefTemplate/ORT_Adapter_Factory_Impl.{h,cpp}:
          Removed exception spec from create/destroy method, for the destroy
          it is not needed, for the create, we could just return 0 in case of
          out of memory

Tue Sep 14 11:26:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/POA_ThreadPolicy.h:

          PortableServer library

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp,i}:
          Zapped all functionality related to PortableGroup hooks, we don't
          need this anymore.

Tue Sep 14 08:06:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/GOA*:
          Zapped these files

          Added GOA interface here

        * tao/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/GOA.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Moved the GOA to this place, implementation has to be made correct,
          POA hook is not needed anymore, must be loadable by service
          configurator. By moving this now I can cleanup some more stuff in
          the ORB.

Mon Sep 13 12:11:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/orb.idl:
        * tao/orb_types.pidl:
          Moved the typedefs from orb.idl to orb_types.pidl. This makes it
          possiblet to just get the types without all other stuff that is
          included in orb.idl

        * tao/orb_typesC.{h,cpp,inl}:

          No need to include orb.idl, only need orb_types.pidl

        * tao/PortableServer/*Policy.pidl:
          Because PortableServer.pidl doesn't include orb_types.pidl, we don't
          get Policy.pidl for free anymore, we have to explicit include it
          here

          Removed tao_poa_downcast, use dynamic cast
          Also inherit from GOA, this will be moved soon.

        * tao/PortableGroup_Hooks.h:
          Temporarily removed checks for minimum poa, this has to move
          together with the GOA to the PortableGroup library.

          Also used the minimum corba 1.0 spec to remove the parts we don't
          use with minimum corba.
