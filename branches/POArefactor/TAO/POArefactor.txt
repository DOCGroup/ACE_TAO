          makes it a little bit more readable

Fri Sep 17 14:07:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/POA_Thread_Policy.{h,cpp}:
          Let the constructor do nothing, make an init method to intialize the
          object, the init method with an Any can throw an exception and that
          is something we don't want to do in a constructor

        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServer_PolicyFactory.cpp:
          Don't get the ThreadPolicyValue out of the Any here, just pass it to
          the Loadable_Thread_Policy and get it out of the Any in the
          POA_ThreadPolicy.

        * tao/PortableServer/Loadable_Thread_Policy.{h,cpp}:
          Added create method with an Any, this can throw exceptions

        * tao/PortableServer/Key_Adapters.h:
          Instead of including PortableServerC.h, just include PS_ForwardC.h,

          I created the branch it seems CosNaming didn't build, so I can't
          test this right now, have to move my branch forward one time.

          Removed exception spec from create/destroy method, for the destroy

          Moved the GOA to this place, implementation has to be made correct,
          POA hook is not needed anymore, must be loadable by service
          configurator. By moving this now I can cleanup some more stuff in
          the ORB.

        * tao/orb.idl:
        * tao/orb_types.pidl:
          Moved the typedefs from orb.idl to orb_types.pidl. This makes it

        * tao/PortableServer/*Policy.pidl:
          Because PortableServer.pidl doesn't include orb_types.pidl, we don't
          get Policy.pidl for free anymore, we have to explicit include it
          here

          Removed tao_poa_downcast, use dynamic cast
          Also inherit from GOA, this will be moved soon.

        * tao/PortableGroup_Hooks.h:
          Temporarily removed checks for minimum poa, this has to move
          together with the GOA to the PortableGroup library.

          Also used the minimum corba 1.0 spec to remove the parts we don't
          use with minimum corba.
