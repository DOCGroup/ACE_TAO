        * tao/orb.idl:
        * tao/orb_types.pidl:
          Moved ValueModifier and Visibility to orb.idl again, not really
          needed and causes problems with valuetype library

        * tao/orb_typesC.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * tao/orb_typesA.cpp:
          Regenerated

        * tao/OBV_Constants.h:

        * tao/orb.idl:
        * tao/orb_types.pidl:
          Moved the typedefs from orb.idl to orb_types.pidl. This makes it
          possiblet to just get the types without all other stuff that is
          included in orb.idl

        * tao/orb_typesC.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * tao/orb_typesA.cpp:
          New generated files

        * tao/OBV_Constants:
          Removed typedefs, include orb_typesC.h instead

        * tao/ORB.h:
          Removed typedefs that are now in orb_types. Also removed
          valuetype_factory_map_ members which was ifdefed out

        * tao/Typecode_Constants.cpp:
          Removed orb_id, this is now in orb_typesA.cpp

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Added include of orb_typesC.h

        * tao/PortableServer/PortableServer.pidl:
        * tao/PortableServer/ServantLocator.pidl:
          No need to include orb.idl, only need orb_types.pidl

        * tao/PortableServer/*Policy.pidl:
          Because PortableServer.pidl doesn't include orb_types.pidl, we don't
          get Policy.pidl for free anymore, we have to explicit include it
          here

        * tao/PortableServer/*C.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * tao/PortableServer/*A.cpp:
        * tao/PortableServer/diffs/*:

          Serveral new diffs

        * tao/PortableServer/*C.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Several new generated files

        * tao/PortableServer/POA.{h,cpp}:
          Removed tao_poa_downcast, use dynamic cast
          Also inherit from GOA, this will be moved soon.

        * tao/PortableGroup_Hooks.h:
          Temporarily removed checks for minimum poa, this has to move
          together with the GOA to the PortableGroup library.

          Also used the minimum corba 1.0 spec to remove the parts we don't
          use with minimum corba.
