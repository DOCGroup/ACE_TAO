@page EndpointPolicy Test README File

  This test validates the TAO-specific Endpoint Policy. The Endpoint Policy
  is applied to a POAManager via the POAManagerFactory, it is not applied to
  individual POAs. Any POA associated with an endpoint constrained POAManager
  is subject to the same constraint.

  The server in this test takes one or more localhost-based -ORBEndpoint
  arguments. A second argument supplies the "correct" port number to be used
  to create an Endpoint Policy value. Internally, the server creates an
  invalid endpoint using the hostname_in_ior option for -ORBEndpoint.

  Two Endpoint Policy instances are created, one using localhost and the
  supplied port number, and another creating an invalid endpoint. These are
  then supplied to the separate POAManagers which are then used to create
  new POAs. Object references are created on each of the root, good, and bad
  POAs.

  The client is then passed an IOR and a flag indicating this is expected to
  succeed or fail. The test succeeds if the client can use the good IOR and
  gets an exception using the bad IOR.

  To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  or start the client and the server manually:

$ server -p $port -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost:$port
$ client -k file://$iorfile [-b]

  $iorfile is either "good.ior" or "bad.ior" and -b makes the client expect
  to fail using the supplied IOR.
