This program tests fundamentals of TAO's ORB fault tolerance by
merging multiple profiles in a single object reference.

Run the application as follows.

$ server -o (file_name1) -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost:10007
$ server -o (file_name2) -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost:10008
$ client -k file://file_name1 -m file://file_name2
(When a message "Kill primray " appears on screen, kill the server
exhibiting the IOR in file with name "file_name1". )

Test purpose:

This is a test to see whether we generate exceptions as per the
spec. When we loose connection with a connected server, the ORB would
throw a COMM_FAILURE exception. This is platform dependent.  One
wouldn't see this on NT. The reason for this is the way TCP has been
been implemented on NT & Solaris. I am not going in to the details for
this behaviour. TRANSIENT exceptions are thrown when the ORB has
tried all the object references it has and is not able to establish
connection with any of them (TRANSIENT exceptions are also thrown for
few other cases, but here the test is for the case that has been
mentioned above).

Comments:
========

- The run exhibits different behaviours on SUN and NT
