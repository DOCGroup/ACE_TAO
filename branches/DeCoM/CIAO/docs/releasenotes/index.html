<h2>Current Status</h2><a name="status">
<ol>
<li>The first cut of the new <a
  href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2003-07-02"> DnC </a>
  specification implementation, which we call DAnCE is available in
  this distribution. DAnCE is housed under <CODE> $CIAO_ROOT
  </CODE>. We plan to enhance DAnCE in the next few months. We believe
  DAnCE will replace existing tool sets in <CODE>
  $CIAO_ROOT/tools</CODE>. There are a few features in
  <CODE>$CIAO_ROOT/tools</CODE> that are missing in the DAnCE
  implementation. Please see <a href="../TODO.html"> TODO </a> file
  for more details. We plan to implement them soon and use DAnCE
  continuously.

 <li> The first cut of DAnCE includes two parts:
  <ul>
  <li>
  A modeling tool chain , <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CoSMIC/">
  CoSMIC</a>, which is capable of describing the Assembly/Component
  using <a
  href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/default.html">
  GME</a> as the development bed. The artifacts generated from the
 CoSMIC are a set of XML descriptors.

  <!-- Tao, I realy don't understand what this means - Bala -->
  <li>This run-time infrastructure that performs the actual deployment
  and  configuration, with a superset of the capabilities described in
  OMG DnC specification with CIAO extension.  </a>.<p><p>

  </ul>
  <!-- Tao, can you please see whether this is needed -->
  In the new DnC run-time framework we have migrated all the
  functionalities present in the old CIAO runtime except the
  Real-Time configuration and Static Configuration, which are
  developed by Washington University in St. Louis. Currently,
  the two CIAO runtime co-exist in our source and the component
  implementation could be used with both framework without much
  change. (For the change that one has to go through please
  read <a href="./switch.html">this</a>.)<p>



  <li> The CIDL Compiler has been eliminated, all CIAO code is now
  generated by the IDL compiler.<p>

 <li> CIAO doesn't yet support features that help integrating CORBA
 components with Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).<p>

 <li> To further interoperability with non-component-aware clients, there
 are files in the $CIAO_ROOT/tools/IDL3_to_IDL2 directory that can be
 compiled into an executable called tao_idl3_to_idl2. This executable
 takes an IDL file (on the command line) containing IDL3 declarations
 and outputs an IDL file with the IDL3 declarations converted to
 equivalent IDL2. IDL2 declarations in the input file are unchanged.
 See the README file in that directory for more information.<p>
