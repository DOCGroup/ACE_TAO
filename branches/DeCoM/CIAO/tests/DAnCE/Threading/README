This test is there to experiment with the TAO/CORBA settings.

There are two components, Component1 and Component2.
Component1 invokes a method (invoke_interface_2) on Component2. In that method,
Component2 invokes a method (invoke_interface_1) on Component1. By default this
doesn't deadlock the application since TAO's default wait strategy prefends this.

The wait strategy can be changed in the deployment plan (descriptors/Plan.cdp).
A deadlock occurs when 'rw' is used as strategy.
