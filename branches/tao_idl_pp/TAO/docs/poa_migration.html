<H3>Migrating CORBA Applications from BOA to POA</H3>

Starting with the CORBA 2.2, the Basic Object Adapter (BOA) has been
deprecated in favor of the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/POA.ps.gz">Portable Object
Adapter</A> (POA).  This document explains the changes required to
migrate CORBA applications based on the BOA to use TAO's POA
implementation, which is the only Object Adapter supported by TAO.
For more information on the benefits of the POA please see the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/report-doc.html">Object
Interconnection</A> columns written by <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/">Doug Schmidt</A> and <A

<ul>
<li>Very little has changed.  Thus, many applications require no changes.</li><P>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Server-side Changes">Server-side Changes</a></h4>

<UL>
<li><CODE>POA_init</CODE> is replaced with <CODE>resolve_initial_references("RootPOA")</CODE> followed
by a <CODE>_narrow</CODE> operation.</li><P>

<li>The implementation no longer inherits from the client-side stub.
Instead, they inherit from <CODE>PortableServer::ServantBase</CODE>.
The implications of this are (a) if you want a object reference for
that, you must use the <CODE>_this</CODE> method.</li><P>

<li>Object ID's are assigned by the POA unless you activate the
servant with a specific ID.  <A
HREF="../performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit">IDL_Cubit</A>
has examples on how to do this.</li><P>

<li>Unlike the BOA, the POA explicitly addresses the temporal nature
of servants and declares that a POA can service either transient or
persistent servants (not both).  The root POA's (mandated,
unchangeable) policy is "transient".  The implications of this are
that in order for a client to be able to manufacture an object
reference on its own and use that to access an object, the servant for
that object must be registered with a POA whose policy is
"persistent".  Thus, you must create a child POA with that policy and
register the servant with that POA.  NOTE: when the POA declares
something as "persistent", it is only stating that the key is valid
between different runs of the server; it makes no claims that state or
anything else is persistent.</li><P>

<ul>
	<li> Servants are not automatically activated, hence you must register
	them by calling some of the <CODE>activate_object*</CODE> methods on a POA or
	calling <CODE>_this</CODE> on the servant; with the latest you have no control on
	the ObjectId (which sometimes is good), and the POA must support the
	right policies (the RootPOA does).</li><P>

	<li>Servant constructors use to take a <CODE>const
char*</CODE> parameter to set
	they object id, this is not needed now, in fact in many cases they use
	to pass this argument to the skeleton class: this will fail
now.</li><P> </ul> This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but
should give you a good starting point.  If you find things along the
way that change your applications and I didn't note them, please send
them to me.  Perhaps we can work together on the ultimate migration
document. <P> </UL>

<h4><a name="Reference counting Servants">Reference counting Servants</h4>

The new POA/servant <a
href="ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/orbos/98-07-12.pdf">reference
counting rules</a> of the CORBA 2.3 spec are somewhat tricky. Here are
two main reasons why: <p>

<ul>

<li> If a servant is deleted without deactivating from the POA, the
application will crash because the POA will try to access the still
registered (but now non-existent) servant when the POA is destroyed. <p>

The solution to this is to make sure that the servant is deleted after
the POA is deleted or make sure that the servant is deactivated from
the POA before the servant is deleted. </li> <p>

<li> You cannot delete a servant which is the target of the current
upcall/request.  A good example of this is the typical destroy()
method, usually written like this:

<PRE>

class TAO_Export TAO_Thread_Policy : public POA_PortableServer::ThreadPolicy
{
  void destroy (CORBA_Environment &ACE_TRY_ENV);
};

void
TAO_Thread_Policy::destroy (CORBA::Environment &ACE_TRY_ENV)
{
  PortableServer::POA_var poa = this->_default_POA (ACE_TRY_ENV);
  ACE_CHECK;

  PortableServer::ObjectId_var id = poa->servant_to_id (this,
                                                        ACE_TRY_ENV);
  ACE_CHECK;

  poa->deactivate_object (id.in (),
                          ACE_TRY_ENV);
  ACE_CHECK;

  // Commit suicide: must have been dynamically allocated.
  delete this;
}

</PRE>

The correct implementation is:

<PRE>

class TAO_Export TAO_Thread_Policy : public virtual PortableServer::RefCountServantBase,
                                     public virtual POA_PortableServer::ThreadPolicy
{
  void destroy (CORBA_Environment &ACE_TRY_ENV);
};

void
TAO_Thread_Policy::destroy (CORBA::Environment &ACE_TRY_ENV)
{
  //
  // Remove self from POA.  Because of reference counting, the POA
  // will automatically delete the servant when all pending requests
  // on this servant are complete.
  //

  PortableServer::POA_var poa = this->_default_POA (ACE_TRY_ENV);
  ACE_CHECK;

  PortableServer::ObjectId_var id = poa->servant_to_id (this,
                                                        ACE_TRY_ENV);
  ACE_CHECK;

  poa->deactivate_object (id.in (),
                          ACE_TRY_ENV);
  ACE_CHECK;
}

</PRE>

One additional step required is to make the POA responsible for the
servant after it has been registered with the POA:

<PRE>

  // Register with the POA.
  PortableServer::ThreadPolicy_var result = new_thread_policy->_this (ACE_TRY_ENV);

  // Give ownership of this servant to the POA.
  new_thread_policy->_remove_ref (ACE_TRY_ENV);

</PRE>

If you use the above approach of multiple inheritance, you must add
the following to your header file:

<PRE>

// This is to remove "inherits via dominance" warnings from MSVC.
// MSVC is being a little too paranoid.
#if defined (_MSC_VER)
# pragma warning (disable : 4250)
#endif /* _MSC_VER */

</PRE>
