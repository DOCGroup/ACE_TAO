     * @class TP_Task
     *
     * @brief Active Object managing a queue of request objects.
     *
     * There are two types of "users" of a TP_Task object:
     *
     *    1) The TP_Strategy object that "owns" this task object.
     *    2) The worker threads that "run" this task object as an
     *       "active object".
     *
     * The TP_Strategy object that "owns" this task object dictates
     * when the worker threads are activated and when they are shutdown.  It
     * also injects requests into this task's queue via calls to the
     * add_request() method.  It is also the TP_Strategy object that
     * dictates the number of worker threads to be activated via a call to
     * the set_num_threads() method.
     *
     * The active object pattern is implemented via the use of the
     * the ACE_Task_Base base class, and each worker thread will
     * invoke this task's svc() method, and when the svc() returns, the
     * worker thread will invoke this task's close() method (with the
     * flag argument equal to 0).
     *
     * @note I just wanted to document an idea...  When the pool consists
     *       of only one worker thread, we could care less about checking
     *       if target servant objects are busy or not.  The simple fact
     *       that only one thread will be dispatching all requests means
     *       that servant objects will never be busy when the thread
     *       tests to see if a request is "ready_for_dispatch()".  I'm
     *       just wondering if this knowledge can be applied to the
     *       implementation such that the "pool with one worker thread" case
     *       performs more efficiently.  This is STP vs SSTP.
