/* Provides an Iterator that expands and decodes a control string
   containing digits and ranges, returning an integer every time the
   generator function is called.  This is used to decode the user's
   key position requests.  For example: "-k 1,2,5-10,$" will return 1,
   2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 0 ( representing the abstract ``last
   character of the key'' on successive calls to the member function
   operator ().  No errors are handled in these routines, they are
   passed back to the calling routines via a user-supplied Error_Value */
