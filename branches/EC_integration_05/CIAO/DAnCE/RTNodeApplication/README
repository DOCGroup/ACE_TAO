This directory contains the deprecated RTNodeApplication
implementation.  It will be removed shortly.

* Currently, the RTNodeApplication does not support configuring of any
  RT policies.

* RTNodeApplication supports the following command line flags:

  * -n : Do not try to call back NodeApplicationManager.  This is only
         useful when testing the server and the server is not created
         by a NodeApplicationManager.

  * -o <filename> : Specify the filename NodeApplication will write
                    IOR to.  This is only useful when debugging also.

  * -k <IOR> : Specify the callback IOR to the NodeApplicationManager.

* Corresponding files to old RTNodeApplication:

  RTNodeApplication.cpp: Main program

  NodeApplication_Task.*: ACE_Task class for spawning the thread for
                          RT-NodeApplication using the right scheduling
                          strategy.

  RTNodeApplication_Impl.* : Actual RTNodeApplication server implementation.

  senv.sh: A simple shell script for setting up the run-time
           environment when starting NodeDaemon with sudo.
           This is necessary because the RTNodeApplication needs to
           spawn threads with real-time scheduling class.  This
           operation requires the process to be run by privileged user.
           You may need to tweak this shell script to suit your need.
           Here's an example of how to use the script:

            $ sudo senv.sh $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/NodeManager/NodeManager \
                -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost:10000 \
                -s $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RTNodeApplication/RTNodeApplication
