@page Client Leaks Test README File

	On TAO-1.1.12 the ORB was leaking handles on the client-side.
This test creates multiple servers trying to force a fault or
exception if the resources are still leaked.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
