<ul>

  <li>Exception handling is not implemented.  Maybe we should not try
      to use the environment variables/exceptions scheme again.
      Considering changing to a simpler error reporting method.

  <li>Need to verify predefined entities are working correctly.  Check
      out the SAXPrint example.

  <li>Currently, replacement of parameterized reference (PEReference) is
      not working.

  <li>The parser currently does not interpret namespace.

</ul>
