/**
@page acexml_bugs ACEXML Known Bugs

<ul>
  <li>ACEXML currently do not validate an XML files.

  <li>Exception handling is not implemented.  Maybe we should not try
      to use the environment variables/exceptions scheme again.
      Considering changing to a simpler error reporting method.

  <li>Need to verify predefined entities are working correctly.  Check
      out the SAXPrint example.

  <li>Currently, replacement of parameterized reference (PEReference) is
      not working.

  <li>Although most namespace supporting features/interfaces are
  there, the parser currently does not interpret namespace.

  <li>I'm sure this list will grow. :)

</ul>
