/**
@page acexml_todo ACEXML TO-DO List

<ul>

  <li>Make the parser dynamically loadable

  <li>Decouple ACE_Svc_Configurator from ACE Library.  Allow users to
      load in different configurator/parsers.

  <li>Add Namespace support.  The basic supporting mechanisms are
      already in place.  The parser itself, however, does not take
      advantage of them to differentiate the different namespace.

  <li>Add DTD parsing ability.  (almost done.)

  <li>Add Schema paring ability.  It is not clear to me, however, how
      to specify which schema a document is associated with.

  <li>Add support for resolving external entities, such as a
      schema/namespace definition located on the web.  There should be
      a factory object to create various kinds of @ref CharStream
      based on the URN or <i>PEReference</i> being parsed.

  <li>Add parameterized entity management class.  See above.

  <li>A char stream should be able to differentiate the file encoding
      and perform the correct transcoding automatically.

  <li>Need to support ACEXML_Locator in the parser.  There's currently
      no way to tell the location where the parser is parsing or where
      an error occurred.

  <li>Define validator building/calling interfaces.

</ul>
