/*
 * shexp.h: Defines and prototypes for shell exp. match routines
 *
 *
 * This routine will match a string with a shell expression. The expressions
 * accepted are based loosely on the expressions accepted by zsh.
 *
 * o * matches anything
 * o ? matches one character
 * o \ will escape a special character
 * o $ matches the end of the string
 * o [abc] matches one occurrence of a, b, or c. The only character that needs
 *         to be escaped in this is ], all others are not special.
 * o [a-z] matches any character between a and z
 * o [^az] matches any character except a or z
 * o ~ followed by another shell expression will remove any pattern
 *     matching the shell expression from the match list
 * o (foo|bar) will match either the substring foo, or the substring bar.
 *             These can be shell expressions as well.
 *
 * The public interface to these routines is documented below.
