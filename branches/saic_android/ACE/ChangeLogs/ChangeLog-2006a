        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp:
          Fixed main signature to resolve link errors in the Cygwin build.

Tue Apr 18 07:58:49 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp:
          Fixed warning in solaris build

Tue Apr 18 07:55:49 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile error in Cygwin build

Tue Apr 18 07:24:49 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added ImR_Client lib

Mon Apr 17 18:15:49 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp: Fixed compile error correctly.

Mon Apr 17 14:47:23 UTC 2006  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-macosx-tiger.h

          Added ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS.

Mon Apr 17 10:06:23 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp: Restrict building this test
          to platforms with both threads and AIO support. Fixes Cygwin
          build problem.

Sat Apr 15 10:57:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile error

Fri Apr 14 15:53:21 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * NEWS: Updated to reflect the changes and fixes below.

        * ace/Task.{h inl cpp}: Change ACE_Task::lock_ from ACE_Thread_Mutex
          to ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex, and hold lock_ across call to
          ACE_Task::close() in ACE_Task_Base::cleanup(). This guards against
          multiple threads in close() seeing a 0 thr_count() and acting on it.
          Thanks to Howard Finer <hfiner at sonusnet dot com> for this fix.
          Fixes Bugzilla #2339.

        * ace/SOCK_Stream.h: Explain more about how the *_n methods work and
          how to use the timeout and bytes_transferred arguments.

        * examples/Threads/task_three.cpp: Change name of the file static
          ACE_Thread_Mutex from lock_ to Lock to avoid clashing with the
          ACE_Task-inherited member lock_.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.{h cpp}: Changes that allow
          ACE_SSL_Asynch_Stream objects to be instantiated; required adding
          an implementation of the pure virtual implementation() method
          inherited from ACE_Asynch_Operation.
          Also moved the declaration of the ACE_SSL_Asynch_Read_Stream_Result,
          ACE_SSL_Asynch_Write_Stream_Result, and ACE_SSL_Asynch_Result classes
          from the .cpp file to the .h file so applications can see them.
          Also corrected and enhanced a lot of the documentation.

        * tests/SSL/tests.mpc:
        * tests/SSL/Makefile.am:
        * tests/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream_Test.cpp: Added a new test that at least
          tests building an application to use ACE_SSL_Asynch_Stream.

Fri Apr 14 14:57:12 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:

          Added a work-around for devenv using the solution file to build
          additional projects even when the .vcproj is specified.  This only
          happens when using the -CORE option to this script.  First, all
          .sln files are temporarily renamed and then named back when the
          build is done or a SIGINT or SIGTERM is detected.

Wed Apr 12 14:48:38 UTC 2006  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_component_dnc.mpb

          Fixes for linking errors in OS X.

Tue Apr 11 20:06:12 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (rewind): Replaced SetFilePointer() with
          fseek() on WinCE since it works better.  Thanks to Andrey
          Nechypurenko for reporting this.

Wed Apr 12 08:14:00 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_events_dnc.mpb:
          Added ciao_rtevent_dnc as base project to fix link errors in the
          VxWorks static builds

Tue Apr 11 14:10:00 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/transaction.cpp (handle_input): Return 0 on successful
          socket read, not the number of bytes. Thanks to Jason Zhang for this
          fix.

        * THANKS: Added Jason Zhang to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Apr 11 13:12:36 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Lib_Find.h:

          aCC 3.31 seems to want an extra newline at the end of this file.

        * ace/config-macros.h:

          ACE_NOTREACHED is reached for aCC up to 3.31 at least.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:

          Define ACE_LACKS_MEMBER_TEMPLATES for aCC 3.31 because it does.

Tue Apr 11 12:41:00 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_config_handlers.mpb:
          Added event config handles and add all projects to the after
          to get the correct build order

Mon Apr 10 18:37:17 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:

          Added Capabilities.cpp into the lib.
          Required by TAO/orbsvcs/examples/ImR/Advanced to
          use the getline function. The ace_for_tao lib is
          increased by 0.1M.

Mon Apr 10 18:04:00 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_container_dnc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb:
          Changed base projects

Mon Apr 10 10:27:03 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          Set up a guard for WIN32 && ACE_USES_WCHAR.

Mon Apr 10 09:36:00 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_rtevent_dnc.mpb:
          New base project

Mon Apr 10 09:13:00 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          New base project

Mon Apr 10 06:23:00 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_container_dnc.mpb:
          New file, matches library name

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_xml_utils.mpb:
          Use exceptions as base project

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb:
          Use ciao_events_dnc as base project

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_events_dnc.mpb:
          Add ciao_container_dnc and ciao_client_dnc to make things easier to
          maintain. Also use the CIAO_Dnc_Events library instead of the
          two seperate libs

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_svnt.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb:
          Removed CIAO_DnC_Events as seperate lib

Sun Apr  9 12:00:00 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * docs/ACE-bug-process.html: Updated this page to more accurately
          reflect how the DOC group handles enhancement requests.  Thanks
          to David White <david dot white dot 7 at gmail dot com> for
          motivating this.

Sat Apr  8 18:32:29 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Shared_Memory_MM.h (ACE_Shared_Memory_MM):
        * ace/Shared_Memory_SV.h (ACE_Shared_Memory_SV):
          Added comments that underscore that these classes should not be
          used and instead ACE_Malloc or ACE_Mem_Map should be used.
          Thanks to Qingbo Cai <qingbo dot cai at case dot edu> for motivating these
          comments.

Fri Apr  7 19:56:03 UTC 2006  Gan Deng  <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_events_dnc.mpb

          Modified to make CIAO_DnC_Events_Base and CIAO_RT_Event
          libraries explicitly specified in "libs +=" to resolve
          linking errors in BC compilers.

Fri Apr  7 13:13:06 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Add staticflags += ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for Library Unload

Fri Apr  7 07:36:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Token.{h,inl}:
          Fixed compile problem in single threaded no online build. Thanks
          to Ossama Othman for reporting this

Thu Apr  6 21:11:24 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp (private_key, context, dh_params): If setting
          up the new file fails, reset the corresponding
          ACE_SSL_Data_File member to allow retries to proceed.

        * NEWS: Added user-visible items for 5.5.1.

Thu Apr  6 19:15:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Thread.cpp:
          Fixed compile problem in single threaded no online build. Thanks
          to Ossama Othman for reporting this

Thu Apr  6 15:58:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Thu Apr  6 10:07:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/Bug_2497_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Added regression for bug 2497, we have to see what the best fix
          is. Thanks to Sergey Zubarev <sergant128 at mail dot ru> for
          providing reporting this.

Thu Apr  6 06:05:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macosx-tiger.h:
          Don't define ACE_SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE when it is already set. Can
          happen when we build for OS X on Intel. Thanks to Ignacio Alvarez
          <support at xentient dot com> for reporting this. This fixes bugzilla
          2496.

Wed Apr  5 23:02:50 UTC 2006  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

         Added TAO/tests/Bug_2494_Regression.

Wed Apr  5 22:03:52 UTC 2006  Gan Deng  <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_events_dnc.mpb

          Modify the project dependency so its built after
          CIAO_DnC_Container project. This should fix the
          errors on SuSE_FP_Stats build.

Wed Apr  5 19:32:19 UTC 2006  Gan Deng  <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb

          Added library dependency to CIAO_Events_DnC, so static
          build could resolve symbols in this library.

Mon Apr  5 14:59:37 UTC 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.h:

          Addressed access to locks that have already been destroyed by
          reintroducing some of the original static variable semantics.
          Some, but not all, of the exception-safety fixes that introduced
          the order of destruction problem were retained.

          (random_seed, egd_file, seed_file):

          Declared these methods "static" since they do not manipulate
          internal ACE_SSL_Context members.

Wed Apr  5 14:58:12 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          Set up a guard for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS.

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Add an empty Resource_Files section to the Library Unload project.

Wed Apr  5 14:25:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Wed Apr  5 13:10:00 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          Initialise local pointer with 0

Wed Apr  5 11:55:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Tue Apr  4 18:51:41 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (shared_open): If ACE_OS::listen() fails,
          guard errno before closing the socket to prevent loss of the error
          value, at least on Windows. Thank you to Aleksandar Vukajlovic
          <vukajlo at finsoft dot co dot yu> for this fix.

        * THANKS: Added Aleksandar Vukajlovic to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Apr  4 15:44:03 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Reverting my change from Mon Apr  3 12:12:27 UTC 2006 and changing
          the default from directory based building/dependencies to named
          targets (which is the way that all other make based MPC project
          types work).  This is being done by request (RT #8510).

Tue Apr  4 15:28:00 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          Cope when log file cannot be opened.

Tue Apr  4 15:06:00 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          Add guards for __MINGW32__ and __CYGWIN32__.
          Don't error if libACE isn't found.

Tue Apr  4 14:10:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Mon Apr  3 23:04:51 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Removed the explicit
          setting of ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE in CCFLAGS introduced at
          Wed Feb 22 16:26:43 GMT 2006  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>.
          ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE is set (or not) from config-aix-4.x.h
          depending on what template instantiation options were specified on
          the command line.

Mon Apr  3 13:45:29 UTC 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.inl:

          Fixed versioned namespace related errors for configurations that
          define ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T and/or ACE_LACKS_UNSIGNEDLONGLONG_T.

Mon Apr  3 13:45:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Mon Apr  3 12:12:27 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added support for a new workspace based setting that only makes
          sense to the 'gnuace' project type called 'named_targets'.  If
          'named_targets' is set, the workspace (GNUmakefile) will be
          generated such that each target can be built via it's project name
          and directory location does not affect dependencies.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Support the new source component scoped keyword 'buildflags'.

Mon Apr  3 10:25:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Mon Apr  3 09:38:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Remove PRISM_ONLY tests (again arg!)

Sat Apr  1 19:08:28 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_math.inl: Improved the computations for floor() and ceil().
          Thanks to Abdullah Sowayan <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com> for this
          patch.

Sat Apr  1 17:14:59 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Removed special cases for *freebsd*.  Thanks to Thomas Girard
          <thomas dot g dot girard at free dot fr> who sent patches for
          Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems (FreeBSD kernel / GNU libc).  The
          changes added *k*bsd-gnu patterns to override the special cases
          matched by *freebsd*.  However, further investigation has proved
          that they were not needed for FreeBSD either.

Fri Mar 31 23:51:48 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Changed to #include <sys/param.h> in the <sys/sysctl.h>
          feature test, avoiding the autoconf "present but cannot
          be compiled" warning.

Fri Mar 31 15:00:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

Fri Mar 31 13:59:04 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          Add guard for ACE_VXWORKS and declare local main().

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Remove Main.cpp reference from the Library Unload project.

Fri Mar 31 11:41:54 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.cpp: Reverted changes from
          Thu Mar 30 18:51:13 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          because they broke builds on many platforms.

Fri Mar 31 10:56:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Timer_List_T.cpp:
          Use prefix increment instead of postfix

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:
          Initialise pointer with 0

        * ace/Reactor_Token_T.h:
          Converted some documentation to doxygen style

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp:
          Initialise some pointers with 0, made some local variables const.

        * ace/IOStream_T.h:
          Fixed some doxygen warnings

Fri Mar 31 08:33:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          Added CPU_FLAG as possible flag, this can be -3/-4/-5/-6 to optimize
          things for a certain CPU, see the Borland help for more info what
          these flags do. When this is set, this is passed to the compiler

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Document CPU_FLAG for Borland

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          The Borland compiler can't handle assembly in inline methods or
          template methods. We do have inline assembly when building for
          pentium, so when we inlining enabled and do build for pentium
          we set ACE_LACKS_INLINE_ASSEMBLY to disable the inline assembly.
          Thanks to Steve Orner <saorner at rdainc dot com> for reporting
          this.

        * ace/Event_Handler.cpp (read_adapter):

          Fixed typo introduced in

Thu Mar 30 10:24:50 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Event_Handler.cpp (read_adapter): It was possible for
          handle_close() to "delete this" so we need to cache the reactor
          pointer and use it here.  Thanks to Yuan <yuanhp_china at
          hotmail dot com> for this fix.

Thu Mar 30 18:51:13 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp: Fixed broken fprintf() call.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h (ACE_thread_mutex_t):
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl: For Windows, replace CRITICAL_SECTION with a
          struct including a CRITICAL_SECTION as well as a recursion count.
          This allows us to properly do recursion in combination with a
          condition variable across all Windows editions and versions.

        * ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.cpp (get_nesting_level): This is now
          possible for platforms with ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_THREAD_MUTEX.

          Thanks to Adrian Tulloch <my-ace-sub at reyes-tulloch dot com> for
          these improvements.

        * THANKS: Added Adrian Tulloch to the Hall of Fame.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_svnt.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb

          Modified to support CIAO pub/sub service integration.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_events_dnc.mpb

          Added this mpb file for pub/sub service integration
          in CIAO.

Thu Mar 30 15:45:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          Corrected missing file handle.

Thu Mar 30 11:27:00 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:

          Define variable ACE_CC_PREPROCESSOR to be 'cc' if the SunCC version
          is 5.4. This fixes bug #2478.

          See also: Thu Mar 30 11:26:45 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Added BiDirectional_DelayedUpcall

Thu Mar 30 11:04:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Run BiDirectional_NestedUpcall also on VxWorks

Thu Mar 30 00:46:52 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Change the default of --enable-symbol-visibility option from yes
          to no.

Wed Mar 29 22:33:36 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Changed to #include <sys/types.h> in the <sys/sysctl.h>
          feature test, avoiding the autoconf "present but cannot
          be compiled" warning.

Wed Mar 29 19:26:37 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/TTY_IO.cpp:
          Do not try to control DTR under LynxOS. It sets serial port
          to non-functional state.

Wed Mar 29 14:14:06 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
        * m4/ace.m4:

          Changed --with-gperf to --enable-gperf to be consistant with the
          intent of --with-* / --enable-* flags.  Thanks to Vincent Joseph
          <deskamess at yahoo dot com> for running into this.

Wed Mar 29 13:25:12 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU

          Add code to ensure cleanup in ACE_Log_Msg::close (void).
          For some systems, e.g. LynxOS, we need to ensure that
          any registered thread destructor action for this thread
          is disabled. This is a revision of an earlier attempt to
          achieve the same thing. The ACE tests pass with this edition.

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp

          This source does not use ACE functionality directly.
          It tests that the ACE shared library can be safely loaded,
          (and unloaded), by a non-ACE program exercising the
          cleanup code above.

        * tests/run_test.lst
        * tests/tests.mpc

          Build and run the new test

Wed Mar 29 07:04:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Initialise pointers with 0, small const changes

Wed Mar 29 06:44:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * etc/*.doxygen:
          Also expand ACE_ENV_ARG_DECL_NOT_USED and
          ACE_ENV_SINGLE_ARG_DECL_NOT_USED

Tue Mar 28 21:30:01 UTC 2006  jiang,shanshan <shanshan.jiang@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h,cpp}
        * ace/Log_Record.{cpp,h,inl}:
          Updated these files to solve the stack overflow problem in ACE_Log_Msg
          and ACE_Log_Record. Moves buffers that can be large in stack in malloced
          memory.
          Thanks to qwerty <qwerty0987654321 at mail dot ru> for motivating and
          suggesting the fix to this problem.

Tue Mar 28 18:34:26 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Added a missing semicolon.

Tue Mar 28 14:51:19 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Added support for --disable-symbol-visibility flag so users
          can explicitly disable symbol visibility in the cases where
          it does not work (or does not work properly) but the feature
          test selects it anyway.

Tue Mar 28 09:04:55 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_resource.inl (setrlimit): Fixed a bug where
          "resource" appeared twice in the call to setrlimit().  Thanks to
          Vincent Joseph <deskamess at yahoo dot com> for reporting this.

Tue Mar 28 14:10:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to tests

Mon Mar 27 19:06:52 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Added test
          TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Security/MT_SSLIOP/run_test_harsh.pl to
          test fix for bug in Bug 1647.

Mon Mar 27 16:39:41 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc: Added a "verbatim" to get the automake-needed
          setup for running the scoreboard test script for the tests.

Mon Mar 27 14:16:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Mon Mar 27 07:46:33 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Acceptor.h: Updated the documentation to clarify that an
          acceptor can only listen on one port at a time.  Thanks to
          Mockey Chen <mockey dot chen @ google dot com> for motivating
          this.

Mon Mar 27 11:08:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Mon Mar 27 09:18:07 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Configuration.h:

          Remove 'explicit' keyword from a two arg constructor. This is
          upsetting aCC 331.

Mon Mar 27 03:57:38 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Check whether "gcc" supports symbol visibility options by
          invoking the compiler with those options.  This addresses
          configure failures due to icc's incomplete gcc emulation.
          Should fix bugzilla issues 2338 and 2384.

Sun Mar 26 21:40:10 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp: Added patches to silence the type-punning warning
          from G++ 4.x.  Thanks to Ken Sedgwick for contributing this
          stuff!

Sun Mar 26 17:29:08 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Add ACE_CHECK_CFLAGS and ACE_CHECK_CXXFLAGS autoconf macros
          to verify if c/c++ compiler supports the specified command-
          line options.

Fri Mar 24 12:05:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

Thu Mar 23 16:20:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Thu Mar 23 16:00:49 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer.cpp:

          Fixed two bugs.

          1) Line numbers were not calculated correctly as in most cases the
             new line characters were thrown away but not counted.
          2) Strings were not allowed to contain nested quotes.  However,
             the original lexer allowed this.  Thanks to JR Andreassen
             <janrune@io.com> for reporting this.

Thu Mar 23 14:37:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcl.mpb:
          Also set specific options for the bds template

Thu Mar 23 14:37:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          Updated documentation why we have a VxWorks specific
          workaround

Thu Mar 23 14:22:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Add lynxos platform default timing configuration

Thu Mar 23 12:14:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          If linkflags are available, generate them into the project
          file

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcl.mpb:
          Added -aa to the link flags to indicate that we link a
          windows application. This prevents a dosbox from appearing
          when we start a vcl windows app.

Thu Mar 23 03:41:18 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <john_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl (set):

        timespec_t doesn't have a 'sec' member. Changed it to 'tv_sec'.

Wed Mar 22 18:42:36 UTC 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        From Russell Mora <russell_mora at symantec dot com>
        * ace/Time_Value.inl:

          With MSVC8 the type of time_t is by default 64-bit unless
          _USE_32BIT_TIME_T is defined - changed #ifdef to recognise this
          and also changed other set() methods to use the version that
          knows how to handle the 64-bit type.

          Reverted my earlier change
          "Tue Mar 21 21:58:17 UTC 2006  Gan Deng
          <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>".

          I will put earlier changes back in later when all the
          libraries in CIAO to support pub/sub services have
          been checked in.

Wed Mar 22 16:19:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SENDMSG

Wed Mar 22 15:32:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.x_g++.GNU:
          Removed -fno-strict-prototypes from the CCFLAGS, thanks to
          Karl Schmitt <Karl dot Schmitt at dfs dot de> for reporting this.

Tue Mar 21 21:58:17 UTC 2006  Gan Deng  <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_events_dnc.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_dnc.mpb

          Added a base MPC project to support pub/sub integration
          in CIAO.

Tue Mar 21 19:06:12 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        Committing on behalf of Adam Mitz <mitza@ociweb.com>.

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:

          In some cases .EXE was not being added to the end of the
          executable name.  This change fixes that problem and also changes
          Spawn() to return -1 on failure instead of exiting.

Tue Mar 21 15:30:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Tue Mar 21 14:29:29 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          If system lacks the cpu_set_t type, skip the feature tests for
          sched_getaffinity() and sched_setaffinity().  The interface of
          these system calls have changed three times, and ACE currently
          only supports the latter two varients.  The supported varients
          both have arguments of type cpu_set_t.

          On a system with the first varient, the feature tests detects
          the existance of sched_getaffinity() and sched_setaffinity(),
          it also detects that it's the not most current varient.  This
          results in feature test macros being defined for the second
          varient, which causes a build failure in OS_NS_Thread.cpp.

          By avoiding the feature tests, we avoid defining any processor
          affinity related feature test macros, and ACE will be compiled
          as if the system does not support any form of processor
          affinity.

          See bugzilla issue 2466 for details.

Tue Mar 21 11:03:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * performance-tests/Misc/childbirth_time.cpp:
        * examples/OS/Process/imore.cpp:
          Fixed unicode build errors

Tue Mar 21 06:49:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Removed all PrismTech tests

Mon Mar 20 22:53:09 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Makefile.am: Restored hand-inserted settings to allow running
          the ACE tests during "make check". This needs to be added to the
          mpc file, but we're discussing how to do this.

Mon Mar 20 08:58:26 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Mon Mar 20 08:58:26 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Removed all references to egcs, which
          is hopelessly out of date..

Mon Mar 20 14:54:23 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Task_Ex_T.h:
          Added a workaround for buggy LynxOS 3.x compiler.

Mon Mar 20 10:15:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (post_process_socket_event):
          Before acquiring the token, first check if we really have to do some
          post processing, if not, then we just don't acquire the token. This
          fixes the performance drop in the TAO thread pool performance test.
          Thanks to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi dot cohenarazi at gmail dot com>
          for noticing this drop in the performance stats.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
          Small documentation improvement

Sun Mar 19 21:30:39 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html (href): Rearranged the order of things
          so that it explains how to build and install ACE before going
          into all sorts of details about various platforms and compilers.
          Thanks to Axter <google at axter dot com> for motivating this.

Sat Mar 18 15:20:45 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp (activate): Set active_ to 1
          in case we were deactivated.  Thanks to Yauheni Akhotnikau
          <eao197 at intervale dot ru> for reporting this.

Fri Mar 17 16:35:36 UTC 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/Symbol_Versioning.html:

          New document that describes how to use ACE's versioned namespace
          support.  [Bug 2458]

Fri Mar 17 15:50:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst
          Add more !DISABLE_ToFix_LynxOS_* marks to failing tests

Fri Mar 17 13:38:18 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciaocidldefaults.mpb:

          New file, containing cidl-related stuff removed from
          ciao_servant_dnc.mpb, which now inherits from the new
          base project. These changes allow CIAO applications
          to set up the build either in the existing way, where
          the servant build executes the CIDL compiler, then the

          C++ compiler on all the results, or to have separate

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
          Fixed variable not used warning

Fri Mar 17 08:56:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Fixed bugzilla #2395. This was about a race condition in the
          TP_Reactor, when the handle_x method returns -1 the handler
          is removed and after that we try to resume. Normally this resume
          is a noop because for the handle there is no event handler anymore.
          But to resume the handle we need to reacquire the lock on the
          reactor, in the time between the remove and the reacquire we could
          have received a new connection for which the handle is used which
          we already freed and then we can resume this handle but then for
          a new eventhandler. The fix is to do the remove and resume as atomic
          operation. Thanks to Bala Natarajan and Steve Huston for reviewing
          the patches and Kees van Marle for debugging and analyzing this
          problem.

Thu Mar 16 21:54:29 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp (grow_heap): Reset timer_ids_min_free_ after
          growing the heap. Fixes Bugzilla #2447 where timer IDs may be
          improperly duplicated under certain conditions.

        * tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp: Added a new function,
          test_unique_timer_heap_ids(), as supplied in Bugzilla #2447 to
          verify the fix.

          Thank you very much to Dan Pozdol <dpozdol at wolve dot com> and
          Paxton Mason <pmason at wolve dot com> for identifying the bug,
          its conditions and causes, supplying the test program and supplying
          the fix!

          an empty() method to be more like STL strings.  Thanks to
          Patrick Rabau <pr2345 at gmail dot com> for contributing this.

Tue Mar 14 23:33:27 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (recursive_mutex_cond_unlock): Fix this for
          WinCE. CE doesn't have a RecursionCount, and LockCount is not an
          indicator of recursion on WinCE; instead, see when it's unlocked
          by watching the OwnerThread, which will change to something other
          than the current thread when it's been unlocked "enough" times.
          Thanks to Spencer Vanroekel <Spencer dot Vanroekel at Siemens dot
          com> for the investigations leading to this solution.

        * ace/Event_Handler.cpp (read_adapter): Never pass the handler's
          handle value to handle_input(). The handle_input() call is being
          made on behalf of stdin, not any other handle. It also mimics
          the behavior of the non-Windows case, where ACE_STDIN is registered
          with the reactor, regardless of the handler's handle value.

Mon Mar  6 18:25:41 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/os_include/os_semaphore.h:

          Added an implementation for timed semaphore wait provided by
          Gottwald Port Technology.  It is very similar to the emulated
          semphore in the event that ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM is not defined.
          Previously, this was not supported at all when ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM
          was defined.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_time.h:

          Added sys to the file name to avoid Doxygen warnings.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_qt.mpb:

          This change coincides with a change in MPC where the qt library
          setting was changed.

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          I added !DISABLE_INTERCEPTORS to all the Security tests as
          both the TAO_Security library and TAO_SSLIOP library require
          interceptors.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Removed an extra dollar sign, that GNU Make apparently didn't
          care about but shouldn't have been there anyway.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.mpb:

          Removed this file.  It is redundant to the global.mpb found in
          MPC.

Thu Mar  2 00:51:18 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * NEWS: Added Win64 and WinCE notes.

Wed Mar  1 23:47:13 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/make_release: Added "wince=1" to the MPC -features option for
          the WinCE file generation; helps prevents WinCE-hostile projects
          from being generated.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h: VC8 still lacks sigatomic_t for WinCE 5.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h: Removed some compiler-specific settings that
          were moved to compiler-specific configs previously but not updated
          for CE. Updated things that are now available.

        * tests/CDR_File_Test.cpp:
        * tests/CE_fostream.{h cpp}: CE iostream hack not needed for CE when
          iostreams are available (VC 8, included).

        * examples/Reactor/TP_Reactor/ReadHandler.cpp:
        * netsvcs/servers/main.cpp:
        * tests/Array_Map_Test.cpp: Use ACE_TEXT around all pieces of
          concatenated string; VC8 WinCE misses the line ending.
          Removed ACE_TEXT around ACE_TRACE's argument; ACE_TRACE adds it.

        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.{h cpp} (init, parse_args): Changed argv
          from char*[] to ACE_TCHAR*[]. Also fixed some missing ACE_TEXTs.

        * examples/APG/Processes/Spawn.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Processes/Process_Mutex.cpp: Add missing ACE_TEXT around
          string args.

        * examples/NT_Service/NT_Service.mpc: Add avoids += wince - CE doesn't
          do services.

        * examples/Web_Crawler/main.cpp: Don't try SIGFPE protection if
          on WinCE.

        * examples/Web_Crawler/URL_Status.h: Changed STATUS_NOT_FOUND to
          STATUS_ITEM_NOT_FOUND and STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED to
          STATUS_OP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. CE apparantly has macros with these
          names that messes this up.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/WFMO_Reactor.mpc: Added wince to the
          "avoids" clause for APC, Registry_Changes, Talker and
          Window_Messages; WinCE doesn't the necessary features.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Window_Messages.cpp: Add missing
          #include "ace/Auto_Event.h"

        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp: Remove the #if ACE_WIN64 from the check
          for first send causes reset. This happens with 32-bit as well,
          at least on Win XP-64 SP2. It's unrelated to the functionality under
          test, and if there's an actual sending side botch that causes the
          socket to be closed prematurely, it should show up as another error
          in the server side.

Wed Mar  1 16:12:50 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Added !BAD_AIO to the Proactor_Test and
          Proactor_Test_IPV6. This makes it possible to avoid this test on
          platforms that simply aren't capable of performing decent AIO.

Wed Mar  1 10:22:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile problem

Wed Mar  1 09:48:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Env_Value_T.h:
          First to all template specializations before the generic one and
          use template<> for the specializations, this fixes the compile
          errors with GCC 4.1

Wed Mar  1 07:36:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Reactor/TP_Reactor/AcceptHandler.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/TP_Reactor/server.cpp:
          Fixed warnings in vc6 builds

Wed Mar  1 00:16:26 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.cpp (get_nesting_level): On Win64 with
          AMD64/EM64T, use the CRITICAL_SECTION's RecursionCount member, not
          LockCount, as was changed in this entry:
          Tue May  6 11:50:18 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>
          It remains to be seen under what conditions LockCount is used (it
          may be for Itanium, for example) but for now, use of RecursionCount
          is conditional to AMD64.

        * tests/Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test.cpp: Print some useful order info
          rather than ACE_ASSERT everywhere. Also fixed some ACE_TEXT stuff.

Tue Feb 28 23:28:57 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Add DEFAULT_INCLUDES definition that got lost during regeneration.
          Fixes autoconf builds on case-insensitive filesystems.

Tue Feb 28 19:46:16 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp: Add a special-case check for Win64. It
          appears that Win64 listen/accept side has some changed behavior
          but I haven't found any Windows docs to state this; just observed
          behavior. It appears that WinXP-64 will appear to accept connections
          at the TCP level past the listen backlog but if data arrives before
          the actual application-level accept() occurs, the connection is
          reset. I can see where this would be sensible for a web server or
          something like that, but it causes a problem for this use case where
          the test client side connects and starts sending.
          Note I also tried modifying the checks in the connect path (in
          ACE.cpp, handle_timed_complete()), but the connection really does
          appear to be accepted clean; a peek recv will complete without
          the reset being noticed, hence my speculation that Microsoft
          "enhanced" the behavior at the server side.
          Also, fixed a lot of bad indentation and some missing ACE_TEXTs.

Tue Feb 28 11:12:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwilemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Connector.cpp:
          Initialise several pointers explicitly with 0

Tue Feb 28 00:21:53 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-WinCE.h: Don't set ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_TOTALLY for
          MSVC 8 and up.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (grow_and_adjust):
        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp (consolidate): Avoid losing data when
          comparing ptrdiff_t values.

        * ace/Event_Handler.{h cpp}: Allow
          ACE_Event_Handler:register_stdin_handler to build on WinCE.

        * ace/FILE_IO.cpp (send, recv): Truncate the number of iovec tuples
          down to range of an int.

        * ace/OS_NS_stropts.{h cpp}:
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.{h cpp}: Allow QoS-enabled operations on WinCE
          5.0 and up.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl: 64-bit adjustments.

        * ace/Time_Value.{cpp inl}:
        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp: Add ACE_WIN64 to the platforms that use
          LONG_MAX/LONG_MIN rather than std::numeric_limits<time_t> for the
          time bounds. On Win64, time_t is 64 bits, yet the timeval members
          used internally to ACE_Time_Value are still long. This makes time
          values outside the LONG_MAX, LONG_MIN range very broken and many
          tests start failing in odd ways. Thanks to J.T. Conklin for this fix.

        * ace/Token_Request_Reply.{cpp inl}: 32/64 bit adjustments.

        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.{h cpp} (ACE_TS_Mutex, ACE_TS_WLock,
          ACE_TS_RLock): Changed the name argument from char* to ACE_TCHAR*
          to build clean on wchar systems. The classes that use this and that
          this uses already were ACE_TCHAR.

Mon Feb 27 22:36:20 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SSL/Makefile.am: Hand-corrected the addition of
          ACE_TLS_CPPFLAGS, ACE_TLS_LDFLAGS, ACE_TLS_LIBS needed to pick up
          user's specification of where the SSL libraries are.

Mon Feb 27 08:17:49 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (acquire_quietly): Moved the error message
          so that it only is printed if it's a real error, not just a
          timeout.  Thanks to Oh Yoon Sik <boom at estsoft dot com> for
          reporting this.

Sun Feb 26 19:21:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SOCK_IO.{cpp,inl}:
          Fixed compile errors, it is ACE_Utils::Truncate, not ACE_Truncate

Sun Feb 26 13:05:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Reactor_Timer_Test.cpp:
          Replaced asserts with ace_error to fix warnings in release builds

Sat Feb 25 22:57:32 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Process_Manual_Event_Test.cpp: On Windows, use a complete
          path name to spawn the child process with, else it doesn't work when
          the test is in a subdir of ACE_wrappers/tests, as it is with
          Win XP64 and WinCE.

        * ace/SOCK_IO.h: Clarify that on recvv() and sendv(), the number of
          iovecs handled will be limited to the maximum value of an int.
        * ace/SOCK_IO.inl (sendv, recvv): ACE_Truncate the 'n' number of
          iovecs passed down to the ACE level.
        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp (send, recv): Reduce the size_t n iovec count to an
          int range after dividing by 2 to fit it into the ACE_OS level.

Sat Feb 25 12:45:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Removed Security Policies tests, it has been removed from the repo

Fri Feb 24 23:43:04 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp:

          use std::numeric_limits<time_t>::max()
          and std::numeric_limits<time_t>::min() (or LONG_MAX and LONG_MIN
          for those platforms that lack std::numeric_limits<T>) instead of
          ACE_INT32_MAX and ACE_INT32_MIN for time bounds.

Fri Feb 24 21:16:48 UTC 2006  xiong,ming  <ming.xiong@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_config_handlers.mpb

          Add a verbatim to disable hidden_visibility for project
          dependent on Config_Handlers

Fri Feb 24 19:08:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          If we can't chdir to the directory then don't die, but just continue
          with the next test

Fri Feb 24 17:29:47 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Truncate.h: Include all needed code inline here and mark the
          function and specialization inline.
        * ace/Truncate.{inl cpp}: Removed. All code for ACE_Truncate is inlined
          and included in the Truncate.h file.

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am: Removed Truncate.cpp and Truncate.inl.

Fri Feb 24 16:31:36 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Connector.{h cpp}: Changed the non_blocking_handles_ member
          used to remember handles currently in-progress with a non-blocking
          connect from ACE_Handle_Set to ACE_Unbounded_Set. This enables
          ACE_Connector to be used with handle values outside the range
          that select() can deal with (FD_SETSIZE) and is needed to run
          large numbers of handles as is now possible with the
          ACE_Dev_Poll_Reactor.
          Removed the deprecated internal-only
          SVC_HANDLER* ACE_NonBlocking_Connect_Handler::close (void)
          method. There was already a replacement close() with more
          sensible arguments that performed close operations in the correct
          order, avoiding accesses to event handlers that were deleted.
          Don't ACE_ASSERT when seeing a ACE_Connector::close() error; log
          an error and keep going.

        * ace/Container_Instantiations.cpp: Added instantiations for
          ACE_Unbounded_Set<ACE_HANDLE>, used in ACE_Connector.

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (find_handler): Increment the found
          handler's reference count, as the other reactor implementations do.

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h: Fix typos.

Fri Feb 24 15:38:20 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Fix typo in last change:
          Thu Feb 23 23:00:45 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

Fri Feb 24 15:26:07 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Back out code dealing with system's that have a
          BROKEN_THREAD_KEYFREE after Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> pointed
          out that it breaks Task_Ex_Test.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the 'vpath' code so that it does not require knowlege of
          how MPC internally stores filename lists.  It does not change any
          functionality.

Fri Feb 24 00:19:22 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE_export.h: Changed ACE_INLINE_TEMPLATE_FUNCTION to use
          ACE_Export instead of "extern" for Visual C++. Fixes missing
          ACE_Truncate symbols outside of the ACE library on Windows.

Thu Feb 23 23:22:18 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Logging/Callback.h:

        * examples/APG/Logging/Callback-3.h: Add conditional areas for
          platforms lacking IOStream support.

Thu Feb 23 23:00:45 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Use "eval" when setting ACE_TCL_LIB to expand any variables in
          ${TCL_LIB_SPEC}.  Thanks to Thomas Girard <thomas dot g dot
          girard at free dot fr>.

Thu Feb 23 19:53:51 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.cpp:

          Changed so nothrow operator delete has same exception
          specification in declaration and definition.

Thu Feb 23 17:01:15 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

Thu Feb 23 14:44:54 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Add code to ensure cleanup in ACE_Log_Msg::close (void).
          For some systems, e.g. LynxOS, we need to ensure that
          any registered thread destructor action for this thread
          is disabled.

Thu Feb 23 14:54:52 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Tweak how ACE_TCL_CPPFLAGS, ACE_TCL_LIBS, ACE_TK_CPPFLAGS,

Thu Feb 23 09:16:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Reactor/TP_Reactor/*:
          Example program demonstrating the TP_Reactor. This is also a
          test program for bugzilla bug 2395. For reproducing start
          the perl script but also do other activity on the system,
          then it can happen that the same event handler is invoked
          from multiple threads. Thanks to Martin Kolleck and Tino
          Riethmueller for creating this example program.

Thu Feb 23 08:35:09 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

          Remove inclusion of ace/config-lynxos-pthread.h

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          If it's a macro we can't say "::pthread_cancel"

Thu Feb 23 09:02:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/DLL_Test_Impl.{h,cpp}:
          Added nothrow operator delete

        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/Signal.h:
          Documentation improvement

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp (operator*):
          Use correct type for usec

        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp:
          Use casts in operator delete

Thu Feb 23 08:08:26 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * tests/Makefile.am:

          Regenerate for TK Reactor changes.

Thu Feb 23 06:47:26 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_tk.mpb:

          Add automake specific section for TCL and TK CPPFLAGS and LIBS.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Change ace_enable_{fl,qt,tk,xt}_reactor to
          ace_user_enable_{fl,qt,tk,xt}_reactor for consistency.

          Implement ACE_PATH_TCL.

          Implement ACE_PATH_TK.

          Implement ACE_ENABLE_TK_REACTOR.

          Thanks to Thomas Girard <thomas dot g dot girard at free dot fr>
          for these fixes.

Wed Feb 22 20:56:17 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE_export.h: Added another macro, ACE_INLINE_TEMPLATE_FUNCTION,
          to take care of the compiler differences when an inlineable
          function template can be out-lined. Some compilers (e.g. Microsoft)
          like an extern storage class to prevent multiple instances; others
          (practically all others) refuse the extern storage class and
          resolve the multiples at link time.

        * ace/Truncate.{h inl}: Change ACE_NAMESPACE_INLINE_FUNCTION use to
          ACE_INLINE_TEMPLATE_FUNCTION.

Wed Feb 22 22:18:56 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Run some more tests on LynxOS.

Wed Feb 22 21:30:35 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Truncate.inl:
          Added include "ace/os_include/os_limits.h" to pull INT_MAX.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Define ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS when compiling with GCC 2.x.
          Define ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM on LynxOS 4.0.

Wed Feb 22 19:16:32 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE_export.h: Add __HP_aCC 06.05 and up to the list of compilers
          that don't like "extern inline".

Wed Feb 22 16:50:16 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.{h cpp}: Add operator= to set string from a
          CHAR*. Optimizes performance in this case by removing the need
          for a temporary object. Thanks to Kelly Hickel <kfh at mqsoftware
          dot com> for this improvement.

        * tests/SString_Test.cpp: Added test for new operator=.

Wed Feb 22 17:26:01 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/TTY_IO.h:
          Changed type of dtrdisable from int to bool.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/DEV_SAP/reader/reader.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/DEV_SAP/writer/writer.cpp:
          Changed to reflect recent changes in TTY_IO.h.

Wed Feb 22 16:31:28 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcl.mpb:

          Added the 'bmake' type in order to support VCL.

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Simplified these scripts by using FindBin.  Also, made a
          modification to preserve @ARGV so that when it is used by the
          workspace creators, it contains the original arguments provided by
          the user.

Wed Feb 22 16:26:43 GMT 2006  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:
        * THANKS
          Added templates=manual to set manually instantiated
          templates (without setting ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_
          INSTANTIATION) and determining that -qeh=v6 is needed
          to get the more general exception behavior.

          Thanks to Marc Brown and Andrew Keane for suggesting
          these changes.

Wed Feb 22 15:48:15 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp: Fixed mismatch signed/unsigned compare warning.

Wed Feb 22 08:33:03 UTC 2006  Don Sharp     <Donald.Sharp@prismtech.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU
        * ace/config-lynxos.h
          change settings for building dynamic libraries

        * ace/config-lynxos-pthread.h
          new file for handling LynxOS' use of macros

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp
        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h
          Handle broken thread key free on LynxOS

Tue Feb 21 23:49:20 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Truncate.{h inl cpp}: New function template, ACE_Utils::Truncate,
          for truncating types to int. Compares the value to the maximum int
          value and, if passed value is greater, returns the max int; else
          returns the original value cast to int. Useful for the many places
          that return int but maintain larger types (such as size_t)
          internally. There's a specialization for size_t since it's used so
          much.

        * ace/ace.mpc: Add Truncate.cpp

        * ace/Makefile.am: Added Truncate.{h inl cpp}

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp:
        * ace/Message_Queue.cpp: Use ACE_Utils::Truncate() to return size/count
          related values that may overflow the range of an int. Prevents odd
          conditions that may appear as failures when dealing with very large
          numbers of items in a queue. And, resolves compile warnings.

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp: In constructor, add checks to see if max_size_
          is outside the range of a long and reduce it if so. This ensures we
          can cast size_t values to a long as a timer ID (pop_freelist).
          NOTE!!! In grow_heap(), the size is doubled and there's no check for
          failures in range or in allocation. This a problem that should be
          looked at.

        * ace/Service_Manager.cpp (reconfigure_services):
        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp:
        * ace/UPIPE_Connector.cpp (connect): Fix compiler warnings.

Tue Feb 21 23:08:38 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.cpp: Add missing close brace for blank namespace
          in ACE_HAS_WINCE case.

Tue Feb 21 20:20:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * protocols/ace/TMCast/MTQueue.hpp:
          Initialise pointer to 0 to fix gcc4.1 warning

Tue Feb 21 19:26:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Fixed typo in this file

        * bin/generate_compile_stats.sh:
          Improved this script, print date/time after the Detail in html, also
          when we can't find the footprint size of an object file, just list it
          with ? as size, that way we can at least see all objects and don't
          miss any.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Default use_dep_libs to 1

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Only when use_dep_libs is set to 1 (which is the default) set DEPLIBS.
          In the footprint builds we set use_dep_libs to 0 because it causes
          problems when interpreting the map files generated by the linker.

Tue Feb 21 19:14:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Process_Manual_Event_Test.cpp:
          Fixed this test

Fri Feb 17 08:15:57 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.h: Used ACE_DEFAULT_ASYNCH_BACKLOG instead
          of ACE_DEFAULT_BACKLOG since the latter is set to a huge value
          on Windows.  Thanks to Alex Libman and Daniel <__daniel___ at icg
          do tu-graz dot ac dot at> for their help.

        * ace/Default_Constants.h: Added a new macro called
          ACE_DEFAULT_ASYNCH_BACKLOG that defaults to 5.

Mon Feb 20 15:03:01 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * ACE version 5.4.10 released.

Sun Feb 19 13:38:32 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release:
          Fixed bug in excluding of mwc files

Fri Feb 17 19:16:32 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * NEWS:

          Updated this file with more inputs.

Thu Feb 16 13:38:39 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * bin/generate_rel_manpages:

          Updated the script with latest info at naboo.dre.

Thu Feb 16 13:38:00 UTC  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Added regression test for Bugzilla 2403

Thu Feb 16 09:23:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release:
          Changed the exclude of mwc files, use TAO_* and CIAO_*

Thu Feb 16 08:33:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/performance_stats.sh:
          Added AMI to the combined performance figure

Wed Feb 15 20:06:42 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp: Fixed cancel() so that it doesn't miss any
          nodes due to reheapifying during a remove.  Thanks to Oh Yoon
          Sik <boom at estsoft dot com> for this fix.

Wed Feb 15 20:04:13 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          #include <sys/time.h> in ACE_HAS_POSIX_TIME feature test (if
          supported by platform).  Thanks to Vladimir Panov <gbr at
          voidland dot org> for reporting this bug.

Wed Feb 15 19:58:36 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Modified the check_for_long_file_names function to correctly deal
          with the length of the MPC project names instead of the length of
          the .mpc file itself.  The length of the .mpc file name does not
          necessarily indicate the length of the generated project name.

Wed Feb 15 18:16:02 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:

          Adding/subtracting 0.999999 from max and min is required to really
          represent a saturated time value.

Wed Feb 15 12:32:37 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer.cpp:

          Changed two instances of memcpy() to memmove().  The areas being
          copied could possibly overlap.

Wed Feb 16 11:40:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Added new AdvSlotExt PI test

Wed Feb 16 07:54:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:
          Disabled visibility by default, seems to cause some issues in the
          builds at this moment

Tue Feb 14 22:56:39 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Added *.core to list of files to clean.

Tue Feb 14 22:04:46 UTC 2006  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/security.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ssliop.mpb

          Fixes for linking errors/warnings in OS X.

Tue Feb 14 21:43:01 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          #include <sys/types.h> before <sys/mman.h> in
          ACE_LACKS_MADVISE_PROTOTYPE feature test.  Thanks to Vladimir
          Panov <gbr at voidland dot org> for reporting and providing a
          patch for this bug.

Tue Feb 14 18:36:16 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:

          Changed operator *= to use std::numeric_limits<time_t>::max()
          and std::numeric_limits<time_t>::min() (or LONG_MAX and LONG_MIN
          for those platforms that lack std::numeric_limits<T>) instead of
          ACE_INT32_MAX and ACE_INT32_MIN when saturating the results.

          This uses the correct limits for whatever underlying type time_t
          is when std::numeric_limits<T> is available, and uses the limits
          for the traditional type, long, when it is not.

          Removed call to normalize(), as set() already normalizes results.

Tue Feb 14 14:47:00 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          When checking for maximum length of mpc files, ensure that only
          .mpc files are checked.

Tue Feb 14 08:34:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SHMDT

Tue Feb 14 08:24:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Svc_Handler.{h cpp}: Add ACE_LACKS_PLACEMENT_OPERATOR_DELETE
          around the operator delete with nothrow. This fixes the compile
          errors with Borland C++

Mon Feb 13 17:50:49 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Svc_Handler.{h cpp}: Add placement operator delete to match
          the nothrow variant placement operator new. This ensures proper
          cleanup if the constructor throws an exception.

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Only set ACE_LACKS_PLACEMENT_OPERATOR_DELETE
          for aC++ versions earlier than A.03.55.02. Fixes Bugzilla #2394.

Mon Feb 13 18:23:27 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Fix typos in ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SHMAT and ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SHMDT
          feature tests.

Mon Feb 13 09:33:20 UTC 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h (ACE_IMPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARATION):
          (ACE_IMPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARE):

          Comment out these macro definitions.  The "extern template"

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          If the -i option is passed, create a dependency file even if there
          are no source files.  This will allow NMake files to proceed
          without warning.

        * bin/generate_export_file.pl:

          we had some new mwc files which caused an overwrite of
          GNUmakefiles.

          Changed the void* argument of shmdt and shmat to a const void*,
          introduced ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SHMAT and ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SHMDT for
          the platforms that have a char* version of these methods.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.{h,cpp}:
          Don't export ACE_EH_Dispatch_Info and ACE_TP_Token_Guard, it are
          internal classes. Renamed grab_token to acquire_read_token as the
          todo mentioned, addded private copy constructor and assignment
          operator for ACE_TP_Token_Guard, no copying should be allowed

        * ace/Unbounded_Queue.cpp:

          Use prefix increment/decrement

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          Merged the two pipe methods to one and replaced some c-style casts
          with C++ casts.

          Refactored num_processors, use sysconf when _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF is
          defined, when ACE_HAS_SYSCTL has been set we use sysctl
          Refactored num_processors_online, use sysconf when
          _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN is defined, when ACE_HAS_SYSCTL has been
          set we use sysctl.

Thu Feb  9 20:07:59 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:

          Some platforms pollute the namespace with a max() macro, which
          makes it impossible to invoke std::numeric_limits<T>::max().
          #undef max after all the headers have been #included.

Thu Feb  9 18:51:16 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          #include <sys/types.h> in the ACE_HAS_2_PARAM_SCHED_GETAFFINITY
          and ACE_HAS_2_PARAM_SCHED_SETAFFININTY feature tests.  Thanks to
          Doug McCorkle <mccdo at iastate dot edu> for reporting this bug.

Thu Feb  9 20:05:00 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

Thu Feb  9 17:40:17 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp (ACE_OS::strerror):

          Don't use strlen() to see if length is zero, check if the
          first char is null (O(1) vs. O(N)).

Thu Feb  9 16:59:40 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * test/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:

          Align test_reactive() and test_concurrent() so the same
          error/warnings are emitted.

        * Flag_Manip.cpp:
        * IPC_SAP.cpp
        * MEM_IO.cpp:
        * SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp:

          Change type of FIONBIO and FIONREAD ioctl from u_long,
          ACE_INT32, etc. to int for portability.

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:

          Use std::numeric_limits<time_t>::max () instead of LONG_MAX
          as ctor's first argument when initializing ACE_Time_Value::
          max_time if !ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS, as time_t may not be
          a long. Fixes Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test on NetBSD/amd64.

        * configure.ac:

          Added ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS feature test.

        * ace/README:

          Document new ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS feature test macro, which
          should be defined to 1 if platform lacks std::numeric_limits<>.

        * ace/Cached_Connect_Strategy_T.cpp (cached_connect):

          Handle ETIMEDOUT as we do for EWOULDBLOCK.  Fixes
          Cached_Conn_Test on NetBSD systems.

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/config-netbsd.h:
        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
        * ace/config-macosx-panther.h:

          Change ACE_HAS_SIN_LEN to ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_IN_SIN_LEN.

        * ace/README:

          Document new feature test macros ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_IN_SIN_LEN and
          ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_IN6_SIN6.

          Removed description of ACE_HAS_SIN_LEN.  This macro was defined,
          but not used anywhere in ACE, TAO, or CIAO.  It's being removed
          rather than used because the new macros follow our feature test
          naming conventions.

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/INET_Addr.inl:

          Set the sockaddr_in.sin_len and sockaddr_in6.sin6_len members if
          new ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_IN_SIN_LEN or ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_IN6_SIN6_LEN
          feature test macros are defined.

Tue Feb  7 23:28:29 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SPIPE_Acceptor.cpp (close): On Windows, wait for completion
          (cancellation) of an outstanding ConnectNamedPipe operation. If
          left outstanding and the ACE_SPIPE_Acceptor object is deleted, the
          OS will write into deleted memory. Thanks to Nathan Bamford
          <nbamford at datalever dot com> for reporting this.

        * THANKS: Added Nathan Bamford to the Hall of Fame.

Wed Feb 08 15:46:51 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * ACE version 5.4.9 released.

Mon Feb  6 18:39:20 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * NEWS:

          Updated with info from Doug Schmidt.

Mon Feb  6 15:49:57 UTC 2006  Wallace Zhang  <zhangw@ociweb.com>

        * NEWS:

          Updated with info from Steve Huston.

Mon Feb  6 14:44:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Improved documentation for the BCBVER environment setting which
          is required for building with the Borland C++ compilers

Fri Feb  3 23:48:32 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Barrier.h: Noted shutdown() was added for 5.4.9.

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.{h cpp}: Changed enqueue_head(), enqueue_tail()
          to recognize that the ACE_Message_Block passed may have other
          block(s) connected to it via the next() pointers. This allows a
          caller to pre-connect a series of ACE_Message_Blocks and coalesce
          the enqueueing of the series into a single method call.
          Thanks to Guy Peleg <guy dot peleg at amdocs dot com> for suggesting
          this enhancement.
          Also revamped the Doxygenization of ACE_Message_Queue's
          documentation.

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp: Added chained_block_test() to test
          the new functionality above.

Fri Feb  3 14:47:53 UTC 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Cleanup_Strategies_T.h:

          Added missing versioned namespace declarations.

        * ace/Guard_T.h:

          Fixed versioned namespace related errors in single-threaded
          builds with that feature enabled.

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:

          Forward declare the ACE_WFMO_Reactor_Test class outside of the
          versioned namespace.  This test class is actually declared in
          the global namespace of a standalone test.

Fri Feb  3 07:53:16 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (setsockopt): Make sure to
          map WSAEOPNOTSUPP to the ENOTSUP errno value so the code is
          portable across versions of sockets!  Thanks to David Hauck
          <davidh at netacquire dot com> for this fix.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (setsockopt): Only check for
          WSAEOPNOTSUPP on platforms that actually support this macro!
          Thanks to Wallace Zhang for reporting this.

Thu Feb  2 23:59:37 UTC 2006  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * html/index.html

          Removed the XML_helpers link, as that documentation is no
          longer generated.

Thu Feb  2 23:41:39 UTC 2006  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb

          Added zlib to the feature inherits to resolve linking errors
          on Windows.

Thu Feb  2 13:35:18 Pacific Standard Time 2006  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:

          Fixed versioned namespace related errors in single-threaded
          builds with that feature enabled.

Thu Feb  2 17:49:42 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.h:

          Add ACE_Export decoration to ACE_OS::fast_memcpy() declaration.

Thu Feb  2 15:47:35 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Map_Manager/Map_Manager.mpc:

          Added an mpc file to create the right kind of project.  The
          symptoms of bad or missing mpc files are stray library symbolic
          links.

Thu Feb  2 14:48:03 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * Makefile.am:

          Build examples and tests subdirectories after building
          protocols.  I think all of the HTBP, RMCast and TMCast examples
          and tests should be moved underneath protocols eventually , but
          it's too close to the release to do it safely.

Thu Feb  2 11:19:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Naming_Test.cpp:
          Moved some real test code out of ACE_ASSERT calls

Thu Feb  2 06:15:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Fixed !ACE_FOR_TAO additions

Tue Jan 31 22:08:57 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Barrier.{h cpp}: Added a new shutdown () method which aborts all
          waiting on the barrier. Thanks to John Lilley <jlilley at datalever
          dot com> for contributing this method.
          Also note that the wait() method can now return -1 with errno
          ESHUTDOWN if the barrier is shut down while waiting for it.

        * tests/Barrier_Test.cpp: Added a test for barrier shutdown.

        * THANKS: Added John Lilley to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Jan 31 21:34:34 UTC 2006  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/ciao_tests.lst

          Added the hello test *without* naming service so we get results
          even on platforms with a broken/nonextant Naming Service.

Tue Jan 31 16:51:27 UTC 2006  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/ciao_tests.lst
        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst
        * tests/run_test.lst

          Added a bunch of !ACE_FOR_TAO qualifiers to tests that are not
          built/runnable when the ACE_FOR_TAO feature is used.

        * tests/run_test.lst

          Removed the avoid of ace_for_tao from the Dirent test, as Dirent.cpp
          is now built as part of ace_for_tao.

Tue Jan 31 09:44:10 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_shm.{h,inl}:
          Reverted my change below, removed the const, it causes problems with
          solaris, have to add a special case for solaris, but will do that
          after x.4.9 is out

          Fri Jan 27 12:36:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          * ace/OS_NS_sys_shm.{h,inl}:
            Changed for the shmdt and shmat methods the void* argument to
            const void*, this is the way posix defines these methods.

Mon Jan 30 17:53:10 UTC 2006  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/ciao_tests.lst

        Added a !NOXERCES qualifier so it is possible to run only tests
        that do not require xerces.

Sat Jan 28 18:40:30 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Array_Base.h (class ACE_Array_Base): Changed private to
          protected to enable access to certain members in derived
          classes.  Thanks to luxi78@gmail.com for suggesting this.

Fri Jan 27 23:29:44 UTC 2006  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.{h,inl}:
          Doxygen improvements and enabled inlining in the inline file again,
          this was disabled and I could find that someone disable this 7 years
          ago because of a bug in the Sun compiler at that moment. The current
          supported versions don't have a problem with this, so enabled
          inlining again in this core part of ACE.

Fri Jan 27 03:09:01 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * Makefile.am:
        * m4/ace.m4:

          Remove support for --{enable,disable}-ace-perftests.  The
          performance tests are now enabled/disabled with the plain
          --{enable,disable}-ace-tests option.  We decided this as
          flags for each type of example and test gets a unwieldly
          once we factor in TAO (and sometime in the future CIAO).

        * Makefile.am (SUBDIRS):
        * m4/ace.m4: Added support to enable/disable building the ACE tests,
          performance tests, and examples.  Thanks to Thomas E Lackey
          <telackey at bozemanpass dot com> for contributing this.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dance_extension_stub.mpb

          Added a new MPC base project for DAnCE.

Thu Jan 26 15:38:38 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * protocols/ace/RMCast/Template_Instantiations.cpp: Replace the
          separate long and long long instantiations with u64 instantiations.
          This is what the code says, and avoids issues with 64-bit
          explicit instantiations builds.

        * tests/Message_Block_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Manual_Event_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:
          Moved real code out of ACE_ASSERT macro's, this functionality
          wasn't executed in release mode builds. Found this because of
          warnings in the Intel release build that a variable was used
          before it was assigned a value.

        * bin/generate_compile_stats.sh:
          Extended this script to generate a seperate page for the CIAO
          footprint stats. Also made the generated png images the size
          of 800x600 and get the gcc version from gcc itself instead of
          generating it hardcoded

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.inl:
          Use ACE_VXWORKS instead of VXWORKS and introduced

        * ace/OS_NS_signal.{h inl}:
        * ace/OS_TLI.h: The method-name-same-as-struct-name hack for HP aC++
          needs to go up through version 03.65. This compiler version is used
          on HP-UX 11iv2 on PA-RISC, so the hack can't be expunged when
          removing HP-UX 11.00 support. The hack does not appear to be needed
          for aC++ on HP-UX on Integrity (aC++ v06.xx). Also see
          Mon Jan 23 16:35:40 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Mon Jan 23 20:19:25 UTC 2006  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/ciao_tests.lst

          Removed the "Exceptions" qualifier from the CIAO tests, as we
          no longer support emulated exceptions, and we want these
          tests to run everywhere.

Mon Jan 23 18:07:00 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Event_Channel.cpp: Put the ACE_INET_Addr
          setup on separate lines to help aC++ optimizer get it right.

Mon Jan 23 16:35:40 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_TLI.{h inl}: HP aC++ 03.56 (last aC++ for HP-UX 11.00) gets
          confused with struct t_optmgmt being defined as extern "C" by the OS
          and referenced in namespace ACE_OS by ACE. To help this compiler
          deal, typedef ACE_TOPTMGMT appropriately, with extern "C" for
          aC++ less than 03.60 and normally for all other compilers. This
          should take care of the odd t_optmgmt errors.

          When we remove support for HP-UX 11.00, this hack should be removed
          as well.

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Reactive_IO.cpp: Replace #include "ace/OS.h" with
          #include "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h". Leaving OS.h gets HP aCC into a state
          where it gets confused about methods and types with the same name,
          in this case t_optmgmt.

Mon Jan 23 15:51:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          RTEventLogAdmin libraries.

Mon Jan 23 08:02:08 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Pipe.cpp: Added static_cast<u_short> (0) rather than
          (u_short) 0 to the ACE_INET_Addr local_any in ACE_Pipe::open().

Sat Jan 21 08:19:34 UTC 2006  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html:

          Fixed unused paramerer warnings.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/IO.h:
        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/IO.cpp:

          tried to fix the 'cast to pointer from interger of different size'
          warning. It had to do with the fact that x86_64 void* are 8 bytes and
          the cast was from an int which 4 bytes. When James Hu wrote that
          code there were no 64 bit archs so the error is showing up now.

Fri Jan 20 15:05:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.h:

          exceptions in the interfaces

Fri Jan 20 13:56:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Replace VXWORKS with ACE_VXWORKS and guarded the following
          macros with ACE_LACKS_DEPRECATED_MACROS so that usage of these
          deprecated macros within ACE/TAO is prevented: ACE_USING,
          ACE_SYNCH_1, and ACE_SYNCH_2

Fri Jan 20 11:29:54 UTC 2006  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@kolpackov.net>

          Small cygwin update

        * ace/Mem_Map.h:
          Doxygen improvements

          ACE_OS::filesize returns off_t

Wed Jan 18 18:22:13 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Event_Channel.cpp:

          Updated because constructors of ACE_INET_Addr are now explicit.

Wed Jan 18 06:55:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_4_4BSD_SENDMSG_RECVMSG

Tue Jan 17 20:37:05 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventlogadmin_serv.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventlogadmin_skel.mpb:

          Split RTEventLogAdmin Service into three libraries:
          RTEventLogAdmin, RTEventLogAdmin_Skel, and RTEventLogAdmin_Serv
          for client stubs, servant skeletons, and service implementation
          respectively.

Tue Jan 17 20:28:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Module.h:
          Doxygen improvement

Tue Jan 17 19:56:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_P_READ_WRITE and removed ACE_LACKS_READDIR_R, this
          is for Cywin 1.5.19

Tue Jan 17 18:50:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/INET_Addr.{h,cpp}:
          Improved doxygen, changed VXWORKS to ACE_VXWORKS and make one
          of the constructors that has two arguments, one has to be passed
          the other has a default value explicit

Tue Jan 17 17:38:46 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/display_logfile.cpp: In the Logrec_Module
          constructor, don't use base-class initialization to pass &task_
          to ACE_Module. Doing so passes &task_ before task_ has been
          constructed. Thus, when ACE_Module sets the task's module
          pointer, it gets overwritten when task_ is constructed after
          return from ACE_Module's constructor. Calling task_'s module()
          method in this case will yield a 0 pointer, which is not correct.
          To remedy this, call ACE_Module::open() directly from within
          the Logrec_Module constructor.
          Also see Stroustrup pg 307.
          Thanks to David Hawkins for pointing this out.

Tue Jan 17 15:37:29 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taodefaults.mpb:

          If the corba_messaging feature is disabled, then add the
          TAO_HAS_CORBA_MESSAGING=0 macro to ensure that TAO is built
          properly.

Tue Jan 17 14:03:14 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Module.h: Change ~ACE_Module to be virtual so that derived
          classes can be cleaned up properly. Thanks to David Hawkins
          <dwh at ovro dot caltech dot edu> for this fix.

        * THANKS: Added David Hawkins to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Jan 17 01:12:35 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Pipe.cpp (open): Added a cast to u_short for the first
          parameter to ACE_INET_Addr to avoid complaints on certain
          compilers.  Thanks to Wallace Zhang for reporting this.

Mon Jan 16 06:59:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Jan 16 15:17:22 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Pipe.cpp (open): Changed

          to

          ACE_INET_Addr local_any  (0, ACE_LOCALHOST);

          so that it will work more portably.  Thanks to Steve Huston for
          suggesting this fix.

Mon Jan 16 19:44:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SOCK_IO.cpp:
          When using FIONREAD the 3rd argument should be of type int. This
          fixes bugzilla bug 2360. Thanks to Michael Klein
          <michael dot klein at fazi dot de> for reporting this.

        * ace/SV_Semaphore_Complex.h:

        Checking the some changes to JAWS. This is the code that adds the ability
        to start the server without file caching. This functionality is necessary
        for the proper coordination of file creations and deletions between JAWS
        and the RepositoryManager in CIAO. The changes are explained in the README.
        I have added a line in the svc.conf file which shows how to enable this new
        functionality.

Mon Jan 16 05:54:44 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp (svc): Added a fix so that
          this code will work for both regular timers and high-resolution
          timers.  Thanks to Eric Tiangang <tgliu@utstar.com> and Robert
          Iakobashvili <coroberti at gmail dot com> for this fix.  This
          fixes bugid 2348.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (LD):
          Pass -O3 to GNU-linker to reduce footprint due to ld
          optimizations.  Thanks to Robert Iakobashvili <coroberti at
          gmail dot com> for this enhancement.

Sun Jan 15 19:20:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SOCK_IO.{cpp,inl}:
          Removed several casts which where not needed and only cause
          problems with 64bit builds

Sun Jan 15 18:57:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:

Sun Jan 15 06:06:38 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/avstreams.mpb:

          Update to inherit from property_serv. as this project uses a
          collocated property service --- property.mpb now only brings
          in the client stubs.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/concurrency.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/concurrency_serv.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/concurrency_skel.mpb:

          CosConcurrency, CosConcurrency_Skel, and CosConcurrency_Serv for
          client stubs, servant skeletons, and service implementation
          respectively.

Sat Jan 14 12:59:39 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Pipe.cpp (open): Added a workaround so that "localhost:0"
          is used rather than sap_any to avoid triggering firewall rules
          on Windows.  Thanks to Paul Felix <pef@fluent.com> for this fix.

        * ace/ACE.h (ACE): Updated the documentation for ACE::fork() to
          indicate that -1 or 1 are returned if avoid_zombies != 0.  This
          is a bug that needs to be fixed at some point.  Thanks to Tobias
          Herzke <tobias.herzke@uni-oldenburg.de> for reporting this.

Fri Jan 13 19:06:33 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Reorder some function feature tests so they're closer to
          alphabetical order.  This makes it easier to maintain.

Fri Jan 13 17:56:53 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added ACE_LACKS_SYSTEM feature test.

Fri Jan 13 09:38:21 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

Fri Jan 13 12:22:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (~TSS_Cleanup_Instance):
          Set the members to zero after a delete because it are static
          ones.

Fri Jan 13 11:47:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * test/test_config.h:

          Changed so the very first thing we do is #undef ACE_NDEBUG.

        * test/OS_Test.cpp:

          Changed to make "test_config.h" the first header to be
          #included, as it #undef's ACE_NDEBUG.  This ensures ACE_ASSERT()
          will be defined so it validates its expression even for debug=0
          builds.  Without this, all the checks in this file are compiled
          out.  Fortunately unreferenced symbol warnings made us aware of
          this problem.

Fri Jan 13 07:53:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

Fri Jan 13 04:49:41 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Changed to use AC_SEARCH_LIBS for the -lsocket and -lnsl
          libraries before calling ACE_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS.  Third party
          libraries may those libraries, and if they haven't been added to
          $LIBS, the feature tests will fail.

Thu Jan 12 20:30:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
        * ace/README:
          Added ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME_MONOTONIC, this is the patch from
          bugzilla bug 2358. Not closing that one yet, have to see how
          to autoconf this and where this new macro should be set. Thanks
          to Robert Iakobashvili <coroberti at gmail dot com> for these
          patches

Thu Jan 12 19:50:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Assert.h:

          Windows

Thu Jan 12 16:44:40 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Functor.{h inl}: Using ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T wasn't good enough
          for deciding when to do an ACE_Hash<[unsigned] long long>. MSVC6
          can't hack it. So, do the specialization for the 64-bit types if
          ACE_SIZEOF_LONG < 8, avoiding a duplication of ACE_Hash<long>.
          Also, since the way "unsigned long long" is declared varies across
          compilers, use ACE_[U]INT64 rather than the native C++ type.

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (string_to_addr): u_short always compares >= 0,
          so rely on the indicated end of successful scan from ACE_OS::strtol()
          to say whether it scanned all digits or stopped short of the end of
          the string.

Thu Jan 12 12:59:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          For rtp mode, set PIC correctly

Thu Jan 12 12:01:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          When building for rtp also set DLD

Thu Jan 12 11:51:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          For rtp model we don't need to make sure the shared object
          directory is the same as static

Thu Jan 12 11:45:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          Fixed some comments after endif

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

Thu Jan 12 10:34:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          Improved building executables for rtp

Thu Jan 12 10:10:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Removed all support for VxWorks 6.1, this version wa just an
          intermediate step from 5.5 to 6.2. The port never completed and
          we are aimin at 6.2 at this moment, so to not give false
          impressions removed all the support for 6.1.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.1.GNU:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.1.h:

Thu Jan 12 01:08:32 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.pc.in:

          Added @LIBS@ to Libs.

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL.pc.in:

          Added @ACE_TLS_LDFLAGS@ and @ACE_TLS_LIBS@ to Libs.

          Added @ACE_TLS_CPPFLAGS@ to Cflags.

Wed Jan 11 22:17:39 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * protocols/ace/RMCast/Template_Instantiations.cpp: Added missing
          explicit instantiations.

Wed Jan 11 21:19:21 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Functor.{h inl}: Remove the ACE_* type specializations and
          add specializations for ACE_Hash for [unsigned] short,
          [unsigned] int, [unsigned] long, [unsigned] long long. This
          should resolve the compile errors on some platforms resulting
          from the changes in:
          Tue Jan 10 23:04:06 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          and still allow everything to work regardless of what integral types
          are used.

Wed Jan 11 11:43:42 2006  Ossama Othman <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        From Richard Ward <richard_ward at symantec dot com>
        * ace/Auto_Ptr.h (ACE_AUTO_PTR_RESET):

          Assign "NEWPTR" macro argument to a temporary "TYPE" pointer,
          and use that pointer in place of "NEWPTR" to force "NEWPTR" to
          be expanded only once.  Prevents a memory leak from occuring
          when "NEWPTR" is an expression such as "new foo".

          Delete the object released from the auto_ptr<>.  Previously it
          was ignored, resulting in a memory leak.  Fixes a memory leak.

        * THANKS:

          Added Richard to the Hall of Fame.

Wed Jan 11 18:58:15 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Assert.cpp:
        * ace/Assert.h:

          Added const qualifier to __ace_assert() "expression" parameter.

Wed Jan 11 17:36:44 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Assert.h:

          Use ACE_VERSIONED_NAMESPACE_NAME prefix for __ace_assert()
          invocation.

Wed Jan 11 14:24:20 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * Makefile.am:

          Updated.

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:

          Added Assert.cpp to Source_Files section.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:

          Changed to #include "ace/Assert.h", as the ACE_FACTORY_DEFINE
          macro uses ACE_ASSERT.

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:

          Changed to #include "ace/Assert.h" for backwards compatibilty
          with earlier ACE releases.

        * ace/Assert.cpp:
        * ace/Assert.h:

          Factor ACE_ASSERT() macro out of Log_Msg.h into new files
          Assert.h, with a helper-function in Assert.cpp.  This reduces
          the footprint of an ACE_ASSERT() invocation to a single call.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Corrected a problem in determining if depgen.pl is the dependency
          generator.  The logic can now handle the instance where the script
          is preceded by /usr/bin/perl (or something similar).

Wed Jan 11 06:47:04 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (~TSS_Cleanup_Instance): Delete the mutex and condition
          variable to prevent memory leaks.  Thanks to Domingos Monteiro
          <d dot monteiro at netia dot net> for this fix.

Tue Jan 10 23:04:06 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Functor.{h inl}: Added specialization for ACE_Hash<unsigned long>
          to help the explicit instantiation build get along.

Tue Jan 10 22:30:21 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (string_to_addr): Correctly identify a specified
          port number of "0". Thanks to Guy Peleg <guy dot peleg at amdocs
          dot com> for this fix.

        * THANKS: Added Guy Peleg to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Jan 10 20:05:54 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

           Ensure that the correct object files get cleaned up when doing a
           make clean.  Logic was duplicated in this file (but did not
           correspond to the correct logic found in the gnu.mpd or
           rules.lib.GNU).

Tue Jan 10 17:45:10 UTC 2006  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Added TAO/orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo/IFR_Inheritance_Test/run_test.pl.

Tue Jan 10 17:09:26 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Add feature tests for ACE_LACKS_CHDIR, ACE_LACKS_DUP2,
          ACE_LACKS_GETPID, ACE_LACKS_ISATTY, ACE_LACKS_SETPGID, and
          ACE_LACKS_UNLINK.  Re-arrange some things so the tests are
          closer to alphabetical order -- this makes the file easier
          to maintain.

Tue Jan 10 16:35:35 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/ChangeLogEditor/ChangeLogEdit.pm:
        * bin/cle.pl:

          Removed references to the name "CVS".  At this layer, the revision
          control system is unknown.

Tue Jan 10 13:36:55 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer.cpp:

          Modified GNU specific code to compile with the -pedantic option.

Tue Jan 10 13:21:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          Compilation for rtp mode is now the default

Tue Jan 10 13:14:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks6.1.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
          Only define ACE_MAIN in kernel mode

Tue Jan 10 11:36:43 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added feature tests for ACE_LACKS_DUP, ACE_LACKS_GETEGID,
          ACE_LACKS_GETEUID, ACE_LACKS_GETGID, ACE_LACKS_GETUID,
          ACE_LACKS_PIPE, ACE_LACKS_SETEGID, ACE_LACKS_SETEUID,
          ACE_LACKS_SETSID, ACE_LACKS_SETGID, and ACE_LACKS_SETUID.

Tue Jan 10 10:10:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux-10.x.h:
        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_SETEGUID and ACE_LACKS_SETEUID

Tue Jan 10 10:02:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          Simplified a lot of methods in this file by adding new ACE_LACKS
          macros. For VxWorks and psos we now also return -1 with notsup
          for the uid methods, these methods just don't work on these
          platforms because they are not there and we don't have multiple
          users. This will make this file much easier to maintain

        * ace/config-chorus.h:
        * ace/config-integritySCA.h:
        * ace/config-psos-diab-mips.h:

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Added the new ACE_LACKS macros from OS_NS_unistd.inl

Tue Jan 10 07:21:19 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/WFMO_Reactor_Logging_Server.cpp:

          Update for change below.

        * examples/C++NPv2/Reactor_Logging_Server.h:
        * examples/C++NPv2/Reactor_Logging_Server_T.h:

          Renamed Reactor_Logging_Server.h to Reactor_Logging_Server_T.h.
          When ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRES_SOURCE is not defined (as is so in
          the automake build), the Sun Studio 11 C++ compiler associates
          Reactor_Logging_Server.h with Reactor_Logging_Server.cpp instead
          of Reactor_Logging_Server_T.cpp when instantiating templates.
          This results in interesting (and difficult to track down) errors.

Mon Jan  9 20:20:14 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Explicitly automake conditional BUILD_ACE_FOR_TAO to false
          (at least for now).

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Small tweaks to fix errors introduced by MPC generation.

Mon Jan  9 20:19:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/makeicc.pl:
          Removed this file, it is ancient

Mon Jan  9 19:08:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace_wchar.h:
          VxWorks rtp has int_t

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
          Rtp has wchar.h and wctype.h

        * ace/OS_NS_String.{h,inl,cpp}:
          Updated the wchar_t methods that has a int_t argument to use wchar_t
          instead. That matches the opengroup definition and resolved the
          compile errors with VxWorks. Also replaced some c-style and static
          casts with const_casts.

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
          VxWorks 6.2 in rtp mode has a lot of wchar_t functionality, use it!

Mon Jan  9 18:32:55 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Regenerated for Service Configurator parser changes:
          Mon Jan  9 15:18:49 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added Hash_Map_Manager.h to Header_Files section.

Mon Jan  9 18:03:50 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added ACE_LACKS_GETOPT and ACE_LACKS_SYSCONF feature tests.

        * ace/UTF8_Encoding_Converter.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Added Unicode support to the Service Configurator by hand-coding
          the lexer portion to properly take into account non-US UTF8,
          UTF16 and UTF32 encodings.  Some of the UFT16 and UTF32 conversion
          code came directly from Unicode, Inc.

          This is a drop-in replacement for the flex generated lexer and
          heap allocates the encoding converters.  However, this version
          performs less heap allocations and has a smaller footprint than
          the flex generated lexer.

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.UTF-16.conf:
        * tests/Service_Config_Test.WCHAR_T.conf:

          Added byte order marks to ensure that they are interpreted

        * ace/OS_NS_unisth.{h,cpp}:
          Integrated patches of bugzilla bug 2357, thanks to Volker Lukas
          <vlukas at gmx dot de> for delivering this. This adds setuid(uid_t),
          setgid(gid_t), getuid() and getgid().
          Also introduced ACE_LACKS_SYSCONF and ACE_LACKS_GETOPT to make
          the VxWorks 6.2 port cleaner

        * ace/config-integritySCA.h:
        * ace/config-psos-diab-mips.h:

          Added ACE_LACKS_SYSCONF and ACE_LACKS_GETOPT to the appropriate
          config files

Mon Jan  9 14:14:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_main.cpp.{h,cpp}:
          The VxWorks specific way of handling main shouldn't be used
          when building for the rtp model, then the normal main should
          be used

Mon Jan  9 13:44:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Added TAO/tests/Bug_2349_Regression/run_test.pl

Mon Jan  9 11:27:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:
          Added ACE_LACKS_PUTENV. VxWorks 6.2 seems to have this method
          declared, but when linking in rtp model we get an unresolved
          external. So, just disable it for the moment, send a test
          case for this to WindRiver

Mon Jan  9 10:47:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          Improved build rules for the rtp model

Mon Jan  9 09:36:29 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Fix typo in ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM feature test.

Mon Jan  9 09:30:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Doxygen improvements

Mon Jan  9 09:16:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.{h,inl}:
          Changed the return type of filesize to off_t, that is the type to
          be used for filesizes

Mon Jan  9 07:59:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          VxWorks 6.2 defines PIPE_BUF as -1, this is not correct, undef it
          when it is defined as -1.

Sun Jan  8 19:34:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
          Updated some more to reflect the OS correctly.

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Updated for vxworks 6.2

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp:
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.{h,cpp}:
          Added ACE_OPCODE_ for the OpCode enums READ and WRITE, READ is also
          a define under VxWorks making this problematic to enable

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          Improved rtp building rules

Sat Jan  7 13:34:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.{h,inl}:
          For the sec accessor methods use time_t as type, that is also the
          type used to store the number of seconds.

Sat Jan  7 13:29:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW. Msvc8 throws std::bad_alloc by default,
          for the ACE_NEW macros we disable this, we just get a zero back on
          out of memory. This fixes bugzilla bug 2333

Sat Jan  7 13:17:12 UTC UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_NONCONST_WCSDUP

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Process_Manager.h:

          There can be a race condition if a process exits between the
          time it is spawned and the time its handler is registered.
          Changed the spawn() methods to take an optional handler so
          it can be registered atomically.

Thu Jan  5 15:37:32 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Add ACE_LACKS_UNAME feature test.

          Introduced ACE_LACKS_UNAME and refactored ACE_OS::uname a
          little bit. VxWorks 6.2 does deliver uname in the new rtp model,
          this file explicitly checked for some OS defines, adding there
          the new rtp check was making it real complex, so added this new
          define and set it in the appropriate config files. Also handle
          some new processor architecture defines windows now has.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_utsname.inl:
          Removed this file, was empty

        * ace/Makefile.am:

Thu Jan  5 09:52:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.2.GNU:
          Improved rtp model support

Wed Jan  4 21:25:11 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ChangeLog:

          Changed "add-log-time-format" to a really ugly lambda expression
          that formats changelog timestamps in UTC and works with both GNU
          Emacs and XEmacs.

Wed Jan  4 19:50:27 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/ChangeLogEditor/ChangeLogEntry.pm:

          Modified this to use UTC instead of local time.

Wed Jan  4 18:44:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Fixed 64bit conversion warning

Wed Jan  4 11:04:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Generate LIBNAME and PRJ_TYPE, needed for VxWorks rtp support

Wed Jan  4 10:49:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
          In rtp mode we can't access the WIND_TCB struct anymore, meaning
          that the TSS emulation can't work anymore.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Only call the native tss methods when they are available

Wed Jan  4 09:39:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_time.h:
          Added workaround for VxWorks 6.2 that defines timeval in time.h

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
        * ace/README:
        * ace/Time_Value.inl:
          Removed checks for !ACE_HAS_BROKEN_TIMESPEC_MEMBERS, this define
          is not set in any config file, so zapped it

Wed Jan  4 08:30:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
          Improved support for the diab compiler

        * ace/TTY_IO.cpp:
          Only define the const char arrays when they are going to be
          used. Fixes unused variable warnings with vxworks

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_un.h:
          Made VxWorks specific includes dependent on the VxWorks version.
          VxWorks is getting more and more posix compliance which means we
          don't have to include special VxWorks header files. Also use
          ACE_VXWORKS to check for this

Tue Jan  3 21:31:29 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ChangeLog:

          Add "indent-tabs-mode: nil" to Local Variables at end of file.
          Untabify.
          Delete-trailing-whitespace.

Tue Jan  3 14:26:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwilemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
          Don't use maxFiles with VxWorks 6.2

Tue Jan  3 13:03:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwilemsen@remedy.nl>
