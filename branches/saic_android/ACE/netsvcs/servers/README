This directory contains the driver program that links the various
services together, either statically or dynamically, to form complete
server programs.

You can configure the following ACE network services into the driver
program by changing how the svc.conf file is setup:

	. Logger -- Controls the output of all services that are
	  invoked along with the Logger service. Please see the README
	  file in /netsvcs/lib for details on how to control the output.

	. [Thr_]Server_Logging_Handler.* -- Implements server portion
	  of the ACE distributed logging service.  Both multi-threaded
	  and single-threaded implementations are provided.

	. Client_Logging_Handler.* -- Implements the client portion
	  of the ACE distributed logging service.  Note that you
          generally will run a netsvc daemon that's configured with
          *either* the server portion of the logging service or the
          client portion of the logging service, but not both in
          the same process.  In other words, you'll need to have
          separate svc.conf files to configure the client logging process
          and the server logging process independently.

	. Name_Handler.* -- Implements a distributed name service that
	  allows applications to bind, find, and unbind names in
	  a distributed system.

	. Token_Handler.* -- Implements a distributed token service
	  that allows distributed applications to acquire and release
	  locks in a distributed system.

	. Time_Handler.* -- Implements a distributed time service that
	  allows distributed applications to synchronize their
	  time.
