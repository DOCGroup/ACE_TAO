          Checkin of rework until now, not happy with the interfaces yet, now
          the test app seems to work a little, I am going to review all
          changed interfaces again and improve things.

        * tao/POA.{h,cpp}:
          - Changed adapter_state_changed to use IORInterceptor_List
          functionality to call adapter_state_changed on all IORInterceptors
          - Changed access of some methods
        * tao/IORInfo.cpp:
          Commented out some add_refs on the ORT, this should be done in the
          ORT Adapter. Need to check this

        * tao/ObjRefTemplate/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter_Factory.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/ObjRefTemplate/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Impl.{h,cpp,inl}:
          New files with first implementation

        * tao/IORInterceptor/IORInterceptor_List/{h,cpp}:
          Added adapter_state_changed, this gets a normal
          TAO_ObjectReferenceTemplate_Array, converts this into a corba
          sequence and calls adapter_state_change for each interceptor.

        * tao/PortableServer/diffs/Default_ORT.diff:
          Zap this file

        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter.h:
        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter_Factory.h:
          Corrected export macro

Tue Aug 17  90:31:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter_Factory.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect include

        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter.h:
          - Added adapter_name as constructor argument
          - Added destroy() method, called by POA when this adapter is not
          needed anymore, adapter must do its own cleanup
          - Added activate() method with just a ORT* to activate the adapter
          with an existing factory.
          - Added get_adapter_template and get_obj_ref_factory to get the real
          servant, this is needed for the IORInterceptors

        * tao/PortableServer/POA.{h,cpp,i}:
          - Added invoke_key_to_object_helper() which will check for the ORT and
          if available will call that or will call invoke_key_to_object
          instead.
          - Added object_reference_template_adapter() which will check
          ir an ORT Adapter is already available, if not, tries to get an
          ORT Adapater Factory, if that is available, create a new ORT
          Adapter.
          - Added some doxygen grouping to group methods belonging to each other
          in one doxygen group.
          - Added ort_adapter_ member to store the ORT Adapter when we have
          retrieved one.
          - Removed set_adapter_template() from the header file, there is no
          implementation of this method and it is not needed
          - Added TAO_POA_Static_Resources to store the name of the ORT factory,
          used the TAO_ORB_Core_Static_Resources but I didn't it put it there
          because the ORB_Core doesn't need to know anything or ORT.
          - Removed old ort_template, def_ort_template and obj_ref_factory and
          its usage.

        * tao/PortableServer/Default_ORT*.*:
        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate.{h,cpp,i}:
          Removed these files, default ORT implementation is now in the ORT
          library

        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter.{h,cpp}
          New file with base calss for ORT Adapters

        * tao/PortableServer/ObjectReferenceTemplate_Adapter_Facotry.{h,cpp}
          New file with base calss for ORT Adapter factories
