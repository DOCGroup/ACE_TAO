Running the Workspace Generator
-------------------------------

The most common way to use the Make Project Creator is to run the
workspace generator (mwc.pl).  This script will generate projects and a
single workspace that contains the generated projects.  If no input file
(.mwc file) is specified, it will recurse into the directory in which the
script was started.  It looks for .mpc files and generates a project or
projects for each one found.


Usage: mwc.pl [-global <file>] [-include <directory>]
              [-template <file>] [-ti <dll | exe | lib>:<file>]
              [-type <gnu | nma | vc6 | vc7>] [files]

       -global     Specifies the global input file.  Values stored
                   within this file are applied to all projects.
       -include    Specifies a directory to search when looking for base
                   projects, template input files and templates.  This
                   option can be used multiple times to add directories.
       -ti         Specifies the template input file (with no extension)
                   for the specific type as shown above
                   (ex. -ti exe:vc8exe)
       -type       Specifies the type of project file to generate.  This
                   option can be used multiple times to generate multiple
                   types.


The default global input file
(ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.mpb) is used if -global
is not specified on the command line.

Two include directories are used by default
(ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config and
ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates) if -include is not used.

Each project creator has a default template input file for each type of
project (exe, dll, lib).  You can override the default template input file
name with the -ti option.  The file must have a 'mpt' extension and must
reside within the include search directories.  NOTE: the 'lib' template
input file is only used if the project creator makes a separate project file
for dynamic libraries and static libraries.

The -type option can be used multiple times on the same command line to
generate projects of different types per mpc file.  NOTE: The -ti option
overrides the template input file for all types specified.


Running only the Project Generator
----------------------------------

Most of what is stated about the Workspace Generator applies to the Project
Generator except that it only generates projects.  If an input file (.mpc
file) is not provided, the project creator will attempt to create a default
project in the directory from which the script was started.


Usage: mpc.pl [-global <file>] [-include <directory>]
              [-template <file>] [-ti <dll | exe | lib>:<file>]
              [-type <bor | ghs | gnu | nma | vc6 | vc7>] [files]

       -global     Specifies the global input file.  Values stored
                   within this file are applied to all projects.
       -include    Specifies a directory to search when looking for base
                   projects, template input files and templates.  This
                   option can be used multiple times to add directories.
       -ti         Specifies the template input file (with no extension)
                   for the specific type as shown above
                   (ex. -ti exe:vc8exe)
       -type       Specifies the type of project file to generate.  This
                   option can be used multiple times to generate multiple
                   types.
