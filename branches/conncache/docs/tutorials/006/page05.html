<P>Well, that's it!&nbsp; After all the talk &amp; the hype, you would
have expected it to be more difficult to create a multi-threaded server.&nbsp;
Surprise!&nbsp; It really is that easy.&nbsp; You still have to handle
contention issues which we haven't addressed here and that is a rather
nasty topic.&nbsp; Still, for the simple case, this is all you have to
do.

<P>The next page is the last for this tutorial.&nbsp; Head on over there
&amp; we'll round up the file list one last time.
