This is the README file for the Repository Manager (RM).

Building RM:
In order to be able to compile the RM you need to have ZLIB lib because the RM
uses it to read the contents of CCM packages. In order to compile the RM 
successfully you will need to do the following: 
1.Download the binary version of ZLIB or build it yourself
3.Create an "include" and a "lib" subdirectory. Then copy the libraries files into
  the "lib" subdirectory and copy zlib.h into the "include" subdirectory.
4.Set $ZLIB_ROOT to point to the directories where you placed the libraries and
  the include files.
5.Turn on zzip and zlib in default.features for MPC.
6.MPC will handle the rest.

If you want to get the component package through http server:
1.Be sure to set JAWS_DOCUMENT_ROOT to the installation path of the RepoMan, i.e., $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager.
2.Start JAWS: $ACE_ROOT/apps/JAWS/server/main

Start RM:
1.Using ior file: 
  RepositoryManagerDaemon -o
2.Using Naming Service:
  RepositoryManagerDaemon -v [NameofRM]

Using RMadmin:
1.Install component package: (use BasicSP for example)
  Be sure you have BasicSP.cpk in the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/packages
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -i -l packages/BasicSP.cpk
  or
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -i -l http://127.0.0.1:5432/packages/BasicSP.cpk (If the JAWS is started)
  This will create the BasicSP directory, BasicSP.cpk file and BasicSP.epc file in the 
  $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager/
2.Delete component package: (use BasicSP for example)
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -d
3.Find component package by its name: (use BasicSP for example)
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -f
4.Stop RM:
  > RMadmin -o -s
  This will create the RM_record file in the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager/ which record the 
  names and UUIDs of the installed component packages.
