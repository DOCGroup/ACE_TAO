        * connectors/dds4ccm/examples/Quoter/Base/Quoter_Base.mpc:
        
          Added 'libpaths += ../lib' to skel project.

        * connectors/dds4ccm/examples/Quoter/Connector/Quoter_Connector.mpc:
        
          Removed DDS_Quoter_Base_skel from servant lib list - Quoter_Base.idl
          contains only a struct, and does not generate a skel lib since there
          is no exported code on the skel side.
