/**
 * @class TAO_ESF_Delayed_Changes
 *
 * @brief TAO_ESF_Delayed_Operations
 *
 * This class implements the Delayed Operations protocol to solve
 * the concurrency challenges outlined in the documentation of
 * TAO_ESF_Proxy_Collection.
 * In short the class delays changes by putting them on an
 * "operation queue", the operations are stored as command objects
 * in this queue and executed once the system is quiescent
 * (i.e. no threads are iterating over the collection).
 * The algorithm implemented so far is:
 * - If a thread is using the set then it increases the busy
 * count, this is done by calling the busy() method. Once the
 * thread has stopped using the collection the idle() method is
 * invoked and the busy count is decreased.
 * A helper class (Busy_Lock) is used to hide this protocol
 * behind the familiar GUARD idiom.
 * - If the busy count reaches the busy_hwm then the thread must
 * wait until the count reaches 0 again.
 * This can be used to control the maximum concurrency in the
 * EC, matching it (for example) with the number of
 * processors. Setting the concurrency to a high value (say one
 * million) allows for an arbitrary number of threads to execute
 * concurrently.
 * - If a modification is posted to the collection we need to
 * execute it at some point.
 * Just using the busy_hwm would not work, the HWM may not be
 * reached ever, so another form of control is needed.
 * Instead we use another counter, that keeps track of how many
 * threads have used the set since the modification was
 * posted. If this number of threads reaches max_write_delay then
 * we don't allow any more threads to go in, eventually the
 * thread count reaches 0 and we can proceed with the operations.
 * - There is one aspect of concurrency that can be problematic: if
 * thread pushes events as part of an upcall then the same thread
 * could be counted twice, we need to keep track of the threads
 * that are dispatching events and not increase (or decrease) the
 * reference count when a thread iterates twice over the same
 * set.
 * This solves the major problems, but there are other issues to
 * be addressed:
 * + How do we ensure that the operations are eventually executed?
 * + How do we simplify the execution of the locking protocol for
 * clients of this class?
 * + How do we minimize overhead for single threaded execution?
 * + How do we minimize the overhead for the cases where the
 * threads dispatching events don't post changes to the
 * collection?
