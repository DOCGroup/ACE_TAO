The files in this directory build several libaries comprising
the TAO Lightweight Fault Tolerance (LWFT) service. Additional
files to build the ReplicationManager and HostMonitor
executables are found in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/LWFT_Service.

Some preprocessor flags must be set by hand to build and use
LWFT. TAO_HAS_EXTENDED_FT_INTERCEPTORS must be defined to 1,
either in $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h or in $TAO_ROOT/tao/orbconf.h.
Adding the #define in orbconf.h has the advantage of causing
fewer libs to be rebuilt, but the disadvantage of the fact that
orbconf.h is in the source code repository, and so care must
be taken not to check in a modified version inadvertently.

To make the CPU load monitor in the LWFT_HostMonitor library
functional, ACE monitor must be enabled, which is done by
#defining ACE_HAS_MONITOR_FRAMEWORK to 1 in
$ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h. If this is not done, the load will
always show as its default initialized value of 0.
