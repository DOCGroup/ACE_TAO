This directory contains an illustration of a security
aware application that accepts secured and unsecured
requests and provides access to certain operations
only for secured requests.

This example uses a single set of service configuration
files and takes a single path through the application
code.

For simplicity, the pass phrases have been stripped from the
private keys included with these examples in the 1.2a release.
This *should not* be construed as a recommended practice.  Instead,
OCI strongly recommends that the security requirements of each
real-world application be evaluated carefully and that appropriate
procedures and practice be established accordingly.  Private keys
without pass phrase protection are easily compromised and may
allow an unauthorized party to masquerade as an authorized system
user.

Prior to running the server in these examples, the SSL_CERT_FILE
environment variable must be set, e.g.,
	# /bin/bash
	export SSL_CERT_FILE=cacert.pem
or
	rem Windows
	set SSL_CERT_FILE=cacert.pem

To run the server:
	./MessengerServer -ORBSvcConf server.conf

To run the client:
	./MessengerClient -ORBSvcConf client.conf
