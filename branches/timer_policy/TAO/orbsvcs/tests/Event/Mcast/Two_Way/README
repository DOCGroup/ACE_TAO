Goals:
------
The goal of this test is to verify that federation of Event Channels
using multicast works correctly.  Unlike "Simple" and "Complex" tests,
this test can have any number of Event Channels participating in the
federation, and each participating Event Channel has a full duplex
multicast communication, i.e., both sends and receives events via multicast.

Description:
------------
There are two executables: federation-enabled Event Channel an
application, which acts both as EC consumer and supplier.  Any number
of EC/application executable pairs can be started for running the test.

Each application subscribes with its EC for heartbeat events, and,
while listening, also pushes (at regular intervals) 50 heartbeat
events to its EC.  Each heartbeat event contains info identifying its
source (hostname + process id).  Applications keep track of all the heartbeat
events they receive, and print out the summary before shutting down.

Command-line Options:
---------------------
Application: $application -ORBInitRef Event_Service=<ior> [-d]
where
-d indicates that the application will destroy its Event Channel
   before exiting.  If each application has its own private Event
   Channel, each should use this flag, to have all executables terminate
   automatically.  If more than one application is using the same
   Event Channel, then only one of those applications should use "-d"
   option.

Mcast-equipped EC: $gateway_ec -ORBsvcconf <conf_file> -i <ior_file>
where
<ior_file> is the name of the file to which the ior of the Event
           Channel will be printed
<conf_file> is a service conf file used to configure the Event Channel
            and the multicast components.  See consumer-ec.conf or
            supplier-ec.conf for examples, or
            $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_Mcast_Gateway.h for
            all valid multicast configuration options.

To run:
-------
Automagically (runs three EC/application pairs):
$ run_test.pl

Manually:
As many times as desired (using a different ior file name each time) do
$gateway-ec -ORBsvcconf gateway.conf -i ec.ior
$application -ORBInitRef Event_Service=file://ec.ior -d
