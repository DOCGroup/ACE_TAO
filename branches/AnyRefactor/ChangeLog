        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/anytypecode.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoclient.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidldefaults.mpb:
          By default we now suppress Any and Typecode generation with -Sa
          and -St but when the AnyTypeCode library is used, then these
          options are removed from the idl flags. This way simple apps
          don't get this lib by default

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-7.h:
        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h:
          Removed disabling of warning 4290

        * ace/CORBA_macros.h:
          Removed special ACE_THROW_RETURN for win32 and HP aCC, this
          is not needed and only gives a lot of warnings at level 4
          with msvc

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:
          Added AnyTypeCode as base project, just to get things building,
          will have to remove this later and derive the correct projects

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoclient.mpb:
          Just for short, added anytypecode to the client. This should really be
          dependent on the idl compiler flags
