This test demonstrates the problem described in bugzilla entry #3647.

In this test we have three participants:

A) A back-end server that will inconveniently block in the middle of
   its work
B) A middle-tier server that is trying to communicate with the back
   end server using SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT oneway calls, with timeouts.
C) A client application that is sending twoway calls to the
   middle-tier server.

The expectaton is that when the back-end server completely blocks, the
middle-tier server will continue to operate normally.  That is, the
oneway calls to the back-end server will block it, the timeouts will
expire, but the recursive loop will be available to respond to any
incoming requests from the client application.

What we observe is that the middle-tier application blocks, but not in
the event loop as it should, but while checking if the socket is ready
for output.

To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

the script returns 0 if the test was successful, non-zero otherwise.
