udp_test sends UDP packets and records round-trip latency.  The client
records the latencies and provides nice summary statistics.  The server
simply echos packets back to the client.

To run:
  1) On server host:
     % ./udp_test -r

  2) On client host:
     % ./udp_test -t -n 1000 <server host>

The -n option specifies the number of samples (packets to send).
Other command line options are available:  ./udp_test -? to
list them.
