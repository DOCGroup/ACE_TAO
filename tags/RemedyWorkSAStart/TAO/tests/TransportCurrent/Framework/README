This test intents to show the usage and the expected behavior of the
Transport Current framework. The topology is the same as in the basic
Hello test: a client invokes a method on the server and then shuts it
down and exits. The special features of the test is that it attempts
to obtain Transport Traits information, using the Transport Current.

There are four basic contexts in which a Transport information can be
requested, by definition:

  * on the client side, outside client-side interceptor;
  * client side, inside an interceptor;
  * server side, inside an up-call;
  * server side, inside an interceptor;

The test implements the client and the server side interceptors that
simply call a test method when invoked. A simple interception count
serves to validate the expected behavior.

By default, the client and server will each have only one thread. Use
"-t N" parameter to override that. The "-n N" client-side parameter
determines how many times a particular client thread will call the
server. The default is 1.
