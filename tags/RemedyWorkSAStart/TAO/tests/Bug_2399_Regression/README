This is a build only test. A failure in the IDL compilation will probably indicate a regression.

The IDL is compiled with a temporary file location specified using the -t parameter. The location is ./mytmp/.

The file included.idl in ./mytmp/. is uncompilable - the test is intended to prove that it is not getting included instead of the correct included.idl (the one in *this* directory).
