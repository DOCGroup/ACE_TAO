The example ThreadPool, ThreadPool2 and ThreadPool3 use the same idl file which
defines some twoway calls and a simple oneway call and they are different just
because of their configurations such as the number of servants, the number of
ORB threads and the number of csd threads.

ThreadPool  - 1 servant, 1 ORB theread (main thread), 1 csd thread.
ThreadPool2 - multiple servants, 1 ORB theread (main thread), multiple
csd threads.
ThreadPool3 - 1 servant, multiple ORB thereads (main thread), multiple
csd threads.

The example 6 is simply a copy of the threadpool example, the only difference
is it uses the TIE approach.

The example ThreadPool4 and ThreadPool5 use the same idl file which includes
the operations defined in example ThreadPool, ThreadPool2 and ThreadPool3 in
addition of callbacks and the oneway "IN" argument test. The ThreadPool4 is
a collocated test. The ThreadPool5 combines all other test cases together except
the ThreadPool6 example.
