## The BlockingPolicy requires the notify service to use the following settings to prevent
## dispatch threads from handling supplier-side requests. This would allow dispatch threads
## to block on the condition variables used for the blocking feature, which would prevent
## the thread from handling the consumer response, resulting in deadlock.
