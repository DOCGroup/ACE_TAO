This is a test for the StateListener when the StateListenerControl is in the MANY_BY_MANY mode.

The test uses the Updater to sent samples.
With a create_one ( 1 sample) and create_many (3 samples) of the Updater,
the on_creation must be triggered ( 4 times 1 sample).

With a delete_one ( 1 sample) and a delete_many (3 samples) of the Updater,
 the on_deletion must betriggered( 4 times 1 sample).

With update_one  ( 1 sample) and update_many (3 samples) of the Updater,
 the on_many_updates must ideal be triggered 2 times (1 and 3 samples),
but it is possible through timing problems that the 3 samples are nor received at one time.

Because of the MANY_BY_MANY mode, the on_one_update must not be triggered,
even if the Updater does a update_one.

In on_deletion, the returning dataum.key is tested . The key shouldn't be empty, but have a valid value
because of the  <serialize_key_with_dispose> and <propagate_dispose_of_unregistered_instances> settings in the QoS .


Beccause the StateListener performs a get, a read_all of a Reader shouldn't receive any samples
after the Statelistener has received his triggers.
