	<h3>Registration of Valuetype Factories for Event Sinks</h3>
		<p>Components with one or more event sink (consumer) ports will need to have a 
			valuetype factory registered with the underlying ORB in order to correctly 
			demarshal the state of eventtypes it receives over the wire.</p>
		<p>For the common case (eventtypes that contain only one or more state members), 
			the IDL compiler generates a concrete class with a name constructed from the 
			valuetype name and an '_init' suffix, and then generates a macro 
			in the servant constructor that registers this factory with the container's 
			ORB. However, an eventtype, like any valuetype, may also contain operation 
			and/or factory declarations. In these cases things are not so simple. For 
			example a factory declaration in an IDL valuetype or eventtype will generate a 
			pure virtual function of the same name in the associated _init class, meaning 
			that ORB factory registration for this type must be with a derived factory 
			class written by the application developer. The table below shows all possible 
			cases of IDL compiler factory generation.</p>
		<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLSPACING="4" CELLPADDING="4" ID="Table1">
			<TR>
				<TD></TD>
				<TD><b>Has Operation</b></TD>
				<TD><b>Has No Operation</b></TD>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Has Factory</b></td>
				<td>ABSTRACT FACTORY</td>
				<td>ABSTRACT FACTORY</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Has No Factory</b></td>
				<td>NO FACTORY</td>
				<td>CONCRETE FACTORY</td>
			</tr>
		</TABLE>
		<p>The IDL compiler will generate a macro to register the factory with the 
			container's ORB only in the case where a concrete factory is generated by the 
			IDL compiler, and thus no subclassing is necessary. There is also a command 
			line option for the IDL compiler, <tt>-Sfr</tt>, 
			that turns off generation of the macro in all cases.</p>
