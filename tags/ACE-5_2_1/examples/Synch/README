This directory currently only contains one example for testing process
semaphores.

proc_sema:
  This test can be used to test out the named process semaphores
support on your platform.  It can be run as either a supplier or a
consumer process.  The available options are:

        -c:     Make us a consumer.
        -s:     Make us a supplier.
        -x:     Remove the semaphore after we're done.
        -n:     Specify the name of the semaphore.
        -i:     Number of acquire/release we'll perform.
        -d:     Delay for # of second before exiting the program

  You can use this test to see how process semaphores work.  For
example, run the program as:

   proc_sema -c -n 10
   proc_sema -s -n 3
   proc_sema -s -n 7
