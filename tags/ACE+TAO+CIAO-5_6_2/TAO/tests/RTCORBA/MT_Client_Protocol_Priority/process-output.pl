# Usage:
# process-output.pl output-filename number-of-iterations priority1 priority2

# This is a Perl script that processes the output of the
# MT_Client_Protocol_Priority test run.

# The following checks are performed:
# 1) There are no errors or excpetion messages.
# 2) Both server and client termination messages are present, i.e.,
#    "Client thrreads finished" and "Server ORB event loop finished".
# 3) Number of times servant is invoked equals 2 * number of
#    iterations (for two threads).
# 4) Number of requests using iiop is equal to the number of requests using
#    shmiop, which is equal to the specified number of iterations.
# 5) Number of requests at priority1 is equal to the number of
#    requests at priority2, which is equal to the specified number of
#    iterations.
