        * FOCUS.pl:
          Removed support for messaging specialization, this abstraction
          has been removed from TAO

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/TP_Reactor.spl:
          Removed specialization of Reactor.inl, the added include
          is not necessary and causes a circular include problem

Tue Nov 14 12:57:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * specializations/Wait_Strategy/Wait_On_Leader_Follower.spl:

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_ST.spl:
        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_MT.spl:

          Reverted the include file in ace/Select_Reactor_T.inl as g++ 4.0
          seems to balk when this is not there. This does not seem to
          happen with g++ 3.2 or later versions

Thu Sep 29 15:57:36 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * FOCUS.pl:
          Changed the script to use $ACE_ROOT enviornment variable to
          compute the paths to the specialization files.

        * specializations/Protocol_Family/iiop.spl:

          Added specialization rules for specializing the pluggable
          protocols implementation in TAO with the IIOP protocol
          implementation.

Mon Aug 29 11:55:32 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_ST.spl:
        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_MT.spl:
        * specializations/Reactor_Family/TP_Reactor.spl:

          Updated the specializations rules for the Reactor specialization
          after the commit by Steve Huston. These have been tested and
          validated with the code in ACE+TAO.

Mon Aug 22 13:28:39 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * FOCUS.pl:
        * Parser/Parser.pm:
        * specializations/Context-Specific-Optimizations/Dispatch-Resolution-Optimitzation.spl:

          Added the specialization that resolves the request processor
          only once and uses the cached request processor to service
          requests on a specific connection for all other requests.

Wed Aug 17 14:59:44 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * FOCUS.pl:

          Added new option for specializing the wait strategy at the
          client side in ACE+TAO

        * Parser/Parser.pm:

          Added support of <copy-from-source> tag that copies source code
          from a source file and inserts it into the destination file
          at a particular hook location.

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_MT.spl:
        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_ST.spl:
        * specializations/Wait_Strategy/Wait_On_Read.spl:
        * specializations/Flushing_Strategy/Leader_Follower_Flushing_Strategy.spl:

          Updated the Reactor specializations, after eliminating the
          Reactor_Timer_Interface from the Reactor implementation. Added
          two specializations for the Wait strategy and the
          Leader_Follower_Flushing strategies. Updated the Messaging
          specialization based on hooks left in the source code.

Mon Aug 15 14:59:28 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Parser/Parser.pm:

          Updated the parser to include the attribute match-line in a
          substitute tag. This matches the entire line as opposed to a
          word which substitutes default behavior is.

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_MT.spl:
        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor_ST.spl:

          Updated the rules to include the match-line attribute to match
          the entire line as opposed to the a single word.

Mon Aug 15 09:07:54 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * specializations/Select_Reactor_ST.spl:
        * specializations/Select_Reactor_MT.spl:
        * specializations/TP_Reactor.spl:

          Updated the specialization rules. In particular, the
          specialization rules have been updated as two separate ST rules
          and MT rules for select reactor ST and select reactor MT.

        * FOCUS.pl:

          Updated the main script to work with these two rules.

Thu Aug 11 16:33:47 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * FOCUS.pl:
        * Parser/Parser.pm:

          Added option to specify the output path where the specialization
          file should be put.

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/TP_Reactor.spl:
          Updated the thread-pool reactor specialization file tags based
          on the generated code.

Thu Aug 11 10:54:06 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * FOCUS.pl:

          Updated specialization entry for Thread Pool reactor.

        * Parser/Parser.pm:

          Updated the Visit_Substitute method with the requirement that it
          match whole words and not parts of a word. For example, this
          problem manifests when one is trying to substitute
          Msg_WFMO_Reactor and WFM_Reactor. Both the strings match for
          WFMO_Reactor, when only the latter should be matching. Corrected
          this issue.

        * specializations/Select_Reactor.spl:
        * specializations/TP_Reactor.spl:

          Updated the tags to be consistent and corrected several typos
          and made sure that the rules in the specializations are actually
          executed.

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

          Most important thing added :-)

Wed Aug 10 15:38:17 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * FOCUS.pl:
          Moved the perl script from the Parser module to the top level
          directory for convenience.

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/TP_Reactor.spl:

          Added a specialization file for specializing TP_Reactor
          implementation.

        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor.spl:

          Updated the specialization file to be in sync with the code
          level comment hooks in the ACE+TAO implementation.

Sun Aug 7 16:15:29 2005 Arvind S. Krishna <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Parser/Parser.pm:

	  Added Visit_Comment visitor to parse and execute <comment>
	  tags. Each comment tag contains a start-hook and an end-hook
	  which can be used to comment blocks of region within the source
	  code.

	* specializations/Protocol_Family/Pluggable_Messaging.spl:

	  A specialization file that completely removes the Pluggable
	  messaging interface and replaces that with the concrete type
	  used.

Thu Aug  4 14:33:42 2005  Arvind Krishna  <arvindkr@arvindkr.qualcomm.com>

	* Parser/Parser.pm:

	  Added diagnostic messages and updated FOCUS perl script to use
	  Getopt command line parsing perl module.

Thu Aug  4 10:57:08 2005  Arvind Krishna  <arvindkr@arvindkr.qualcomm.com>

	* Parser/Parser.pm:
	* Parser/FOCUS.pl:
	  Updated the parser module to include a <module> tag, this is
	  necessary when the specializations have to work across different
	  directories such as ACE and TAO.

Wed Jul 27 15:54:02 PDT 2005 Arvind S. Krishna <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor.spl:
	  Added a couple of specialization tags for reactor specialization.

	* Parser/xml-spl-parser.pm:
	  Parser now capable of executing search, replace, add and comment
	  functionality for specializations.

Tue Jul 26 12:38:00 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * specializations/README:

          Added a evolving README file that describes the rules for
          integrating different specializations into FOCUS.

Tue Jul 26 11:23:51 2005  Arvind S. Krishna  <arvindk@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Parser/Parser.pm:
        * specializations/Reactor_Family/Select_Reactor.spl:

          A simple perl based parser to parse the XML specializations
          defined within the various specialization
          files. Select_Reactor.spl defines the specialization rules for
          effecting the transformations for specializing the Reactor
          framework within ACE.

        * FOCUS:
          Birth of "Feature Oriented Customization of Systems" is a
          research project that aims at customizing semi complete
          applications or frameworks based on features (e.g., type of
          protocol, type of reactor) used in an application. FOCUS was
          born out of research efforts described in the following paper:
          http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/MW-Spl.pdf
