DIOP - UDP Based Pluggable Protocol - Example
=============================================

This example tests the UDP Pluggable Protocol (DIOP) implementation by
sending oneway requests to a server.  The server in turn replies to
the client with the request ID, he got on the invocation. The client
therefore implements the same object to handle replies.

To start the test do the following:

  server -o ior_file -ORBEndpoint diop://:1306

  client -k file://ior_file -ORBEndpoint diop://:1305

or just run the Perl Script

  run_test.pl

To test proper dispatching functionality of requests from several
clients just start several clients in the same way, but with different
ports

The CORBA object implemenation checks the request ID for sequential
ordering. If a request arrives out of order, it will note it - on
client as well as on server side.
