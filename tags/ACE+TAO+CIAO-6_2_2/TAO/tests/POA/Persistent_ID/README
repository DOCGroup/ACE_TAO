This test checks the combination of PERSISTENT & SYSTEM_ID POA
policies.

A servant is registered on the RootPOA. The client tells the server to
create a POA with PERSISTENT & SYSTEM_ID policies.  The server does so
and returns a object created and registered in the child POA using a
system generated id. Before returning the object, the server saves the
system generated id. The client make a call on this new object to make
sure that the new object is valid.

After this the client instructs the server to destroy the child POA.

Then the client instructs the server to recreate the child POA.  The
server does so and returns a object created and registered in the
child POA, but this time uses the previous generated id instead of
using a newly generated one. Before returning the object, the server
saves the system generated id. The client make a call on this new
object and on the previous object to make sure that the objects are
valid.
