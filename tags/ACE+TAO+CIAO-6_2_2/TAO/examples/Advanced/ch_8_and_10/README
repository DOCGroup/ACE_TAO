Chapters 8 and 10 example.
______________________________________________________________________________
This example been taken from the book "Advanced CORBA Programming with C++"
by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski. Copyright 1999. Addison-Wesley, Reading,
MA.  To make the examples work with TAO, some minor modifications to the
source code have been made, with permission, by Mike Moran <mm4@cs.wustl.edu>.
All of these changes are documented in the file CHANGES, in this directory.

Summary:
    This is the most basic version of the climate control system presented
    throughout the book.   The client is presented in chapter 8 and the
    server in chapter 10.

Building:
    This example must be built with native C++ exceptions, and with an ACE/TAO
    build with exceptions.  Make sure to use TAO_FLAG Ge=0 to ensure
    that the IDL generated code uses c++ exceptions rather than creating
    CORBA_Environment variables.

    With GNU make, simply type
     % make exceptions=1
    to create the executable server and client.

server:
    The server takes no parameters nor command line options and returns an
    IOR to stdout.  The server then waits infinitely for clients requests.

client:
    The client takes an IOR from the command line, narrows this to a
    controller reference, makes several remote calls on this controller, and
    finally terminates.

run_test.pl:
    This is currently a UNIX only script!  It starts up the server, redirecting
    stdout to a file, then passes the file's contents to the command line of
    the client.  After the client terminates, the server is killed.
