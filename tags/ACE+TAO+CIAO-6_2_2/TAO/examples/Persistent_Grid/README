This example shows how to store the state of CORBA servants in
persistent memory.  The example is a variation of the Grid example in
$TAO_ROOT/examples/Simple/grid.

The server hosts the Grid servant.  A client sets some values in the
grid.  These values are written out by the server in to a
memory-mapped file, at which point the server shuts down.  A new
server is then started, which reads from the same memory-mapped file.
Another client (named persistent_client) then reads and prints the
values from the locations where the original client stored the values.

server:
-------

server [-d debug] -o <ior_output_file> -m <memory_pool>

Options:
-------
-o    Outputs the ior to the file
      The ior is the reference using which the client can interact with
      the target server object.
-m    Name of the memory pool.


When the server is started, you should see as the first line of output
something that looks like

	iiop:1.0//danzon.cs.wustl.edu:10015/P35ad159600081a38/child_poa/server
	(-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
	(-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

client:
-------

client [-d] [-x] [-f <Server_ior_file>] [-k file://<ior_output_file>]
       [-w] [-h] [-v]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag
-x    Tells the server to shutdown at the end of the test.
-f    Reads the server ior from the file
-k    IOR or The IOR can also be given in the format like file://[file.ior]
      with the full path

-w    Width of the grid
-h    Height of the grid
-v    Value that needs to be the starting point for storage. The value
      that is stored will be this value + location id.

persistent_client:
-----------------
persistent_client [-d] [-x] [-f <Server_ior_file>] [-k file://<ior_output_file>]
       [-w] [-h] [-v]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag
-x    Tells the server to shutdown at the end of the test.
-f    Reads the server ior from the file
-k    IOR or The IOR can also be given in the format like file://[file.ior]
      with the full path

-w    Width of the grid from where the values are to be read
-h    Height of the grid from the where the values are to be read

run_test.pl:
------------

This perl script runs the server then the client. It shuts down the
server and restarts the server. It then starts the persistent_client
to read the values from the memory mapped file.
