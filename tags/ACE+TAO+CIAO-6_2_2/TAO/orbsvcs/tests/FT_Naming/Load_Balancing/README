This program tests the application controlled membership support
of the FT_Naming_Service. The aim is to allow the application
to create object groups and add them to the naming service. When
the client resolves an object group from the naming service, the
load balancing strategy is applied.  Currently the test only supports
the RoundRobin load balancing strategy.
