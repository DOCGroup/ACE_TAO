1 Path : Load vs Throughput experiment with period=0
====================================================

In this test we setup a Path (In a Path, a single supplier sends
events to a consumer and only that consumer) at High Priority.

The consumer performs CPU work according to the load supplied to it.

We increase the load and measure the throughput recorded.


Running the experiment:
======================

Run the "run_all.pl" script in this directory to run the test using RT-Notification.
as "run_all.pl --rt"

If you want to generate results using the CosNotification, run as
"run_all.pl --cos"

To generate the data for both cases run as "run_all.pl --all"

The RT-Notification results are generated in the Load_X/rt_output directory.
The CosNotification results are generated in the Load_X/cos_output directory.

e.g., Load_0/rt_output/c_high.dat would contain the statistics
recorded for the consumer when the Load is 0.


Expected Results:
================

As the load increases the throughput for the consumer should fall.
This helps us determine the load at which the system is operating at
full capacity.
