    <h1>COS Event Channel Configuration</h1>
    </CENTER>

    <H3>Run-time Configuration</H3>

    <P>The new implementation of the COS Event Service uses a
      factory to build all the objects and strategies it requires.
      The factory can be dynamically loaded using ACE Service
      Configurator, this is extremely convenient because the factory
      can also parse options in the Service Configurator script file.
    </P>

    <P>The current implementation provides a default implementation
      for this Factory, this document describes the options used by
      this default implementation.
      Users can define their own implementation, with new ad-hoc
      strategies or with pre-selected strategies.
    </P>

    <H3>The configuration file</H3>

    <P>The COS channel uses the same service configurator
      file that the ORB uses, the default name for this file is
      <CODE>svc.conf</CODE>, but the ORB option
      <CODE>-ORBSvcConf</CODE> can be used to override this.
      The format of the file is described in detail in
      the service configurator documentation, but the relevant section
      for the event channel looks like this:
    </P>

    <P>All the event service factory options start with

      this class takes one mandatory and two optional parameters in

</PRE>

    <P>The <CODE>factory</CODE> is an optional parameter to override
      the default strategy factory used by the event channel,
      the event channel will destroy the factory if the
      <CODE>own_factory</CODE> argument is true.
    </P>

    <P>The <CODE>attributes</CODE> parameter can be used to fine tune
      some of the algorithms and strategies used by the event channel,
      the default values are probably OK for most applications.
      Notice that the attributes include the POA used to activate the
      ConsumerAdmin, SupplierAdmin, ProxyPushConsumer,
      ProxyPushSupplier, ProxyPullConsumer and the ProxyPullSupplier
      objects;
      these POAs must have the <CODE>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</CODE> and the

            In other words, if a consumer calls
            <CODE>disconnect_push_supplier()</CODE> on its proxy the
            EC will invoke <CODE>disconnect_push_consumer()</CODE>
            on the consumer.  A similar thing is done for suppliers.
