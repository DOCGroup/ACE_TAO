    <P>These pages track <A HREF="footprint.shtml">footprint</A>,
      <A HREF="compilation.shtml"> compilation</A> and <A
      HREF="performance.shtml"> performance</A> metrics for ACE+TAO+CIAO.
      The results are collected from our <A
      href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/scoreboard"> nightly</A>
      regression tests.  The complete source for the tests is
      available as part of the ACE+TAO+CIAO <A
      HREF="http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/Download.html"> distribution  
      </A>. The hardware and software configuration used for these
      tests is described <A
      HREF="configuration.shtml">here</A>. Notice, however, that the
      results contained here may be different from what you will
      obtain using a TAO release or beta kit, since the experiments
      are based on our current source tree. </P>

    <P>More information about ACE+TAO+CIAO footprints, and the continuing
      effort to reduce the library and application's code size can be
      found in the

<h3>Additional Development Process Related Pages</h3>
<p>
In addition to the statistics described above, a number of other ACE/TAO/CIAO development process related web pages we use are the following:
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/Coverage/">Code Coverage</a>
</li>
<li>
  <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/Scoreboard/">Automated Builds</a>
</li>
</ul>
The <i>Code Coverage</i> pages illustrate which areas of
ACE+TAO+CIAO code are used, and how frequently.  The <i>Scoreboard</i>
pages contain compile- and link-time build results of recent snapshots
of our main development branch.
