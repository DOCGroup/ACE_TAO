This directory contains a battery of tests that exercise many
capabilities of ACE on the numerous platforms upon which it runs.  In
addition to providing an automated regression testing facility, these
tests also illustrate how to program many of the ACE features.  The
tests can be executed in a single pass via the perl script
run_test.pl.

By default, all the output from the tests will be stored in separate
files in the ./log/ (or .\log\) directory.  However, you can override
this by setting the ACE_TEST_DIR environment variable to another
prefix.

________________________________________

Please follow these directions when adding a new test to
$ACE_ROOT/tests:

1.  Use appropriate ACE_START_TEST and ACE_END_TEST macros in main ()

2.  Add new project entry to the tests.mpc file.

3.  Add test to Makefile. *

4.  Add a new MS project file, e.g., <test>.dsp, then add and entry for 
    it to the tests.dsw file. *

5.  Add test to run_test.lst.

* Steps 3 and 4 will go away once the mpc architecture is fully integrated,
  since the Makefile and project files can be created on-the-fly by mpc.

The tests have been run on a wide range of platforms (e.g., UNIX,
pSOS, VxWorks, LynxOS, Windows NT/2000/95/98/etc.) and they all work
with the following exceptions:

1. UPIPE_Test and SPIPE_Test on Windows 95: these tests don't run on
   Windows 95 since Windows 95 does not support the server side
   functionality of accepting connections from clients using named pipes.

2. Proactor_Test (to be added) on Windows 95: this test does not run on
   Windows 95 since Windows 95 does not support I/O completion ports.

3. Of the tests (believed) relevant to the single threaded port to pSOSim,
   Sigset_Ops_Test, Sock_Connector_Test, Priority_Reactor_Test,
   Process_Strategy_Test, and Service_Config_Test are still failing.
   These are being debugged and will either be corrected or, if there
   are unsupported features in these tests, removed from the test suite for
   pSOSim.

4. The set of tests for pSOSim will be expanded to include those that require
   multiple threads, with the release of the multi-threaded port to pSOSim.

Notes:

1. Each test creates a log file and writes it to the ./log/
   directory. The default log directory can be changed in the test_config.h
   file.

2. Each log file contains a time stamp of when the test began and also
   a time stamp indicating when the test ended. If the ending time stamp
   is missing, you can assume that the test did not succeed.

3. None of the tests require any command line parameters. This is in
   accordance with the keeping the test-suite a "one-button" test. If
   any of the tests require any variable parameters these are
   specified in test_config.h.

4. Time_Service_Test executes the Time Server and Clerk components as
   two processes and so the executable "main" need to be present in
   the netsvcs/servers directory.  Be sure you build
   $ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/lib/ and $ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers before running
   this test.  These components rely on config files. Two sample
   config files are also present in the test-suite, namely
   UNIXserver.conf and UNIXclerk.conf (and for Win32, Win32server.conf
   and Win32clerk.conf).
