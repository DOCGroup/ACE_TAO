<p>ACE has been ported to a large number of <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-versions-i.html">platforms</A>,
using many different compilers over the years.  The <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~doc/">DOC group</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.riverace.com/">Riverace</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com">OCI</A>, and members of the ACE user
community have all contributed ports to make ACE the successful and
far-reaching toolkit it is today.  Any UNIX/POSIX/Windows variation is a
potential target platform for ACE.  If you have <A
HREF="docs/ACE-porting.html">porting questions</A> or have a problem
compiling the ACE source distribution, please contact one of the
commercial support companies, or send a copy of the
PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM to either the <A HREF="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">ACE
Newsgroup</A> or the <A HREF="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ACE
mailing list</A> and someone will try to help you fix the problems.

<p>The responsibility for maintaining ACE across this wide range of
platforms is divided among a few different groups: the DOC group,
Riverace, OCI, and the ACE user community itself.
The table below summarizes each group's role
and where you can get more detailed information.

<p>Although the DOC group has provided outstanding, world-class
support for ACE over the years, ACE's success has greatly increased
the amount of effort required to keep up with its maintenance, answer
users' questions, and give design guidance. Riverace offers
world-class commercial services to support ACE users and OCI offers
similar services for TAO, allowing the DOC group's primary focus to
shift back to their main goal: <EM>research</EM>. The DOC group is
fundamentally focused on (and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/resume-grants.html">funded
by</A>) advanced R&amp;D projects. The group continues to be intimately
involved in ACE+TAO development and maintenance, but with revised
priorities for maintenance. The <A
HREF="docs/ACE-bug-process.html">bug fixing policies</A> followed by
the DOC group are designed to strike a balance between their many <A

projects</A> and their commitment to the ACE+TAO <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-users.html">user
community</A>.  Naturally, we will be happy to accept well-tested
patches from the ACE+TAO user community for any platforms that aren't

  <LI><B>Windows (Windows NT, 2000, XP, 2003, etc., and Windows '9x/ME) </B><P>

      All of ACE has been ported to the Win32 API (which includes
      Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows '95/98/ME) and Win64.  The entire
      release now compiles using the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, and
      7.1 (aka Visual C++ .NET 2003) compilers.  ACE can be built as both
      a static (LIB) and dynamic (DLL) library, using the Win32 installation
      process described below.<P>

      Please see the <A HREF="#Non-static Object Manager">Non-static
      ACE_Object_Manager</A> discussion below.<p>

      We've also added some support for
      <A HREF="#mingw">GNU g++ with MinGW</A>,
      <A HREF="#cygwin">GNU g++ with Cygwin</A>
      <A HREF="#borland">Borland C++ 5.5, Borland C++ Builder 4.0/5.0/6.0
      and Borland C++ BuilderX</A>, and IBM's VisualAge C++ compiler.
      Since we don't have these compilers we rely on the ACE+TAO users
      community to maintain these ports.  Therefore, please send email
      to the ACE mailing list if you run into problems. <P>

  <li><b>Windows CE</b><p>

      Take a look at (<a href="docs/CE-status.txt">CE-status.txt</a>) for
      up-to-date information about ACE on CE.<P>

  <LI><B> Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, and 9 using Sun
      Sun 5.x, Forte 6 and 7, Centerline C++ 2.x, GNU gcc 2.7.x
      and later (except 2.8.x), and KAI C++ 3.3/3.4.</B><P>

      All the source code and tests should build and run without any
      problems on Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, and 9 platforms using the Sun C++
      compilers.

      There are likely to be build problems with older versions or
      different patchlevels of Sun C++.  Likewise, on
      Solaris with g++ you may need to use GNU as instead of
      /usr/ccs/bin/as, if you want -gstabs+ and -pipe support.

      Thanks to Susan Liebeskind &lt;shl@janis.gtri.gatech.edu&gt;
      for providing the following useful information:<p>

      By default, ACE uses both the Solaris and POSIX thread
      interface.  To disable use of the Solaris thread interface, add
      <code>-D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS</code> to the
      <code>CFLAGS</code> in your
      <code>ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code>.
      See the Solaris Intro (3) man page for more information.<p>

      To disable ACE thread support completely, build with the
      <code>threads=0</code> make flag.  See the <a
      href="#flags">Makefile Flags</a> section below for more
      information on make flags.<p>

      If you use g++ or egcs on Solaris 7, you might need to rebuild
      it on a SunOS 5.7 (Solaris 7) host.  Some versions of g++ and
      egcs provide replacements for system header files.  The
      replacements on older SunOS systems are not compatible with the
      SunOS 5.7 system headers.  See <a
      href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~levine/Hints.html">David Levine's
      Hints page</a> for instructions on how to build egcs on a SunOS
      5.7 host, using a g++ or egcs that was built on an older SunOS
      host. <P>

      The Sun/C++ 5.0 compilers has several problems with templates,
      we have worked around most of them but this is not a compiler
      that we test very often.  Hopefully as new patches for the
      compiler show up we will be able to make that our compiler of
      choice on Solaris.</p>

  <LI><B>Sun OS 4.1.x using Centerline C++ 2.x, Sun CC 3.x, and Lucid
      Energize 3.2.</B><P>

      Note that shared libraries do not interact very well with
      Centerline C++ or Sun C++ on SunOS 4.1.x.  This is due to odd
      behavior of the SunOS 4.1.x linker, which (1) does not properly
      call constructors of global objects within shared libraries and
      (2) does not call the init() and fini() functions in shared
      libraries, even though the manual claims that these functions
      are called!  In particular, this means that the tests in the
      directory $ACE_ROOT/tests/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/
      will not work for statically linked services.<P>

      Some versions of SunOS 4.1.x do not contain the
      /usr/lib/libnsl.a library.  This library seems to be optional
      since System V Transport Layer Interface (TLI) support is
      optional on SunOS 4.1.x (in contrast, it's the "preferred"
      transport interface on Solaris).<P>

      The best work-around for now is probably to either add a dummy
      libnsl.a in /lib (which may not be feasible) or simply comment
      out the line:<P>

      LIBS += -lnsl<P>

      in the
      <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU</CODE>
      file.  Naturally, any programs, e.g., the TLI_SAP tests, that
      use the TLI wrappers aren't going to work!<P>

      Note that on SunOS 4.x you may get warnings from the linker that
      "archive has no table of contents; add one using ranlib(1)" for
      certain libraries, e.g., libASX.a, libThreads.a, and libSPIPE.a.
      This occurs since SunOS 4.x does not support these features.<P>

  <LI><B>AIX</B><P>

      ACE has been ported to AIX 4.3 and higher using the IBM C/C++
      Compiler 3.6.6, Visual Age C++ 5 and 6, and g++ 3.2.<p>

      To build ACE on AIX with Visual Age C++ 5 in incremental mode
      (i.e. with the IDE), use the
      $ACE_ROOT/ace/ace.icc configuration along with the appropriate
      version-specific config file (e.g. config-aix-4.3.x.h). All of the
      version-specific config files set the version number macros and
      include the general config-aix-4.x.h file which has support for all
      of the OS versions and compilers supported on AIX. Using the general
      config file is the recommended practice for g++, IBM
      C/C++, and Visual Age C++ batch mode compilers.<p>

      Visual Age C++ 4 has also been supported on ACE 5.1, but is no longer
      supported. If you are still using this compiler, please use the
      $ACE_ROOT/ace/ace-dll.icc configuration file, along with the
      config-aix-4.3.x.h ACE config file. Beware, however, that it hasn't
      been tested.

      BTW, here's a technique from Rob Jordan &lt<A
      HREF="mailto:jordan@hursley.ibm.com">jordan@hursley.ibm.com</A>&gt
      that can reduce the size of the ACE libraries by about one
      third, and can also be applied to applications.  It works by
      optimising the sharing of template functions, which are created
      in an &quot;unusual&quot; way under AIX. It also speeds up
      compilation.<P>

      Here's how to optimise the ACE library generation:<P>

      Look at the <A
      HREF="ace/Makefile">Makefile</a>
      in <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/ace</CODE>. Create a file called
      <CODE>ACE_All_Src.cpp</CODE>, and add a line to #include
      each of the source files
      listed under <CODE>FILES=</CODE> in the Makefile. Create a
      file called <CODE>ACE_All_Tmp.h</CODE>
      and add a line to #include each of the .h files listed under
      <CODE>TEMPLATE_FILES=</CODE> in the Makefile. Now update the Makefile so that
      <CODE>FILES=ACE_All_Src</CODE> and <CODE>TEMPLATE_FILES=ACE_All_Tmp</CODE>.<P>

  <LI><B><a name="Linux">Linux</a></B><P>

      ACE has been ported to <A
      HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cleeland/ace/">Linux</A> on
      Intel, Alpha, and PowerPC platforms.  If you use a RedHat 5.x
      distribution, it's best to use RedHat 5.1 or later.  ACE works
      without any modifications on RedHat 5.1 and later, and on
      Debian 2.1 on both Intel and Alpha.  Use the
      <code>platform_linux.GNU</code> and <code>ace/config-linux.h</code>
      in your platform_macros.GNU and config.h files, respectively.  The same
      files can be used on PowerPC, with LinuxPPC
      1999 (R5), with glibc 2.1.1.<p>

      If you run out of memory, it's easy to add virtual memory on
      Linux.  Please see the <code>mkswap</code> man page.  You'll
      need at least 256 to 300 Mb of virtual memory (RAM + swap) to
      compile all of ACE+TAO.  The <a href="#resource_requirements">System
      Resource Requirements section</a> has some suggestions on how
      to reduce the memory requirement.<p>

      The glibc 2.0 dynamic loader isn't thread safe. If you want to
      use the Invocation API you'll have to set
      <code>LD_BIND_NOW=true</code>. If you want to use
      <code>dlopen</code>, you should use <code>RTLD_NOW</code>.  The
      dynamic loader in glibc 2.1 is thread safe.<p>

      The ACE <code>Tokens_Test</code> hangs with egcs 1.1b on Linux.
      It runs properly when built with egcs 1.0.2 and later.  All other
      ACE tests run properly with these egcs 1.0.2 and later.<p>

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> The TAO NameService uses IP multicasting
      by default, though it is not required.  IP multicast on Linux
      requires the following:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Enable IP multicast in the Linux kernel.  It is enabled in
            the default RedHat 5.1 kernel.  In older distributions, you
            can enable it by rebuilding your kernel with CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
            enabled.<p>
        <li>Enable IP multicast in ACE.  It is enabled by default in
            <code>ace/config-linux-common.h</code>.  If you don't use
            IP multicast, add <code>#define ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST 0</code>
            to your <code>ace/config.h</code> before building ACE.<p>
        <li>There must be a network interface that is up and supports
            multicast.  If you have linuxconf, it's easiest to use that
            to add a network route for multicast (224.0.0.0) on one of
            your network interfaces, such as <code>eth0</code>.  If
            you don't have or use linuxconf, try adding a multicast
            routing table entry using something like this:<p>
            <pre>
             <code># route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0</code>
            </pre><p>
      </ul>

      With RedHat 5.0, you'll need some <a
      href="os-patches/linux-patches.html">updates and possibly some
      patches</a> to get ACE working with LinuxThreads.  Some of the
      patches are necessary with Alpha CPUs and with some older
      kernels.  egcs 1.0.1 can also be used, but it may need patches,
      described there, as well.<p>

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Be careful when installing egcs on RedHat
      systems.  If you don't remove your old gcc and libg++ RPMs, it's
      best to install egcs in a different directory than
      <code>/usr</code>, such as <code>/usr/local</code>, and set your
      <code>PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
      accordingly.<p>

      Some of the ACE tests fail on older, pre-glibc2 Linux platforms,
      such as RedHat 4.2.  The problems are with threads and
      thread-specific storage.<p>

  <LI><B>SCO UNIX</B><P>

      ACE has been ported to SCO UNIX using the GNU g++ 2.7.2
      compiler.  Arturo Montes &lt<A
      HREF="mailto:mitosys@colomsat.net.co">mitosys@colomsat.net.co</A>&gt
      maintains this code.  In addition, he also maintains a version
      of <A HREF="FSU-threads.tar.gz">FSU pthreads</A>.<P>

  <LI><B>SGI IRIX 5.x and 6.x</B><P>

      ACE used to build fine using the SGI C++ and GNU GCC compilers
      for IRIX 5.x.  It has been ported to IRIX 6.x using the SGI
      MipsPro 7.1 C++ compiler; be aware that in IRIX 6.2 there is a
      number of patches that have to be installed and exceptions
      appear to fail with the O32 ABI.  Please check the config files
      for the details.<P>

  <LI><B> HP-UX 10.x and 11.x </B> <P>

      HP sells 2 C++ compilers for HP-UX 10.x and 11.00:

      <UL>
        <LI>HP C++ - this is CC, HP's cfront-based compiler.  As of ACE 4.4, it
            can be used, but some people have problems with templates.
            Caveat emptor.  It's been said that you should run version 10.24,
            if not later. ACE hasn't been tested with this compiler since
            the ACE 5.0 timeframe.

        <LI>HP aC++ - this is aCC, HP's new, ANSI compiler.  It handles ACE
            very well.  You should use version A.01.27 (or higher) on
            HP-UX 10.x and version A.03.37 (or higher) on HP-UX 11.

      </UL>
      <P>
      On HP-UX 10.20, a patch is required to compile ACE. The exact patch
      number depends on the platform - check with HP's patch database to
      locate the exact patch or its successor. For 9000 700 series machines
      it is PHKL_8693 (s700 10.20 sys/time.h fix for select(2)/C++ defects).<p>

      Also see further notes on this platform at Riverace's
      <A HREF="http://www.riverace.com/FAQ/faq.html">Frequently Asked
      Questions</A> page.
      <P>

  <LI><B>OSF/1 3.2 and 4.0 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX 4.0)</B> <P>

      The Digital UNIX C++ 5.4 through 5.7 compilers have problems
      with ACE's templates.  They compile the lib and most of the test
      programs, although they warn about template usage.  Most tests
      run, some dump core.  If you use a 5.x version of cxx, be sure
      to set the CXX_VER variable to CXX_5, either on your make
      command line or in an environment variable.  The ACE Makefiles
      assume by default that the cxx version is 6.x or later.<P>

      CXX 6.0 and 6.1 are much improved over 5.x: V6.0-020, V6.1-025,
      and later build all of ACE cleanly.  All of the tests in
      ACE_wrappers/tests run successfully with CXX 6.0 and CXX 6.1.
      Please note that problems have been reported with some versions
      of CXX 6.1, notably versions -021 and earlier.  It's best to use
      V6.1-022 or later.<p>

      NOTE: if you use Digital UNIX 4.0f or later, you <strong>must</strong>
      use <code>ace/config-tru64.h</code> instead of
      <code>ace/config-osf1-4.0.h</code>.  <code>ace/config-tru64.h</code>
      can be used for all supported compilers on any version of
      Digital UNIX after and include 4.0.  And, with 4.0f and later when
      using Digital CXX, you <strong>must</strong> use

  <li><b> FreeBSD </b><p>

      FreeBSD is a fast evolving platform.  However, it has the
      advantage of having standard releases.  At this moment, ACE is
      only perodically tested against -stable (3.1R) and we rely a lot
      on FreeBSD users' feedbacks.  <p>

      Notice that on older FreeBSD, <code>ld.so</code> only looks for
      so libraries with <b>version number</b> appended.  ACE makefiles
      create symlinks for most shared libraries if
      <code>versioned_so</code> is defined to 1 in
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace</code> with appropriate ACE version.
      However, this does not work for libACE.so itself so you have to
      create it manually (If you figure out how to do this, please let
      us know) like this: <p>

      <code>ln -sf $ACE_ROOT/ace/libACE.so $ACE_ROOT/ace/libACE.so.4.5</code><p>

      On newer FreeBSD (3.0 or later,) this is no longer necessary.<p>

  <li><b>NetBSD</b><p>

      Like older FreeBSD, NetBSD's <code>ld.so</code> also requires
      versioned .so files.<p>

  <li><b>OpenBSD</b><p>

      ACE has been ported to OpenBSD 3.1 and GNU g++ 2.95.3.<P>

      As with FreeBSD and NetBSD, OpenBSD requires versioned .so
      files.  This is currently handled by the build files and no
      additional work is needed.<P>

      ACE has been ported to OpenBSD with and without pthreads
      enabled.  When using pthreads, though, C++ exceptions must be
      disabled.  This is a known problem with the current release of
      OpenBSD (see www.openbsd.org, bug #1750).  ACE emulated
      exceptions work fine.<P>

      Compiling TAO may require the user data segment size
      restrictions and possibly other options to be increased.  This
      is done by modifying the default user class in /etc/login.conf
      or by adding a new class and modifying the master passwer file
      accordingly.<P>

      subsequently did the port for version 2.1.2, also with g++.<P>

      Phil Mesnier &lt<A HREF="mailto:mesnier_p@ociweb.com">
      mesnier_p@ociweb.com</A>&gt updated the port to support

      engelbert.staller@siemens.at</A>&gt
      Building ACE (and TAO) on Unixware 7.1.0 requires a very specific
      g++ build environment.  In particular, you must build and install
      g++ 2.95.2, along with binutils 2.9.1. The order (and the declaration
      of configuration) is extremely important. Using the gcc compiler
      provided on the Skunkware CD on a pentium system, here is the recipe
      I used to build a working environment (as root):<br>
<pre>
  mkdir /usr/local/newgnu
&lt ftp and untar binutils-2.9.1 &gt
&lt ftp and untar gcc-2.95.2 &gt
  mkdir -p build/binutils build/gcc
  cd build/binutils
  ../../binutils-2.9.1/configure i386-sco-sysv4
  gmake  # takes a long time
  gmake install # this creates /usr/local/i386-sco-sysv4/...
  mkdir /usr/local/i486-pc-sysv5/bin
  cd /usr/local/i486-pc-sysv5/bin
  for a in /usr/local/i386-sco-sysv4/bin/*; do ln -s $a .; done
  #links all the newly installed utilities

  cd /usr/local/newgnu/build/gcc
  ../../gcc-2.95.2/configure --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld
  gmake bootstrap # takes a long time
  gmake install
  mkdir /usr/local/i586-UnixWare7.1.0-sysv5/bin
  for a in /usr/local/i386-sco-sysv4/bin/*; do ln -s $a .; done
</pre>
       Once done, ACE and TAO will successfully build and link.<p>

      ACE builds and runs properly on LynxOS 3.0.x, 3.1.x and 4.0.0 for Intel and
      PowerPC targets. LynxOS 2.5.x is no longer supported.

      To build ACE on LynxOS 3.0.x you need to update GCC to
      version 2.9-gnupro-98r2, which can be obtained from
      <A HREF="ftp://ftp.lynuxworks.com/compilers/98r2-preview/">
      ftp://ftp.lynuxworks.com/compilers/98r2-preview/</A><p>

      If you run out of memory on LynxOS, these might help:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Increase the limits in <code>/etc/starttab</code>,
          then logout and login again.  We use these limits:
          <pre>
# Data, stack, and core file limits (in Kbytes)
240000
80000
102400</pre><p>
        <li>Enable or expand virtual memory, with something like:
          <pre>
# mkcontig /swap 320
# prio 17 vmstart /swap</pre>
          See the <code>mkcontig</code> and <code>vmstart</code>
          man pages, and <code>/bin/rc</code>.<p>

      <a href="include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU">ACE
      platform_lynxos.GNU file</a> for information on, and an
      example of, tailoring for your particular platform.<p>

      NOTE: if you want to use IP multicast on LynxOS, be sure to add
      this line to your <code>/net/rc.network</code>, and reboot:<p>

      <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~levine/">David Levine</A>
      &lt<A
      HREF="mailto:levine@cs.wustl.edu">levine@cs.wustl.edu</A>&gt has
      ported ACE to VxWorks 5.2/5.3/5.3.1/5.4 with the GreenHills
      1.8.8/1.8.9 and g++ compilers that are distributed with
      VxWorks/Tornado.  An anonymous contributor has also
      provided <a href="os-patches/vxworks-5.1.txt">notes for using
      ACE with VxWorks 5.1.</a>. It is not possible to use VxWorks 5.4
      and earlier with ACE anymore because the compilers delivered with
      5.4 and earlier don't support the C++ features ACE needs.<P>

      Tornado 2.2/VxWorks 5.5 support IP multicast.  That is not enabled
      by default in ACE for VxWorks, because it probably depends on
      kernel configuration.  To enable it, add
      <code>#define ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST</code> to your
      <code>ace/config.h</code>.<p>

      In addition to all of the other benefits of ACE, it helps work
      around some deficiencies with VxWorks 5.3/5.3.1.  Some of these
      apply only with g++, at least thru version 2.7.2.  That is the
      version that is shipped with Tornado 1.0.1/ VxWorks 5.3.1.  The
      problems are:<P>

      <OL>
        <LI>The program entry point cannot be called &quot;main&quot; with g++.  ACE
            renames it to &quot;ace_main&quot; (configurable via ACE_MAIN) on VxWorks.
            While this may seem trivial, it is important with legacy code.
            ACE itself ran into this problem.<P>

        <LI>argc/argv isn't used with VxWorks entry points.  ACE provides
            a wrapper function that transparently converts shell command
            line arguments to argc/argv form.  See <A HREF="#spa">below</a>
            for details.<P>

        <LI>Unsigned long long support is not available with the g++ that
            is distributed with Tornado 1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1, or with
            GreenHills 1.8.8.  The documentation says that it is supported
            by g++, but try using it :-)   Wind River technical support verified
            that it doesn't work.  ACE provides its own 64-bit unsigned integer
            type, ACE_hrtime_t, so you don't even have to worry about this
            problem if you use it.<P>

        <LI>There a gory problem with munch that is severely aggravated
            by the presence of a static in the Wind River/g++ iostream.h.
            ACE hides this and provides an easy-to-use workaround in the
            very unlikely situation where it becomes a problem.
            Please see ace/config-vxworks5.x.h for more information.<P>
      </OL>

      In addition, as noted <A HREF="#g++">below</A> following the
      discussion of the g++ -fno-implicit-templates option,
      -fno-implicit-templates is broken for x86 targets.  And, -O2
      is not supported on some targets.<P>

      Please note that ACE uses one of the spare fields in the Wind
      River task control block, spare4, for thread- specific storage.
      This field is specified in only one place, in ace/OS.i, so it
      can easily be changed to one of the other spare fields, if
      necessary.<P>

      Versions of ACE from 4.3.3 and beyond destroy dynamically
      allocated singletons in the ACE library.  But, they may not
      properly destroy some static objects.  If you have trouble
      running a program multiple times, it may be necessary to unload
      the module, using unld, and reload it between runs.
      Alternatively, you could try calling <code>cplusDtors</code> and
      then <code>cplusCtors</code> between runs.<P>

  <LI><B>MVS OpenEdition</B> <P>

      All of ACE has been ported to OpenEdition by Chuck Gehr &lt<A
      HREF="mailto:gehr@sweng.stortek.com">gehr@sweng.stortek.com</A>&gt.
      The ACE library, all the tests and most of the examples and apps
      build clean.  There are still some problems that need to be
      ironed out:<P>

      MVS does not support the dynamic linking dl...() calls that the
      Service Configurator uses to dynamically link services at run
      time. As a result, all the examples and apps that use a svc.conf
      file (for dynamically configuring service objects) do not work,
      however, most of these apps can be built/run statically.  Also,
      the Svc_Conf_l.cpp and Svc_Conf_y.cpp files are generated using
      flex and yacc on a ascii (not ebcdic) machine and as a result
      they don't work very well with ebcdic svc.conf files.  We should
      be able to regenerate these files on MVS but MVS doesn't have
      flex.  This is something that needs to be done.<P>

      Some of the tests do not execute properly.  This is a minority
      and over time the goal is to get to 100%.<P>

      The make scheme for some of the apps still doesn't work
      perfectly on MVS.  This is mainly due to the way shared
      libraries are handled on MVS.  See <A HREF="#mvs">additional
      build tips for MVS</A> for more on this.<P>

  <li><strong>QNX Neutrino</strong><p>

      ACE has been ported to <a
      href="http://www.qnx.com/products/os/neutrino.html">QNX Neutrino
      2.0</a>.  We cross-compile for Neutrino on a QNX4 host using g++

<li><strong>QNX RTP</strong><p>

      ACE has been ported to <a

      </a>. We compile for QNX RTP using the GCC compiler shipped with the
      distribution, using the <a

      <strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">WARNING:</font></blink></strong>
      Under the current version of QNX RTP ACE fails if compiled with
      debug=1 (i.e. "-g" option in GCC). <p>


  <li><strong>PharLap TNT Embedded ToolSuite (ETS)</strong><p>

      ACE has been ported to <a
      href="http://www.pharlap.com">PharLap's</a> TNT Embedded
      ToolSuite (ETS) version 9.1. The port is being tested with
      Microsoft Visual C++ 6.<p> To build for PharLap, use the
      ace/config-pharlap.h configuration file, and the instructions
      for building on Windows. Building the ACE library is the same as
      for regular Windows platforms, except you choose one of the PharLap
      ETS configurations to build within Visual C++. Only static
      library configurations are available for PharLap at this time.
      For an example of how to build
      binaries, see the tests directory. The tests_pharlap_msvc.lnk
      file is a LinkLoc commands file that the ACE tests are built
      with. It is likely that local sites may need to adjust this file
      for their target environment.<P>

<li><strong>Mac OS X (10.2.x)</strong><p>

        <p>ACE builds and runs on Mac OS X 10.2.x, but the following are
        needed to build it:</p>

        <p>1. The latest version of the Apple Developer Tools
        (December 2002)</p> 
        <p>2. The dlcompat library (obtained either through Fink or
        SourceForge)</p>

        <p>When creating $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h for Mac OS X, you need
        to add the following if you obtained dlcompat via Fink:</p>

        <p>#define ACE_NEEDS_DL_UNDERSCORE</p>

        <p>You'll also need to do:</p>

        <p>setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$ACE_ROOT/lib</p>
        <p>setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.2</p>

        <p>Currently, all ACE tests pass except Process_Mutex_Test and
        MEM_Stream_Test.  Also, Mac OS X doesn't yet support *nix
        aio_* calls, and ACE does not know anything about Mach.</p>

        <p>The work to port ACE to Mac OS X was done by several people,
        John Zorko

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="g++">Compiling ACE with GNU g++</A></H4>

If you use the GNU GCC g++ compiler please note the following:

<UL>
  <li>If you have problems building shared libraries with egcs 1.1 or 1.1.1
      on SunOS 2.5 or 2.5.1 that look like this:
      <pre>
        /usr/ccs/lib/libgen.a(reg_compile.o): In function `_get_vars_storage':
        reg_compile.o(.text+0x30): relocation truncated to fit: R_SPARC_GOT13 free
      </pre>
      the suggested workaround is to comment out the <code>ACE_HAS_REGEX</code>
      <code>#define</code> in <code>ace/config-sunos5.5.h</code>.
      Or better, create an <code>ace/config.h</code> that looks like:
      <pre>
      #ifndef ACE_CONFIG_H
      // ACE_CONFIG_H is defined by the following #included header.

      #include "ace/config-sunos5.5.h"

      #undef ACE_HAS_REGEX

      #endif /* ACE_CONFIG_H */
      </pre>
      We don't know what causes the link problem, though the
      workaround solves it.<p>

  <li>With g++ 2.8.0, an internal compiler error is raised when
      trying to compile ACE_Map_Manager instantiations.  One workaround
      is to disable optimization.  The easiest way to do that is:

      <pre><code>% make optimize=0</code></pre>

      Or, you can edit your include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU,
      and comment out the <code>OCFLAGS</code> line.<P>

  <li>ACE/TAO don't seem to build well with g++ 2.8.1.  We routinely
      use g++ 2.95.x and g++ 3.x, and recommend those versions or better.<p>

  <LI>Earlier (prior to 2.95.2) versions of g++ may not compile
      certain parts of ACE correctly due to compiler bugs.  Please
      upgrade to g++ 2.95.2 or greater.<P>

  <LI>Make sure to update your gcc <code>config.status</code>
      file.  This file is produced when installing gcc; it specifies
      where to install the binary files that gcc uses.  For example,
      it specifies whether to use Solaris's <code>/usr/ccs/bin</code>
      binary utils or GNU binary utils.  The
      <code>config.status</code> file is an output of the gcc
      <code>configure</code> script; it is preferable to use the
      <code>--prefix</code> option to <code>configure</code> instead
      of hacking its output.<P>

  <LI>If you are getting weird link errors when building libACE
      on Solaris you are probably using the GNU linker.  Try using the
      Sun linker (/usr/ccs/bin/ld) instead.  Note that gcc first looks
      for the GNU linker if it is installed along with gcc.  The only
      way to not use the GNU linker is to delete it from the
      installation or to build your own compiler with no linker.  Be
      aware that you still need the libraries and includes of gcc.<P>

      NOTE: if you do use the GNU linker, you might need to change
      the <code>-G</code> flag to <code>-shared</code> in
      the <code>SOFLAGS</code> definition in your
      <code>include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code>.<p>

  <LI>Don't get too confused about contradictory statements in
      the gcc documentation. It was written by different
      people...<P>

  <LI>Make sure that the linker invoked by gcc produces code
      that initializes static objects.  Please see gcc's
      documentation for using <CODE>collect2</CODE>.<P>

  <LI>On VxWorks only, g++ (thru version 2.9.6, distributed
      with Tornado 2.2/VxWorks 5.5), for x86 targets,
      -fno-implicit-templates is broken.  In addition, -O2
      is not supported on some targets.<P>

<P><HR>
<H4><A NAME="egcs">Compiling ACE with egcs</A></H4>
<ul>
  <li>ACE transparently supports egcs, for the most part.  Please see
      <a href="#g++">Compiling ACE with g++</a> in this document.  And,
      please use the appropriate g++ config and platform files for the OS on
      which you will use egcs.<p>

  <li><strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">WARNING:</font></blink></strong>
      The default behavior of the ACE Makefiles is to enable native
      exception support.  To disable exception handling, add
      <code>exceptions=0</code> to your <code>make</code> command line
      invocation, or to your
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code> file.<p>

  <li>egcs may have trouble linking some executables, such as the ACE
      IOStream_Test, if its static libraries are used.  Though
      <a href="mailto:trose@bridgewatersys.com">Tim Rose</a> reports
      that egcs 1.1.1 static libraries work just fine on Solaris 2.6
      with  patches: 105181-12, 105568-13, 105210-19, 105591-05, 105395-04,
      and 105490-07.<p>

      If you need or want to use egcs' shared libraries, build it
      with the <code>--enable-shared</code> egcs config option.  The
      <code>--enable-shared</code> option is <strong>not</strong> an
      egcs run-time option.  Build egcs in a way similar to the
      following example:
      <pre><code>
         $ ./configure --enable-shared
         $ make bootstrap
      </code></pre>
      Be sure to set your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment
      variable, if necessary, to pick up those shared libraries.<p>

  <li>On DEC Alpha, egcs through version 1.03a, at least, may fail
      to build ACE if debugging (-g) is enabled.  The fix is to
      edit the egcs gcc/mips-file.c file, at line 976, and change
      <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> to 8192.  Then rebuild ACE.  Thanks to
      <a href="mailto:gpai@voicetek.com">Ganesh Pai</a> for this
      information.<p>

   <li>Compiling using the <code>-fsquangle</code> option helps to shorten long
       symbol names and is a boon to linkers and assemblers which cant
       grok long names.

       Thanks to <a href="mailto:ssweeney@sanders.com">Skye Sweeney</a> for trying it
       out and <a href="mailto:ossama@uci.edu">Ossama Othman</a> for discovering the
       option with egcs.<p>

       Heres a note on how to go about this (contributed by Skye
       Sweeney):<p>

       1) -fsquangle  the name is a combination of squash and mangle!<p>

       2) -fsquangle  compresses the mangled names.<p>

       3) All libraries must be compiles with the option. You cannot simply
       compile modules that have large names with it. This includes system
       libraries and vendor libraries like RogueWave.<p>

       4) The "simple" solution is not to add the option to each makefile,
       but rather recompile the compiler to have the option on by default.
       This is done by editing the file `gcc/cp/decl2.c', setting
       `flag_do_squangling = 1', then rebuilding the compiler and
       libraries.<p>

       5) After many false starts and linking snafus, I can recompile my
       ACE/TAO/RogueWave/Lex/Yacc 100 Meg application.<p>

<h4>General Rules</h4>
<UL>
  <li><p>Many features in ACE can be modified by defining some macros in
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h</code>.  These macros should
      <em><b>always</b></em> appear <em><b>before</b></em> including

  <li><p>However, if you want to undefine/redefine macros defined in the
      platform specific config file, these <code>#undef</code> should
      come <em><b>after</b></em> the config file.</p>

As of ACE 5.4, you can choose between two methods of building ACE on
UNIX:
<OL>
  <LI><A HREF="#unix_autoconf">GNU Autoconf</A></LI>
  <LI><A HREF="#unix_traditional">Traditional ACE/GNU Make Configuration</A></LI>

The <A HREF="#win32">build process</A> for Windows is different from both of
the UNIX methods.

<H5><A NAME="unix_autoconf">Building ACE with GNU Autoconf</A></H5>
<P>
GNU Autoconf support has been partially present in a number of ACE versions.
However, ACE 5.4 was the first version that supported it in earnest. There
are still a few problems with this method, so you should be careful to test
the resulting ACE library before using it in your applications. The
traditional configuration method is still more reliable. Any help you can
lend to improve the ACE build process using GNU Autoconf would be very much
appreciated. Please send any fixes to the
<A HREF="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ACE users</A>mailing list.</P>
<P>
The ACE kit has been bootstrapped so you do not need to install the GNU
Autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool) unless you want to participate in
testing and developing this process further. To simply configure and build
ACE, do:

<H5><A NAME="unix_traditional">Using the Traditional ACE/GNU Configuration</A></H5>
<P>
Here's what you need to do to build ACE using GNU Make and ACE's traditional
per-platform configuration method:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Install <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/make/">GNU make</A>
  3.79.1 or greater on your system (available via
      anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu/make/ directory).
      You <EM>must</EM> use GNU make or ACE won't compile.<P>

  <LI>Add an environment variable called ACE_ROOT that contains the
      name of the root of the directory where you keep the ACE wrapper
      source tree.  The ACE recursive Makefile scheme needs this information.
      There are several ways to set the ACE_ROOT variable.  For
      instance, in my .login file for TSCH/CSH I have the following entry:<P>

      <pre><code>
      % setenv ACE_ROOT /home/cs/faculty/schmidt/ACE_wrappers
      </code></pre><P>

      BTW, if you're running BASH or Bourne Shell you'll need to do the following:

      <pre><code>
      % ACE_ROOT=/home/cs/faculty/schmidt/ACE_wrappers; export ACE_ROOT
      </code></pre><P>

      If you're building a number of versions of ACE, however, (e.g., for
      different OS platforms or for different releases of ACE) you might use
      the following approach (again assuming TCSH/CSH):

      <pre><code>
      % setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd
      </code></pre>

  <LI>Create a configuration file, <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h</code>,
      that includes the appropriate platform/compiler-specific
      header configurations from the ACE source directory. For example:
<PRE><CODE>
#include "ace/config-sunos5-sunc++-4.x.h"
</CODE></PRE>
      The platform/compiler-specific configuration file
      contains the #defines that are used throughout ACE to indicate
      which features your system supports. See the
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace/README</code> file for a description of these
      macro settings. If you desire to add some site-specific or build-specific
      changes, you can add them to your config.h file; place them
      <strong>before</strong> the inclusion of the platform-specific
      header file.<P>

      There are config files for most versions of UNIX.  If there
      isn't a version of this file that matches your
      platform/compiler, you'll need to make one.  Please send me
      email if you get it working so I can add it to the master ACE
      release.<P>

  <LI>Create a build configuration file,
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code>,
      that contains the appropriate platform/compiler-specific
      Makefile configurations, e.g.,
<PRE><CODE>
include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU
</CODE></PRE>
      This file contains the compiler and Makefile directives that are
      platform/compiler-specific. If you'd like to add make options, you
      can add them before including the paltform-specific configuration.<P>

  <LI>Note that because ACE builds shared libraries, you'll need to set
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH to whereever you put the binary version of the
      ACE library.  For example, you probably want to do something
      like the following<P>

      <pre><code>
      % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      </code></pre><P>

  <LI>When all this is done, hopefully all you'll need to do is type:<P>

      <pre><code>
      % make
      </code></pre><P>

      at the root of the ACE source tree.  This will build the ACE
      library, tests, the examples, and the sample applications.
      Building the entire ACE release can take a long time and consume
      lots of disk space, however.  Therefore, you might consider
      cd'ing into the <A HREF="ace">$ACE_ROOT/ace/</a> directory and
      running <CODE>make</CODE> there to build just the ACE library.
      As a sanity check, you might also want to build and run the
      automated <A HREF="tests/README">&quot;one-button&quot; tests</A> in <A
      HREF="tests/">$ACE_ROOT/tests/</a>.  Finally, if you're also
      planning on building <A
      HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</A>, you
      should build the <A
      HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/gperf.pdf">gperf</A>
      perfect hash function generator application in <A
      HREF="apps/gperf">$ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf/</A>.<P>

  <LI>If you need to regenerate the Svc_Conf_y.cpp file, you'll need to
      get <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/byacc.tar.gz">Berkeley
      YACC</A>.  However, you should rarely, if ever, need to do this.<P>

<EM>Note concerning MSVC 5.0 and Service Pack 3:</EM> There has been
confusion regarding MSVC 5 and its Service Pack 3.  Some ACE users
have, in the past, had problems with SP3 that were not present in SP2.
Thanks to the diligent efforts of <A
HREF="mailto:fultonb@pcnet1.ascs.aro.allied.com">Bill Fulton</A>, the
mystery appears to be solved.  The key?  (Oh, this is a good one...)
It would appear that there are actually multiple versions of SP3 in
existence.  The earlier ones have the bug, while later ones have it
fixed.  The service pack downloadable from Microsoft's web site as of
June 16, 1998 works fine.  The CD containing SP3, if it has part
number X03-50158 on the disc (the part number on the jacket is
probably different), also works fine.

Note, however, that regardless of the version of SP3, there are some
STL bugs in SP3 which you should get corrected.  Please see <A

Right now there is a SP4 (and hopefully only one of them) which fixes a

We no longer actively support MSVC++ 5.x or earlier.  ACE might work
with these compilers but probably not without a bit of effort. <P>

      use the dynamic libraries, make sure you include ACE_ROOT\lib
      in your PATH whenever you run programs that uses ACE.  Otherwise
      you may experience problems finding ace.dll or aced.dll.<BR>
      <BR>
  <LI>If you are building for Windows NT 4 or later (Windows 2000, XP, etc.)
      then you can start building without anymore changes. If you are building
      on Windows 9x/Me, then you should add the line <BR>
      <BR>
      <CODE>#define ACE_HAS_WINNT4 0</CODE><BR>
      <BR>
      before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h and it
      will turn off some WinNT/Win2K-specific code in ACE.<BR>
      <BR>
  <li>If you want to use the standard C++ headers (iostream, cstdio, ...
      as defined by the C++ Standard Draft 2) that comes with MSVC,
      then add the line: <BR>
      <BR>
      <CODE>#define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY 1</CODE><BR>
      <BR>
      before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h.<BR>
      <br>
  <li>To use ACE with MFC libraries, also add the following to
      your <code>config.h</code> file.  Notice that if you want to
      spawn a new thread with CWinThread, make sure you spawn the
      thread with THR_USE_AFX flag set.<br>
      <br>
      <code>#define ACE_HAS_MFC 1</code><br>
      <br>
      By default, all of the ACE projects use the DLL versions of the
      MSVC run-time libraries.  You can still choose use the static (LIB)
      versions of ACE libraries regardless of run-time libraries.  The
      reason we chose to link only the dynamic run-time library is that
      almost every NT box has these library installed and to save disk
      space.  If you prefer to link MFC as a static library into ACE, you
      can do this by defining <code>ACE_USES_STATIC_MFC</code> in your
      <code>config.h</code> file.  However, if you would like to link
      everything (including the MSVC run-time libraries) statically,
      you'll need to modify the project files in ACE yourself.<p>
  <li>Static version of ACE libraries are build with
      <code>ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS</code><br> defined.  This macro should
      also be used in application projects that link to static ACE
      libraries<BR>
      <BR>
      Optionally you can also add the line <BR>
      <BR>
      <CODE>#define ACE_NO_INLINE</CODE><BR>
      <BR>
      before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h to disable
      inline function and reduce the size of static libraries (and your
      executables.)<BR>
      <BR>
  <li>ACE DLL and LIB naming scheme:<br>
      <br>
      We use the following rules to name the DLL and LIB files in ACE
      when using MSVC.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Library/DLL name&quot; + (Is static library ? &quot;s&quot; :
      &quot;&quot;) + (Is Debugging enable ? &quot;d&quot; : &quot;&quot;)
      + {&quot;.dll&quot;|&quot;.lib&quot;}<br>

<H4><A NAME="vxworks">Building and Installing ACE on VxWorks</A></H4>
For the most part, you should be able to follow the instructions above
to build ACE and applications that use it.  Start with the
<a href="#unix">Unix instructions</a> above to build ACE and the
applications that use it.  Please see below for more information on
<a href="#VxWorks/NT">building ACE on NT hosts for VxWorks targets</a>.<P>

A few notes on VxWorks builds (thanks to
<a href="mailto:Paul_von_Behren@stortek.com">Paul von Behren</a>
for these notes):<p>
<UL>
  <LI>VxWorks builds are done with a cross compiler, i.e., the compiles
      are done on a workstation creating object modules which are
      downloaded and loaded into the VxWorks target system.<p>
  <LI>C++ object modules must be post-processed by a VxWorks
      utility called &quot;munch.&quot;  ACE includes a perl script called
      <A
      HREF="bin/ace_ld">$ACE_ROOT/bin/ace_ld</A>,
      which is called from the Makefiles, replacing
      the traditional <code>ld</code> step.  You must have perl installed
      to use <code>ace_ld</code>.  If perl is not on your path, you'll
      have to set <code>PERL_PATH</code> to the full path (including
      perl.exe), either in your
      <code>$(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code>
      or in your environment.<P>
  <LI>Wind River provides GCC/G++ cross-compilers for the
      supported target platforms.  The executables are named cc&lt;target&gt;
      and g++&lt;target&gt;; for example, ccppc and g++cpp for PowerPC
      targets.<p>
</UL>

You'll have to let ACE know the target type at compile time.  There
are several ways to do this; please see the
<code>$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU</code>
platform file for detailed information.<P>

The VxWorks platform_vxworks*.GNU files are set up so that shared
libraries are not built on VxWorks, by default.  Only static
libraries, with .a extension, are built.  Therefore, it's not
necessary to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on your host
system when building for VxWorks targets.  Please note, however, if
you use TAO on VxWorks that you will need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to find the TAO IDL compiler libraries (installed in the ace
directory) on the host.<P>

With g++, $ACE_ROOT/bin/ace_ld is used to munch object files and
libraries to set up calls to static constructors and destructors.
bin/ace_ld requires perl on the host platform.<P>

These non-default VxWorks kernel configuration <code>#defines</code>
are required with ACE:<P>

<pre>
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS           /* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS /* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */
</pre>

For completeness, here are the non-default <code>#defines</code> that
we used for VxWorks 5.3.1/g++ 2.7.2:

<pre>
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS           /* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS /* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_CONFIGURATION_5_2 /* pre-tornado tools */
#define INCLUDE_DEBUG           /* pre-tornado debugging */
#define INCLUDE_LOADER          /* object module loading */
#define INCLUDE_NET_SYM_TBL     /* load symbol table from network */
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL_SYNC    /* synchronize host and target symbol tables */
#define INCLUDE_NFS             /* nfs package */
#define INCLUDE_PING            /* ping() utility */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */
#define INCLUDE_RDB             /* remote debugging package */
#define INCLUDE_RLOGIN          /* remote login */
#define INCLUDE_RPC             /* rpc package */
#define INCLUDE_SECURITY        /* shell security for network access */
#define INCLUDE_SHELL           /* interactive c-expression interpreter */
#define INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES   /* show routines for system facilities*/
#define INCLUDE_SPY             /* spyLib for task monitoring */
#define INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT  /* execute start-up script */
#define INCLUDE_STAT_SYM_TBL    /* create user-readable error status */
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL         /* symbol table package */
#define INCLUDE_UNLOADER        /* object module unloading */
#define INCLUDE_WINDVIEW        /* WindView command server */
</pre>

Also, automatic construction/destruction of static objects
should be enabled.<p>

If you use TAO, it's also a good idea to increase the
<code>NUM_FILES</code> parameter from its default of 50 to,
say, 1000.<p>

Please note that those VxWorks kernel configuration parameters
are set in the VxWorks configAll.h file.  You must rebuild your
VxWorks kernel after modifying that file.<p>

If you're first getting started with ACE and/or VxWorks, I recommend
just building the ACE library and tests first.  (Some of the ACE
examples, in System_V_IPC, don't build on VxWorks yet.)  Then try
running the tests.  Please see $ACE_ROOT/tests/README for the latest
status of the ACE tests on VxWorks.<P>

Please note that the <code>main</code> entry point is renamed to
<code>ace_main</code> (configurable via ACE_MAIN) on VxWorks with g++,
to comply with its restriction against using <code>main</code>.
In addition, ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER is enabled by default
to cleanly support construction and destruction of static objects.
Please see the <A HREF="#Non-static Object Manager">Non-static
ACE_Object_Manager</A> discussion for the important implication
of this feature.<p>

ACE threads (VxWorks tasks) can be named, for example, by supplying a
non-null argument to the Thread_Manager spawn routines.  However,
names beginning with <code>"==ace_t=="</code> are forbidden because
that prefix is used internally by ACE.<p>

You can spawn a new task to run <code>ace_main</code>, using either
VxWorks <code>sp</code>, or ACE'S <A NAME="spa"><code>spa</code></A>.
<code>spa</code> can be used from the VxWorks shell to pass arguments
to <code>ace_main</code>.  Its usage is:

<pre><code>
spa ace_main, "arg1" [, ...]
</code></pre>

All arguments must be quoted, even numbers.<p>

The ACE <a href="tests/">tests</a> write their output files in a
directory named <code>log/</code>, below the current
(<code>tests</code>) directory.  If you don't have NFS included in
your VxWorks kernel, you can use these steps, provided by
<a href="mailto:clarence_m_weaver@md.northgrum.com">Clarence M. Weaver</a>,
to run the tests and capture their output:<p>
<ol>
  <li>What I did was create a log directory on the boot NT host of my vxworks
    target.<p>
  <li>I copied all the test applications and the run_tests.vxworks script to
    the parent of the log directory.<p>
  <li>Using the target shell not the host shell, I "cd" to the directory
    containing the script and test programs.<p>
  <li>Invoked the script &lt; run_tests.vxworks from this target shell.<p>
</ol>

<a href="mailto:Kirk.Davies@pobox.com">Kirk Davies</a> provided this
approach for running the ACE tests on Tornado II:

<ul>
  <li>Under Tornado II, I set up the Target Server File System (TSFS), and
    the test logs get written to the log subdirectory under that.<p>
  <li>You have to set an environment variable before running the tests:
<pre>
putenv("ACE_TEST_DIR=/tgtsvr")
</pre><p>
</ul>

<h5><a name="VxWorks/SharedLibs">Building Shared Libraries for VxWorks</a>.</h5>

ACE supports shared libraries for VxWorks, but only with the g++
compiler.  To build shared libraries instead of the default static
libraries, added <code>shared_libs=1</code> (<strong>not</strong>
<code>shared_libs_only=1</code>) to either your
<code>ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code> or
your <code>make</code> invocation.  Then, be sure to load the ACE (and
any other) shared library before loading your executable(s).<p>

A shared library for VxWorks uses the same code as for a static
(non-shared) library.  However, calls to static constructors/
destructors are added.  The code in the shared library <strong>must</strong>
be reentrant if you shared it between programs (tasks).  The
ACE library meets this requirement.<p>

Shared libraries reduce build time, executable size, and load
time of the executable.  But, you must manually load the shared
library before loading your executable(s) with a command such as:
<pre><code>
-&gt; ld &lt; libACE.so
</code></pre>
Shared libraries can be unloaded the same way an executable
(module) is unloaded.<p>

<strong>NOTE</strong>: Shared libraries on VxWorks aren't the same as
shared libraries on other operating systems.  In particular, there is
no support for creating copies of writeable global (static) data in
the shared library.  This includes the singleton ACE_Object_Manager
instance pointer.  If you share global data between separate programs,
they may not work properly.  See the discussion of shared code and
reentrancy in the VxWorks' <em>Programmers Guide</em>.<p>

Instead of trying to run separate programs onto a VxWorks target, we
recommend creating just one program, and spawning a thread for each
task.  The TAO IDL_Cubit test <a
href="TAO/performance-tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/collocation_test.cpp">collocation
test</a> is a good example.<p>

<h5><a name="VxWorks/LinkToKernel">Linking ACE and/or TAO Libraries into the VxWorks Kernel</a>.</h5>

It's easy to link your ACE and/or TAO libraries into the VxWorks kernel.
Just build <a href="#VxWorks/SharedLibs">shared versions</a>, but
disable the munch step.  The easiest way to do that is to set the
<code>LD</code> make variable to the name of your linker.  For
example, to build a libACE.so for PowerPC that can be linked into
the kernel:
<pre>
% cd $ACE_ROOT/ace
% make LD=ldppc shared_libs=1
</pre>
After building the shared lib, link it into the kernel by setting
the <code>MACH_EXTRA</code> make variable in the kernel configuration
Makefile.  Then, build the kernel using <code>make exe</code>.<p>

<h5><a name="VxWorks/NT">Building ACE on Tornado/NT hosts for VxWorks targets</a>.</h5>
The following, very useful information was contributed by
<a href="http://people.qualcomm.com/cryan">Chris Ryan</a>
and <a href="mailto:Paul_von_Behren@stortek.com">Paul von Behren</a>.
Please submit corrections, additions, or clarifications to the
the <a href="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ACE mailing list</a>.<p>

<strong>NOTE:</strong>The make (version 3.74) that is provided with
Tornado II cannot be used to build ACE.  Use Cygnus' make (version 3.75)
instead.)<p>

<strong>NOTE:</strong>Optimization is enabled be default in
<a href=include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU>platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU</a>.  However, the compiler that is shipped with Tornado II has
trouble compiling some files with -O2.  To disable optimization
for an individual file, just add <code>optimize=0</code> to your
make invocation when compiling that file.<p>

Using the Cygnus tools, this approach works:
<ul>
  <li>You'll build both your NT and VxWorks executables in the same
    workspace (directory hierarchy).  This works because the NT
    compiler and ACE's Makefiles put their output in different
    directories.<p>
  <li>Set up your
    <code>ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code>
    as usual for VxWorks.  See
    <a href="include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU">the
    g++/VxWorks platform file</a> for more information.<p>
  <li>Create an <code>ACE_wrappers/ace/config.h</code> file that looks
    something like the following.  tao_idl should be built to not support
    native exception handling, because that's not available on VxWorks.
<pre>
#if defined (_MSC_VER)  ||  defined (__BORLANDC__)
# include "ace/config-win32.h"
# undef ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS
#else
# include "ace/config-vxworks.h"
#endif
</pre><p>
   <li>Set your <code>ACE_ROOT</code>, <code>CPP_LOCATION</code>,
     <code>WIND_BASE</code>, and <code>WIND_HOST_TYPE</code> environment
     variables.<p>
   <li>Build for NT, then build for VxWorks.<p>
</ul>

A few additional Windows Notes, from Paul von Behren:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Cygnus has created a Win32 API which is compatible with a
      &quot;generic&quot; Unix environment.  Using this library, they have ported a
      large collection of GNU tools to WinNT/95 - including a port of
      gcc/g++.  See <A href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/</A>
      A related link is <a href="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest/">ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest/</a><p>
  <li>To set up the command-prompt build environemnt, run
      <code>Tornado\host\x86-win32\bin\TorVars.bat</code>.  This is done
      implicitly within the Tornado IDE.<p>
  <li>To run <code>ace_ld</code>, you still need perl installed -
      see <A href="http://www.activestate.com/software/default.htm">http://www.activestate.com/software/default.htm</A>
      for Windows perl.<p>
  <li>The Tornado IDE will use a standard Makefile for project
      builds, but does not have a GUI interface for managing the
      Makefile.  By default, it will use rules from Makefile in the current
      directory and you can configure it to add certain Makefile
      targets to the project.  If you have <code>ACE_ROOT</code> defined
      before starting Tornado, you can specify an ACE Makefile as a Tornado
      target and Tornado will then call make from the menu.<p>
</ul>

And Chris Ryan's instructions for building for VxWorks targets
on Windows NT hosts:

<ol>
  <li>Path setting that seems to be working is:<p>
      <pre>
      /tornado/host/x86-win32/bin:
      /tornado/host/x86-win32/lib/gcc-lib/i386-wrs-vxworks/cygnus-2.7.2-960126:
      /tornado/host/x86-win32/i386-wrs-vxworks/bin:

      /WINNT/system32:
      /WINNT:
      /WINNT/system32/nls/ENGLISH:
      /bin
      </pre>

      Other environment variables:<p>
      <pre>
      WIND_BASE=/tornado
      SHELL=/bin/sh.exe
      TERM=pcbios
      TAO_ROOT=/ace/ACE_wrappers.vxworks/TAO
      CPP_LOCATION=/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin/CL.EXE

      WIND_HOST_TYPE=x86-win32
      ACE_ROOT=/ace/ACE_wrappers.vxworks
      </pre>

  <li><code>/tornado</code> is the root of the Tornado install
      (<code>$WIND_BASE</code>).

  <li><code>/gnuwin32</code> is the root of a Cygnus GNU download and install.

  <li><code>/bin</code> content is:<p>
      <pre>
      aced.dll
      cygwin.dll
      perl.exe
      rm.exe
      sh.exe
      true
      </pre>

      <code>aced.dll</code> is produced in an ACE NT source tree according to
      documented procedure for NT VC++5.0 ACE build.

      <code>cygwin.dll</code> is from the Cygnus GNU software download and install.

  <li>Basically, follow documented procedure for ACE build/install on UNIX
      platform.  Create a <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h</code> that looks
      like:<p>
      <pre>
      #include "config-vxworks5.x.h"
      </pre>

      And create a
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code>
      that looks like:<p>
      <pre>
      WIND_BASE = /tornado
      WIND_HOST_TYPE = x86-win32
      CPU = I80486
      include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU
      </pre>

 <LI>When using cygnus windows GNUTools on WinNT you have to start
 make with "--unix" option, otherwise WinNT shell cmd.exe is responded and
 not sh.exe, i.e.,
 <PRE>
 make --unix static_libs=1
 </PRE>
</ol>

<h5>TAO on NT Tornado host, VxWorks target.</h5>

<ol>
  <li>Build ACE and TAO_IDL in the NT tree as already documented. As
      mentioned above, I put <code>aced.dll</code> in <code>/bin</code>.
      Be sure to build ACE's gperf on NT, in
      <code>ACE_wrappers/apps/gperf/src</code>.<p>

  <li>Build $TAO_ROOT/tao
      <pre>
      CPP_LOCATION=/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin/CL.exe
      cd $TAO_ROOT/tao
      /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/make

      cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
      /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/make

<H3><A NAME="svcsinstall">Building and Installing ACE Network Services</A></H3>

The following explains how to build the ACE <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-netsvcs.html">network services</A> on <A

<P><hr align=left width="50%"><P>
<H4><A NAME="unixsvcs">Building and Installing ACE Network Services on UNIX</A></H4>

Building and installing ACE Network Services on UNIX is relatively
simple (the <A HREF="#win32svcs">process</A> for Win32 is different).
Here's what you need to do:<P>

<OL>

  <LI>Build and install ACE on UNIX as described <A
      HREF="#unix">earlier</A>.  If ACE is built at the root of the ACE
      source tree (and ACE has been ported to your platform, of course) the
      netsvcs static and shared object libraries should be built
      automatically.  In addition, the server driver program
      (<CODE>main</CODE>) contained in <A
      HREF="netsvcs/servers/main.cpp">$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/main.cpp</A>
      should also be compiled and ready to run.<P>

  <LI>Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to where the binary
      version of the ACE netsvcs library.  For example, you probably
      want to do something like the following<P>

      <pre><code>
      % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      </code></pre><P>

  <LI>By default, if the shared object library is built, the services
      are linked into the <CODE>main</CODE> driver program dynamically.
      To specify which services should be linked in and executed, edit the
      <A
      HREF="netsvcs/servers/svc.conf">$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/svc.conf</A>
      file.  During your editing, you should update information (such as the
      default service port numbers) that affects the initialization of
      services in this file.  Refer to the
      <A HREF="ACE-papers.html#config">Service Configurator</A>
      documentation to learn how the configuration file is parsed and
      how the services are dynamically linked and executed.  In
      addition, refer to the <A
      HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-netsvcs.html">Network
      Services</A> documentation to learn more about how to configure
      each network service.<P>

  <LI>If you only want to link the services statically, simply remove
      or rename the svc.conf file.<P>

   version of OpenSSL. Then you must set the environment variable SSL_ROOT
   to the location of your OpenSSL and then build ACE and TAO as normally.

<H3><A NAME="minimum_build">What Do I Need to Build for TAO?</A></H3>
Toshio Hori &lt;toshi@etl.go.jp&gt; provided these suggestions on building
just what's needed for (a subset of) TAO:<p>

I usually make:
<pre>
    $ACE_ROOT/ace,
    $ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf,
    $TAO_ROOT/tao,
    $TAO_ROOT/TAO_IDL, and
    $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
</pre>
and the whole make takes less than an hour on my Solaris 7 for intel,
Pentium-III/550MHz, 256MB memory, 512MB swap machine.  (Top secret: I
renice the 'make' process to the highest priority, -20... ;-)

To save time and space, I set
<pre>
    TAO_ORBSVCS = Naming Time Trader ImplRepo
</pre>
in $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU also.  See
<a href="TAO/docs/configurations.html#orbsvcs">TAO's orbsvcs
library customization instructions</a> for more information.<p>


<HR><P> <H3><A NAME="resource_requirements">System Resource
Requirements</A></H3> The amount of system resources required to build
ACE and TAO varies greatly.  The required system resources are
influenced by OS and compiler platform, build options, and component
configurations.  As a rough guide, the typical peak memory requirement
can be well over 256 MB (notably, for TAO's orbsvcs).  Depending on
your OS and compiler configuration, an <strong>entire</strong> build
of ACE and TAO can use well over 2 MB of disk space.  It's usually not
necessary to build <strong>all</strong> of ACE and TAO, though.<p>

Much less disk space is required for just the libraries.  For example,
see the <a href="docs/ACE-subsets.html#ACE Library Size Breakdown">ACE
library subset sizes</a>.<p>

If you run out of memory when building, you might consider trying
some or all of these suggestions:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable or increase virtual memory.  If you're on a <a
    href="#Linux">Linux</a> or <a href="#LynxOS">LynxOS</a> platform,
    please see the appropriate sections above.<p>
  <li>Disable/enable optimization and/or debugging.  See the
    <a href="#flags">Makefile Flags</a> discussion for information
    on how to do that via ACE's Makefiles.<p>
  <li>If you're using g++, try removing <code>-pipe</code> from
    <code>CFLAGS</code> in your
    <code>include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU</code> file.<p>
  <li>Restrict the components that you build.  For ACE and TAO, see the
    discussion of <code>ACE_COMPONENTS</code> in the
    <a href="docs/ACE-subsets.html">ACE subsets</a> page.  For TAO's
    orbsvcs, see the discussion of <code>TAO_ORBSVCS</code> in
    <a href="TAO/docs/configurations.html#orbsvcs">orbsvcs Library configuration information</a>.<p>

If disk space is a problem, disabling debugging should greatly
reduce object code, and therefore, library size.  This is especially
true with g++.<p>

Toshio Hori &lt;toshi@etl.go.jp&gt; provided these tips for reducing
disk space usage:<p>

To save space on a Unix machine, I usually run
    'find . -name \*.dsw -o -name \*.dsp -o -name \*.bor | xargs rm -f'
in $ACE_ROOT at first after I untar the distribution.  They are
meaningless in my environment (Files named '*.dsw' and '*.dsp' are
used for MSVC++ and files named '*.bor' are for Borland C++
Builder.)<p>

Finally, to save space, may want to run 'make clean' after 'make'.  It
removes generated object files and leaves libraries/executables
intact.  If you want to remove any of the libraries/executables, as
well, try 'make realclean'.<p>

</ul>

<H4><A NAME="Non-static Object Manager">Non-static
ACE_Object_Manager</A></H4> The ACE_Object_Manager can be instantiated
as a static object, can be instantiated on the stack of the main
program thread, or can be explicitly instantiated and destroyed by the
application with <code>ACE::init ()</code> and <code>ACE::fini
()</code>.  The comments in the <a href="ace/Object_Manager.h">header
file, <code>ace/Object_Manager.h</code></a>, as well as Section 1.6.3 in
<a href="http://www.riverace.com/docs">The ACE Programmer's Guide</a>
provide more detail.<P>

<strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">NOTE:</font></blink></strong>
Special requirements are imposed on applications if the
ACE_Object_Manager is instantiated, by ACE, on the stack of the main
thread.  This behavior is selected by defining
<code>ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER</code> in
<code>ace/config.h</code>.  Again, see the ACE Object_Manager <a
href="ace/Object_Manager.h">header file,
<code>ace/Object_Manager.h</code></a> for more information.  One of
these requirements is discussed here, because it is so important.
Please note that <code>ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER</code> is
defined in the distributed ACE <code>config.h</code> headers for
VxWorks and Win32.<p>

The important requirement is that the program <strong>must</strong>
declare its <code>main</code> function with two arguments, even if
they're not used, and with <code>int</code> return type:

<pre><code>
int
main (int, char *[])
</code></pre>

If you don't declare <code>main</code> <strong>exactly</strong> that
way, then you'll see a link error about <code>ace_main_i</code> being
undefined.<p>

Alternatively, this feature can be disabled by commenting out the
#define ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER in the
<code>ace/config.h</code>.  But, that will make repeated testing more
difficult on VxWorks.  And, you'd either have to call static
constructors and destructors manually or unload/load the program
between runs.  On Win32, disabling the feature can possibly lead to
shutdown difficulties.<p>

<strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">WARNING:</font></blink></strong>
<code>ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER</code> assumes that your
<code>main</code> function is named <code>main</code>.  Any violation
of this assumption is at your peril.  If you really need to call your
entry point something other than <code>main</code>, you'll need to
construct and destroy the ACE_Object_Manager.  The best way to do that
is to call <code>ACE::init ()</code> and <code>ACE::fini ()</code>.
Or, see the <code>#define</code> of <code>main (int, char *[])</code>
in <a href="ace/OS.h"><code>ace/OS.h</code></a> to see how ACE does
that for entry points named <code>main</code>.

<H4><A NAME="cloning">Cloning the Source Tree</A></H4>

On UNIX platforms, we typically like to support multiple platform
builds using the same ACE source tree.  This idiom is supported by ACE
using the $ACE_ROOT/bin/create_ace_build script or
$ACE_ROOT/bin/clone.cpp program.

To use build and use the clone program, first make sure there's a file
called platform_macros.GNU that contains the correct platform-specific
Makefile configurations in the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/
directory, as well as making sure there's a $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h
file that includes the desired platform/compiler specific
configuration header.  Then perform the following steps:<P>

<pre>
% cd $ACE_ROOT/bin
% make
% mv clone ~/bin
% rehash
</pre><P>

Then create a ./build subdirectory someplace, e.g., under $ACE_ROOT.
Once this is done, then invoke the top-level Makefile with the
&quot;clone&quot; target, e.g.:<P>

<pre>
% cd $ACE_ROOT
% mkdir build-SunOS5
% cd build-SunOS5
% make -f ../Makefile clone
% setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd
% make
</pre><P>

This will establish a complete tree of links.  In addition, make sure
you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
$ACE_ROOT/ace:$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH on SVR4 UNIX
platforms.<P>

When you do a make in the $ACE_ROOT directory you will be producing
object code that is not stored in the same place as the original
source tree.  This way, you can easily build another platform in a
parallel tree structure.<P>

<B> VERY IMPORTANT! </B><P>

If you use the &quot;clone trick&quot; discussed above, make sure that the
symbolic links are correctly in place before starting the build.  In
particular, if you plan to clone the tree, it is preferable to do so
before you start a build procedure on the original tree.  This is
because the build procedure create object directories (.obj and
.shobj) and the cloning procedure will clone these directories also.
You would end up with links pointing to object files of another
platform.  If you clone the tree after you've done a build on the
original tree, make sure to remove all ".obj", ".shobj" and (any other
files or directories) in all subdirectories before starting the build
on your cloned tree.<P>

Alternatively, the perl script
<code>ACE_wrappers/bin/create_ace_build</code> can be used to create
build trees.  It creates them below <code>ACE_wrappers/build</code>.
It filters out all but the necessary files, so the warning above does
not apply.  See the comments at the top of the script itself for usage
information.

<H4><A NAME="mvs">Additional Build Tips for MVS</A></H4>

For all intents and purpose, MVS OpenEdition (OE) is another flavor of
UNIX, therefore, the instructions under <A HREF="#aceinstall">Building
and Installing ACE on Unix</A> can be used along with the following
additional tips:<P>

You can get a copy of GNU make that has been ported to MVS OpenEdition from
the <A HREF="http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/index.html">IBM OpenEdition web site</A>.
ACE's make scheme generates compile commands that have options and
operands interspersed.  By default, the c89/cc/c++ compiler expects all options to
precede all operands.  To get around this, you must set a special
compiler environment variable (_CXX_CCMODE) to 1 which tells the compiler
to allow options and operands to be interspersed.<P>

Note that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is called LIBPATH
on MVS.<P>

Shared objects are built a little different on MVS than on
other UNIX implementations.  This has been accounted for in the makefiles
that come with ACE   When the linker (via the cxx command) builds the
libACE.so file it will also create a file called libACE.x.  This is a
side-deck file and it must be included in subsequent link edits with
application code.  For more information on this see the C/C++ MVS
Programming Guide.  If you want to build your application statically,
i.e., using libACE.a instead of libACE.so, you can set ACELIB to
ACELIB_STATIC in platform_mvs.GNU.<P>

When the libACE.so file is built (via the MVS pre-linker and binder), you
will get a rc=4 from the pre-linker.  This is ok.  This is due to some
warnings about unresolved references which should get resolved during the
link step.  Note, however, there shouldn't be any unresolved references
from the binder (linkage editor).   You can get pre-link and link maps by
uncommenting the PMAP and LMAP lines in the platform_mvs.GNU file.

<P><hr align=left width="50%"><P>
<H4><A NAME="flags">Makefile Flags</A></H4>

GNU make provides many options to customize its operation.  See its
documentation for more information.  One example is that for multi-cpu
UNIX machines you will be able to build faster if you use:<P>

<pre><code>
% make -j <em>n</em>
</code></pre><p>

which allows parallel compilation. The number <i>n</i> should
typically be the number of CPUs.  It is likely that builds will be
faster even on single-CPU UNIX machines with <code>make -j
2</code>.<P>

ACE further supports the following flags.  They can be enabled either
on the command line, e.g., "make purify=1", or added to your
platform_macros.GNU.  To disable the option, set the flag to null,
e.g., "make debug=".  Some flags support setting to 0 disable, e.g.,
"make debug=0".  debug=1 is enabled in the platform files that are
released with ACE.<P>

Please note that the effects of a flag may be platform specific.
Also, combinations of certain flags may or may not be allowed on
specific platforms, e.g., debug=1 opt=1 is supported by g++ but
not all other C++ compilers.<P>

If you use Purify or Quantify:  purify or quantify <strong>must</strong>
be on your <code>PATH</code>.  By default, ACE puts the Purify/Quantify
caches below <code>/tmp</code>.  To override that, set the
<code>PURE_CACHE_BASE_DIR</code> variable, either in your environment
or on the <code>make</code> make command line, to the destination
directory for your instrumented libraries.<p>

<PRE>
Flag             Description
----             -----------
debug            Enable debugging; see DCFLAGS and DCCFLAGS.
exceptions       Enable exception handling (not supported by all platforms).
include_env      Support old-style ACE_TRY_ENV declarations in methods.
                 This switch is necessary for compiling TAO applications
                 in the native exception configuration that were written
                 for TAO versions before 1.2.2.
                 In TAO 1.2.2, new macros were introduced that supercede
                 the direct ACE_TRY_ENV declarations. These are the
                 ACE_ENV_ARG macros that are defined in ace/CORBA_macros.h
                 and are documented in docs/exceptions.html.
                 This switch only affects the exceptions=1 configuration.
                 It is for backward compatibility only.
                 There will be warnings about unused _ACE_environment_variable
                 parameters when using include_env=1.
                 If possible, do not use it, but instead change your TAO
                 applications to use the ACE_ENV_ARG macros.
fast             Enable -fast option, e.g., with Sun C++.
inline           Enable ACE inlining.  Some platforms enable inlining by
                   default, others do not.
optimize         Enable optimization; see OCFLAGS and OCCFLAGS.
pace             Enable PACE as the underpinnings of ACE_OS.
probe            Enable ACE_Timeprobes.
profile          Enable profiling; see PCFLAGS and PCCFLAGS.
purify           Purify all executables.
quantify         Quantify all executables.
repo             Use GNU template repository (g++ with repo patches and
                   egcs only).
rtti             Enable run-time type identification.  On some platforms,
                   it is enabled by default, so this is ignored.
shared_libs      Build shared libraries. Ignored if static_libs_only is set.
static_libs      Build shared libraries. Ignored if shared_libs_only is set.
shared_libs_only Only build shared libraries.  Ignored if no SHLIBs are
                   specified by the Makefile, as in performance-tests/Misc.
static_libs_only Only build static libraries.
threads          Build with thread support.
xt_reactor       Build the XtReactor.
fl_reactor       Build the FlReactor.
tk_reactor       Build the TkReactor.
qt_reactor       Build the QtReactor.
gtk_reactor      Build the GtkReactor.
ssl              Build with OpenSSL support.
rapi             Build with RAPI
split            Build the library by first splitting up the ACE source
                   to several files, with one object code entity for each
                   source file. This allows an application that is linked
                   with ACE to extract _exactly_ what it needs from the
                   library, resulting in a smaller executable.  Setting this
                   to 1 overrides debug to 0.

Usually, users do not need to be concerned with make targets.
Just enter &quot;make&quot; on the command line to build.  A few notable
targets are listed below.

Target             Description
------             -----------
show_statics       Lists all static objects in object files built for
                     current directory.  Only supported for g++.
show_uninit        Lists all uninitialized in object files built for
                     current directory.  Only supported for g++.
