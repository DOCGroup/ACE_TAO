<P>In a lot of IPC&nbsp;programming, the clients know where the servers
are.&nbsp; A mail client, for instance, has a configuration file that says
where the mail host is.&nbsp; Your web browser has a "location" field that
you type into to give it a destination.

<P>What if you have written a server application and then you execute it
on several systems in your network?&nbsp; All of the instances are probably
more or less equal to the client's point of view, so you don't want to
"configure"&nbsp;the clients to a single server each.&nbsp; Likewise, you
want the ability to add and remove servers at any time so you can't just
give the clients a list to choose from.

<P>So... how do the clients know where the servers are?

<P>Let 'em ask!

<P>Datagrams are great for this.&nbsp; You can toss a datagram out onto
the network and any servers listening at the correct port will* hear it.&nbsp;
Like ACE_SOCK_Stream that we've seen before, you can get the peer address
from a datagram.&nbsp; With that, the server can&nbsp; send a response
back to the client.&nbsp; The client, in turn, can pull the peer address
out and know exactly where the server lives.

<P>In this tutorial we'll develop three applications:&nbsp; a server listening
for datagrams, a client that can send to a known host and a client that
can send to the entire (sub)network.&nbsp; In the next tutorial, we'll
expand on this to make the server a bit more prudish.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>*&nbsp;Actually, the servers <I>might</I> hear the datagram.&nbsp;
Datagrams are rather unreliable.&nbsp; (Sort of like some operating systems
I know.)&nbsp; Still, if the network traffic isn't too bad, they generally
get through.&nbsp; Your clients can always send out more queries if there
aren't any responses in a timely fashion.</FONT>
