$Id$

This directory contains a number of tests to validate that TAO is
functioning correctly.  The individual directories contain READMEs on
how to run the following tests:

        . CDR

          This directory contains several tests for the CDR stream
          class. 

        . DynAny_Test
        
          Tests TAO's DynAny feature, which allows composition and
          decomposition of arbitrarily complex CORBA::Any values at
          runtime, without requiring any compile-time knowledge of the
          IDL. 

	  IDL_Test

	  A collection of the IDL examples that have caused problems
	  in the past for the IDL compiler. Most files need only to
	  build cleanly, except pragma.idl, which generates pragma
	  prefixes. These prefixes are checked for correctness in
	  main.cpp.

        . Multiple_Inheritance

          This test exercises IDL interfaces that inherit from
          multiple interfaces.

        . NestedUpcall

          Tests TAO's nested upcall feature, which allows
          single-threaded clients and servers to perform callbacks on
          each other without deadlocking.

        . OctetSeq

	  Measures the cost of marshaling and demarshaling of
          sequences of octets of different sizes. NOTE: TAO optimizes
	  this so the cost should be constant!

        . Param_Test
 
          Tests all the features of TAO's protocol engine.
