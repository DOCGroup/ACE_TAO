/**
 * @class TAO_Queued_Message
 *
 * @brief Implement an queued message for the outgoing path in the
 *        TAO_Transport class
 *
 * Please read the documentation in the TAO_Transport class to find
 * out more about the design of the outgoing data path.
 *
 * In some configurations TAO needs to maintain a per-connection queue
 * of outgoing messages.  This queue is drained by the pluggable
 * protocols framework, normally under control of the ACE_Reactor, but
 * other configurations are conceivable.  The elements in the queue
 * may may removed early, for example, because the application can
 * specify timeouts for each message, or because the underlying
 * connection is broken.
 *
 * In many cases the message corresponds to some application request,
 * the application may be blocked waiting for the request to be sent,
 * even more importantlyl, the ORB can be configured to use the
 * Leader/Followers strategy, in which case one of the waiting threads
 * can be required to wake up before its message completes
 * each message may contain a 'Sent_Notifier'
 *
 * <H4>NOTE:</H4> The contents of the ACE_Message_Block may have been
 * allocated from TSS storage, in that case we cannot steal them.
 * However, we do not need to perform a deep copy all the time, for
 * example, in a twoway request the sending thread blocks until the
 * data goes out.  The queued message can borrow the memory as it will
 * be deallocated by the sending thread when it finishes.
 * Oneways and asynchronous calls are another story.
 *
 * @todo: Change the ORB to allocate oneway and AMI buffer from global
 *        memory, to avoid the data copy in this path.  What happens
 *        if the there is no queueing?  Can we check that before
 *        allocating the memory?
 *

   * intrusive, i.e. each element in the list contains the pointers
   * for the next and previous element.

   * @todo: We should implement this as a base template, something
   *        like:<BR>

   * public:<BR><BR>
   *   void next (T *);<BR>
