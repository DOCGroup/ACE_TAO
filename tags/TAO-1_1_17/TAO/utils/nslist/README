$Id$

This utility lists the current entries in the Naming Service in a
nicely formatted manner.  To run it, just type 

% nslist [ --ior | --nsior ]

and it'll print the contents of the default "NameService" returned by
resolve_initial_references().  You can select the IOR of this
NameService via the options described in

$TAO_ROOT/docs/Options.html

If invoked as:

% nslist

The contents of the default NameService will be displayed,
including the protocol and endpoint of each object reference.


nslist accepts two other options:

% nslist --ior

will print the contents of the NameService, including the IOR of each
reference entry and the IOR of the NameService itself.

% nslist --nsior

will print *only* the IOR of the NameService itself, with no other text.
This can be used to locate the TAO NameService for non-TAO applications.
