This test checks that simply calling GetSlot works at every
Server side interception point.

This used to trigger the following assert in the send_reply
interception point if the slot had not actually been updated
after the RSC->TSC logical copy that occurs after the
"receive_request_service_contexts" (such as in the
"receive_request" or the actual IDL interface implementation
code) before the logical copy TSC->RSC that then occurs
before the "send_reply" interception point.

send_reply -> get_slot(TSC) -> long (62) SERVER
send_reply -> get_slot(RSC)
ACE_ASSERT: file ...\TAO\tao\PI\PICurrent_Impl.cpp, line 53
assertion failed for 'this->lc_slot_table_ !=
&this->slot_table_'.Aborting...

The test should complete without exceptions or this assert.
