[Please use the PRF form below to submit bug reports, problem
 reports, etc., to the CIAO developers and interested users.
 Send to ciao-users@cs.wustl.edu.  If you are using OCI or PrismTech's
 versions of CIAO do not send bugs to this mailing list, but
 instead contact those companies for support.  Please also send your
 PRF as plain ASCII text, _not_ uuencoded or as an attachment.

 We prefer that all bug reports be submitted through our bug tracking
 system.  See $ACE_ROOT/docs/usage-bugzilla.html for more information
 about how to do this.  If you are unsure as to whether your problem
 is a real bug or not then please submit your question to the mailing
 list using the following form.  Not using the problem report form
 will make it harder or impossible to identify the problem, and in
 many cases we will be unable to help at all.  Also please try to
 browse bugzilla and the ChangeLog files to find out if your problem
 has been solved in a more recent version of CIAO.

 To ensure that you see responses, please do one of the following:

    1) Subscribe to the ciao-users mail list, by sending email with
       contents "subscribe ciao-users" to majordomo@cs.wustl.edu.

    2) Or, monitor the comp.soft-sys.ace newsgroup for responses.

 Replace/remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.

 Please send this form as ASCII text only.  Do _not_ send it as an
 attachment, or as tar'ed, compressed and/or uuencoded text.  And
 limit line lengths to less than 80 characters.

 PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
 Subjects like "CIAO bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!
 Also, do _not_ include the word "help" in the Subject!]

 When including your config.h and platform_macros.GNU files as requested
 below, only include the contents if you use the recommended method of
 including the platform-specific file in your file. If you use a link
 to the platform-specific file, simply state which one - DO NOT include
 an entire platform-specific configuration file in the form.
