# $Id$

This example illustrates the usage of the XtReactor from TAO.  The
server creates a small display dialog and the client displays a dialog
with a start and stop button.  On pressing the start button the server
dialog box starts a stopwatch.  On the pressing the stop the stopwatch
stops. On repressing the start the stopwatch resets and start all over
again.

To run the server and the client simply do the following:

$ server -o foo.ior
$ client -k file://foo.ior

Note: this test only does something useful if the Xtoolkit is enabled
and the executables linked against the following libraries Xm, Xt &
X11.
