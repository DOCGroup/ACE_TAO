<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>In our previous tutorial, we created a datagram listener and a couple
of clients that would send it datagrams.&nbsp; That server would respond
to any datagram sent to the TCP/IP port at which the server was listening.&nbsp;
What we really want to do, however, is to have the server only respond
to clients that meet some criteria.

<P>Why is this important?

<P>Imagine you're writting a distributed system that will have many server
applications.&nbsp; Each of those will probably listen at different (and
well-known)&nbsp;TCP/IP addresses so that clients can find each server
without confusion.&nbsp; However...&nbsp; In a large system you might have
several <I>versions</I> of the same server running at the same time*.&nbsp;
You probably don't want those servers running at different addresses since
that breaks the well-known address requirement.

<P>By creating a datagram listener similar to the last tutorial, a client
can send broadcast datagrams to locate all of the servers listening at
the well-known address.&nbsp;&nbsp; By adding a thin protocol layer into
the datagram contents, the servers can be selective about which clients
they respond to.&nbsp; Thus, if each client sends its version signature
in the broadcast, then the servers can choose to respond only to clients
with matching versions.
<P>
Kirthika's Abstract:
<UL>
Here, the client uses datagrams for discovery of the server in the
subnet and also sends a signature for authentification. The server
decides on replying to the client depending on the signature. The only
changes from the previous tutorial are in the addition of an extra
signature matching portion on the server side and providing timeout
values on the client side which allows the send() and recv() calls to
return on a timeout if the target party fails to respond. 
<P>
This feature of discrimnation depending on the client signature could be
used for security reasons or version confirmation by the server.
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>*Note:&nbsp; I'm making the assumption that your multiple
server versions will be running on different hosts since you can only have
one server listening at the well-known address on a given host.</FONT>
