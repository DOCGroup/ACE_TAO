        This is a test of the Optimized Connection Endpoint Selector.
The OC provides the means to set a connection timeout.

	Instead of a server we use a invalid IOR. The hostname defined in
the IOR has to meet the following criteria:
* It needs to be invalid, else the connection isn't attempted.
* It respond to the connection request.
* Most popular web-sites meet this criteria.

Normally this will result in the client waiting for a TCP timeout. However
in this test we configure a 1300 milliseconds timeout.

        If in future the IOR host starts responding(results in test failure),
please regenerate a valid one using the ../Hello/server.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
