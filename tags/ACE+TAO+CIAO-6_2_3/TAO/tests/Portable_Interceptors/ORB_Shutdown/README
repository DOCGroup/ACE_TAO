This test verifies that the ServerRequestInterceptor::destroy() method
is not called prematurely, e.g. during ORB::shutdown() and before
ending interception points have been called.

See bug report 1642 in our bug tracking system for complete details.

Test output should be similar to the following:

==== Running PortableInterceptor ORB::shutdown() test
test servant: <IOR:010000000...>
