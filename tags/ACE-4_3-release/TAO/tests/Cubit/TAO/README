How to run the cubit example
----------------------------

server:
-------

svr [-d] -OAhost <hostname> [-OAport <portnum>]

Due to some problems, it is necessary to provide the hostname
If you don't use -d, the server will not display the IOR it is using
and so you cannot provide this string to the client. Thus "-d" is
necessary.

client:
-------
clnt [-d] -n <iterations> -O <IOR string displayed by server>
