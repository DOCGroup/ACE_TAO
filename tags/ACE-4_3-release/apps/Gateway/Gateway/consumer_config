# Configuration file for specifying which Consumers will receive
# events from which Suppliers.  For now, the Gateway only allows 
# Consumers to "subscribe" to receive events from particular
# Suppliers.  A more flexible implementation will allow Consumers to
# subscribe to particular types of events, as well.
#
# Here's an explanation of the fields in this file, and how they
# relate to fields in the "proxy_config" file.
#
# 1. Proxy ID -- Each Proxy is given a unique ID that is used
#    in the "consumer_config" file to specify to which Consumers
#    the Event Channel will forward incoming events from Suppliers.
#    The Proxy ID field is the "key" that is used to match up 
#    Consumer subscription requests in this file with Proxy
#    connections in the "proxy_config" file.
#
# 2. Supplier ID -- Currently, this has the same meaning as the 
#    Proxy ID, though a more sophisticated implementation might change
#    this...
#
# 3. Type -- Indicates the type of the event.  Consumers
#    can use this to only subscribe to certain types of events.  This
#    feature is currently not implemented.
#
# 4. Consumers -- Indicates which Consumers will receive events sent
#    from this Proxy/Supplier ID, i.e., Consumers can subscribe to
#    receive events from particular Suppliers.  Note that more than
#    one Consumer can subscribe to the same Supplier event, i.e.,
#    we support logical "multicast" (which is currently implemented
#    using multi-point unicast via TCP/IP).
