 * ast_decl.cc - Implementation of class AST_Decl
 *
 * AST_Decl is the base class for all AST nodes except AST_Expression.
 * AST_Decls have a node type (a value from the enum AST_Decl::NodeType)
 * a name (a UTL_ScopedName) and a list of pragmas (a UTL_StrList).
 * Additionally AST_Decl nodes record the scope of definition, the
 * file name in which they were defined, the line on which they were
 * defined in that file, and a boolean denoting whether this is the
 * main file or an #include'd file.
