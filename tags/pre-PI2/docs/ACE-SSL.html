<H3>What is ACE+SSL?</H3>
<p>ACE plus SSL is an addition to the core classes which allow the use of the Secure Socket Layer
with the ACE framework. The following are the core classes conditionally compiled in when you run
<code>make ssl=1</code>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ACE_SSL contains the interface to the ssl library OpenSSL.
	<li>ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream uses an interface and behavior nearly identical to
		ACE_SOCK_Stream, only with the additional ssl layer functionality.
	<li>ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor/Connector are again similar to their ACE_SOCK counterparts
</ul>

<p>The ssl library we use is OpenSSL which is available at
<A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">www.openssl.org</A>. This library must be
installed in order to use ACE+SSL. We cannot answer all of the questions you may have about
OpenSSL, but hopefully through using the ACE+SSL interface your questions will be reduced.</p>

<H3>What is the status of ACE+SSL</H3>
<p>ACE+SSL is currently still in early development. If forced to name names, I would call the core
functionality beta, while the interface and niceties are still in an alpha stage of development.</p>

<H3>How do I get ACE+SSL?</H3>
<p>Currently we are investigating the implications of US cryptographic export restrictions
on the ACE+SSL distribution. Until this is ironed out, the only way to get the distribution
is to join the mailing list ace-ssl-users, or contact me with some reasonable proof you
are in the US. Reasonable proof includes sending me mail from domains only in the US. Examples
include .edu s in the US, or ISP which are only in the US. Hotmail accounts won't work:).</p>

<H3>How do I join ace-ssl-users?</H3>
<p>Ace-ssl-users is a majordomo mailing list, ace-ssl-users@cs.wustl.edu. We will be
discussing and distributing code on the list, so again it must for now be restricted to members
from the US only. Any subscriptions will be forwarded to me for approval, so if it is not obvious
your email is from the US, send some proof to me,
<A HREF="mailto:jwh1@cs.wustl.edu">jwh1@cs.wustl.edu</A>, so that I may verify your locality.</p>

<H3>When will this restrictive export policy change?</H3>
<p>If you are talking about the US export policy, I don't know, hopefully as soon as possible. If you
are asking when the Doc Group's policy will change, our lawyers are looking in to the situation now,
so hopefully we will have a better position soon. Our current restrictive policy is only temporary,
I don't think anyone here would be happy if this module couldn't be as open as the rest of the project
is. I apologize to everyone inconvenienced by this. Look for announcements on ace-users when we know
what the final word will be.</p>
