 *
 * @brief Receives UDP and Multicast messages.
 *
 * @todo Update class documentation below.
 *
 *       5)  Make status array size and purge_count configurable.
 *
 * This class receives UDP and Multicast message fragments, assembles
 * them (described in detail below), and passes complete messages
 * in the form of cdr streams to the calling classes.
 *
 * This class is used by various Gateway classes (Senders/Receivers)
 * responsible for federating Event Channels with UDP/Mcast.
 *
 * = REASSEMBLY
 * Fragmentation is described in ECG_CDR_Message_Sender.h
 * Whenever an incomplete fragment is received (one with
 * fragment_count > 1) we allocate an entry for the message in an
 * map indexed by (host,port,request_id).  The entry contains the
 * buffer, a bit vector to keep track of the fragments received
 * so far, and a timeout counter.  This timeout counter is set to
 * 0 on each (new) fragment arrival, and incremented on a regular
 * basis.  If the counter reaches a maximum value the message is
 * dropped.
 * Once all the fragments have been received the message is sent
 * up to the calling classes, and the memory reclaimed.
