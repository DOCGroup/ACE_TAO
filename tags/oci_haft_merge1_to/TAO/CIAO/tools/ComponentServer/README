This directory contains the ComponentServer implementation and a
simple test program called ComponentServer_test_client.

ComponentServer supports the following command line flags:

  * -n : Do not try to call back ServerActivator.  This is only useful
         when testing the server and the server is not created by a
         ServerActivator.

  * -o <filename> : Specify the filename ComponentServer will write
                    IOR to.  This is only useful when debugging also.

  * -d <IOR> : Specify the IOR to the ServerActivator.
