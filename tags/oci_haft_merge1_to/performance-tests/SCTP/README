This directory provides programs that measure the round trip latency
of synchronous octet messaging using ACE wrapper-facades for the SCTP
protocol. Currently these programs provide the only example code on
how to use ACE's wrapper-facades for SCTP. In the future additonal
code will be placed in the ACE_wrappers/examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP
directory.

SOCK_STREAM_clt and SOCK_STREAM_srv use the SOCK_STREAM service
provided by SCTP via ACE's SOCK_Connector, SOCK_Stream,
SOCK_Association wrapper-facade classes. 

SOCK_SEQPACK_clt and SOCK_SEQPACK_srv use the SOCK_SEQPACKET service
provided by SCTP via ACE's SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector,
SOCK_SEQPACK_Association and SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor wrapper-facade
classes.

Additional information can be found in the following README files also
located in this directory.

 README.SCTP - Brief description of the major features and benefits
               SCTP protocol and references for further information.

 README.SCTP_in_ACE - Description of the wrapper-facade classes that
                      ACE provides to use SCTP, general usage
                      guidance, release notes, technical point of
                      contact information.

 README.SCTP_PERF_TEST - Detailed description on how to use the
                         performance tests and the run_spectrum.pl
                         script contained in this directory.

                         results obtained by LM ATL. 

 THANKS - Documents all the people who contributed to the development
          of the ACE wrapper-facades for SCTP and the SCIOP (SCTP
          Inter-ORB Protocol) for TAO. Information on that can be
          found in ACE_wrappers/TAO/tao/Strategies/README.SCIOP
