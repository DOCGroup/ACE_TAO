This directory contains an application that tests all the parameter
passing conventions in CORBA for a number of OMG IDL data types.

Type "make" to make the application. The server executable is called
"server" and the client executable is called "client".

You should have the TAO IDL compiler and the TAO library installed
before using this application.

To run the server, type

   server [arguments to ORB_init] [-d] [-o <ior_output_file>]

          arguments to ORB_init start with the letters -ORB. Please
          see TAO documentattion on all the supported arguments

          -d for debugging. 
	  -o <ior_output_file> for outputting the servant IOR to a file.

To run the client, type

   client [arguments to ORB_init] [options for this application]

   Supported options are:

   [-d]                                 debugging
   [-n loopcount]                       number of times to run the test
   [-f servant-IOR-file]		reads the servant-IOR from the specified file.
   [-k Param_Test-obj-ref-key]          object key of Param_Test object
   [-h hostname]                        host to bind to
   [-p port]                            port number of server
   [-i invocation (sii/dii)]            default is static invocation
                                        interface. To use DII, type
                                        -i dii
   [-t data type]
       Data types supported in this version are:

       short                for shorts
       ubstring             for unbounded string
       bdstring             for bounded string
       fixed_struct         for fixed sized structs
       strseq         	    for sequences of strings
       bounded_strseq       for bounded sequences of strings
       var_struct           for variable structs
       nested_struct        for nested structs
       struct_seq           for sequences of structs
       bounded_struct_seq   for bounded sequences of structs
       any                  for Any
       objref               for object references
       objref_sequence      for sequences object references
       any_sequence         for sequences of Any
       short_sequence       for sequences of shorts
       long_sequence        for sequences of shorts
       bounded_short_sequence for bounded sequences of shorts
       bounded_long_sequence  for bounded sequences of shorts


	There are 2 options of giving the Param_obj-ref-key i.e IOR to the client:

	1. Using the -f option to read the IOR from a file.

	2. Using the -k option to read the IOR from the 	
	   command line.

run_test:
--------
	There is a shell script in this directory named run_test to test all
	the types for sii invocation. It starts the server first and then runs
	the client with the different data type parameters.
