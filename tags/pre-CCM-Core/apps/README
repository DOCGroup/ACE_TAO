The subdirectories in this directory provide a number of complete
applications that utilize the ACE features.

        . drwho - This provides a "Distributed RWHO (drwho)" utility
          that gets around certain rwho limitations, adds
          functionality, and also prints a much prettier listing of
          who's logged in around a network. 

	. Gateway -- Implements a connection-oriented application-level
	  gateway that uses source-based and destination-based routing
	  of messages between peers connected via TCP/IP networks.
	
	. gperf -- The GNU perfect hash function generator.  This
          has now been integrated into the TAO IDL compiler, where
          it is used for generating the lookup function for operation
          names associated with IDL interfaces.

	. JAWS -- This is a high-performance HTTP Web server written
	  with ACE.  It illustrates a number of sophisticated ACE
	  concurrency and event demultiplexing strategies.

	. Orbix-Examples -- Implements several applications that
	  integrate ACE and Orbix (which is IONA's implementation of
	  CORBA).  By default, these aren't compiled since most
	  platforms don't have Orbix.  These examples are completely
	  unsupported and may not work...
