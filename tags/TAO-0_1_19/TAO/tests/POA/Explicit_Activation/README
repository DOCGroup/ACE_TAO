!!!!!!!!!!!!   BUG   !!!!!!!!!!!

This application demostrates various operations that can be used for
explicit activation of Servant objects.

The server program is available here. Use the Generic_Servant/client
program to test this.

Run the server as follows:

% ./server -ORBobjrefstyle URL &


Run the client as follows:

% cd $TAO_ROOT/tests/POA/Generic_Servant
% ./client -k <IOR>


Comments : 
=========

 - As soon as, the server prints out the IOR, cut it and use it for
running the client.
