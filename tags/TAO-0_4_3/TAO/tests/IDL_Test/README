This test is a collection of IDL files that once caused IDL compiler
or C++ compiler errors, plus a dummy main.cpp for the build. There is
no execution check in this test, the only outcome of interest being
the build. The examples in the IDL files come from many sources - some
are made from scratch, some are adapted from other tests, and some are
adapted from examples sent in by ACE and/or TAO users. To all of these
last, many thanks for your help in digging out these bugs!

Each IDL file contains examples that are related, either by the IDL
type involved or by the context in which the error occurs. As new bugs
are uncovered and fixed, new examples will be added to the suite, to
ensure that the bugs do not recur.

To build the test files, type 'make' at the command line. The TAO IDL
compiler will open each IDL file in the directory and generate code
that will then be compiled by the C++ compiler on your platform.

To run the test, type 'main' at the command line.  A message will be
output saying that the build had no errors. To test the client/server
functionality of the various IDL types and operations, see the test
suite in ACE_wrappers/TAO/tests/Param_Test.

The generated code from reopened_modules.idl is not included in the
Makefile per se. Platforms without namespaces cannot handle
reopened modules, so reopened_modulesC.cpp and reopened_modulesS.cpp
have been conditionally included in a file called namespace_check.cpp.
