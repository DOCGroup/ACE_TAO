	A performance test for Callback objects.

	This test measures roundtrip delays for a callback object,
i.e. the "client" creates a Callback interface, then it passes the
interface to the "server".  The client then proceeds to make multiple
requests to the server, on each request the server make an invocation
on the callback object.
	In short this is very similar to what event services do, and
it can be used to compare ORB vs. event service performance, as well
as to fine-tune the ORB configuration for this scenario.

	Run using:

$ ./server -o test.ior
$ ./client -i 1000 -k file://test.ior
