This is an extension of the Load_Balancing_Service example in
$TAO_ROOT/examples/Load_Balancing. The aim of this example is to
preserve the state of the service.  THe functionality is not much
diferent from that of the normal Load_Balancing_Service. 

Usage:
-----
The service is started as follows

$./load_balancer -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:10016 -o filename

The server is started as follows

$./server -i file://filename -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:10007

and the client is started as follows

$./client -i file://filename [-r]

Now, the user can kill the service & restart the service. After
reinvocation of the service, if the client is started again, it
resolves the client works fine. 

PS:
The code contains some MACROS like DOORS_MEASURE_STATS. They have been
added for the performance measurements that were performed on this
application.
