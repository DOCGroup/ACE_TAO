//
// = DESCRIPTION
//    The <ACE_TP_Reactor> (aka, Thread Pool Reactor) uses the
//    Leader/Followers pattern to demultiplex events among a pool of
//    threads.  When using a thread pool reactor, an application
//    pre-spawns a _fixed_ number of threads.  When these threads
//    invoke the <ACE_TP_Reactor>'s <handle_events> method, one thread
//    will become the leader and wait for an event.  The other
//    follower threads will queue up waiting for their turn to become
//    the leader.  When an event occurs, the leader will pick a
//    follower to become the leader and go on to handle the event.
//    The consequence of using <ACE_TP_Reactor> is the amortization of
//    the costs used to creating threads.  The context switching cost
//    will also reduce.  More over, the total resources used by
//    threads are bounded because there are a fixed number of threads.

  // = TITLE
  //     Specialization of Select Reactor to support thread-pool based
  //     event dispatching.
  //
  // = DESCRIPTION
  //     One of the short comings of the Select_Reactor in ACE is that
  //     it did not support a thread pool based event dispatching
  //     model, similar to the one in WFMO_Reactor.  In
  //     Select_Reactor, only thread can be blocked in <handle_events>
  //     at any given time.
  //
  //     A new Reactor has been added to ACE that removes this
  //     short-coming.  TP_Reactor is a specialization of Select
  //     Reactor to support thread-pool based event dispatching. This
  //     Reactor takes advantage of the fact that events reported by
  //     <select> are persistent if not acted upon immediately.  It
  //     works by remembering the event handler that just got
  //     activated, releasing the internal lock (so that some other
  //     thread can start waiting in the event loop) and then
  //     dispatching the event handler outside the context of the
  //     Reactor lock.
  //
  //     This Reactor is best suited for situations when the callbacks
  //     to event handlers can take arbitrarily long and/or a number
  //     of threads are available to run the event loops.
  //
  //     Note that callback code in Event Handlers
  //     (e.g. Event_Handler::handle_input) does not have to be
  //     modified or made thread-safe for this Reactor.  This is
  //     because an activated Event Handler is suspended in the
  //     Reactor before the upcall is made and resumed after the
  //     upcall completes.  Therefore, one Event Handler cannot be
  //     called by multiple threads simultaneously.
