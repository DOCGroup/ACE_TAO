The following tests of TAO are provided in this directory.  The
individual directories contain READMEs on how to run the following
tests:

        . Cubit

          Many tests for various ORBs where the servant returns the
          cube of the number sent to it by the client.

        . Demux_test  (*NOTE* This is still under development)

          This tests various demultiplexing strategies used in TAO.

        . Multiple_Inheritance

          This test exercises IDL interfaces that inherit from
          multiple interfaces.

        . NestedUpcall

          Tests TAO's nested upcall feature, which allows
          single-threaded clients and servers to perform callbacks on
          each other without deadlocking.

        . OctetSeq

	  Measures the cost of marshaling and demarshaling of
          sequences of octets of different sizes. NOTE: TAO optimizes
	  this so the cost should be constant!

        . Param_Test
 
          Tests all the features of TAO's protocol engine.

        . POA

          Contains various small tests of POA features based on
          examples in the OMG POA specification.

        . Quoter
        
          Tests the use of the Global POA options with multiple threads.
                      
        . Simple
          
          Contains a number of very simple tests, which also
          illustrate how to write canonical Orbix/VisiBroker/OmniORB
          examples in TAO using standard CORBA features rather than
          proprietary ORB features.

        . Thruput

          Throughput tests for TAO, based on TTCP.
