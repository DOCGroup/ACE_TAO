Make sure to update the environment variable CLASSPATH to include the
path to where java/classes/ is located. The Java compiler uses this to
find classes when resolving dependencies.

The Makefile has been worked over severely, and it now REQUIRES GNU
Make.  The makefile is still a little rough, and will definitely
evolve.

Suggestions are welcome at cleeland@cs.wustl.edu or pjain@cs.wustl.edu.

Also, TimeValue moved from the ACE.Reactor to ACE.ASX package to break
up some circular dependency problems.

The documentation for Java ACE has not been included in the release
but can be automatically generated by typing "make doc" in the src
directory. Note that the gif images needed by the documentaion ARE
included in the release.
