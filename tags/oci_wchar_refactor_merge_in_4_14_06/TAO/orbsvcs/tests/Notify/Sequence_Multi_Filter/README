Sequence Event Filter Test
============================


Description
-----------

This test checks push supplier and push consumer event filter mechanisms.
The supplier sends a number of events specified by the consumer. The consumer 
can filter or not filter the events and can use multiple consumers.
The consumer may specify 'and' and/or 'or' relations on the filterable data
contained within an event.


Usage
-----

The test consists of a Supplier and Consumer. The usage for each as is
follows:

$ ./Sequence_Supplier -\?
usage:  ./Sequence_Supplier -ORBInitRef <Naming Service Location> 

$ ./Sequence_Consumer -\?
usage:  ./Sequence_Consumer -l <low> -h high -d <discard policy> -c <constraint string>

The "low" value specified the number of whole batches of events expected.  The "high" value specifies the total number of batches of events expected, including any partial batches.

The "constraint string" allows the TCL filter string to be specified on the command line.

To run this test, run the run_test.pl perl script. 
This script is designed to test various aspects of the filtering
mechanism.


Expected Results
----------------
The test script will display an error if for any test that fails. 
Otherwise, the test passed.
