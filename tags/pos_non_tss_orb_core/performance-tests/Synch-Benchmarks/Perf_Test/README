The files in this directory support controlled benchmarking of the ACE
synchronization mechanisms.

  These mechanisms include:

	. Mutexes
	. Reader/writer locks
	. Condition variables
	. Semaphores
        . Tokens
        . Adaptive lockings

There are additional tests that measure the memory bandwidth under the
following conditions:

	. User memory-to-memory copying of data within a single thread
 	. User memory-to-kernel-to-user memory copying via pipes
	  between separate processes, as well as between separate
	  threads in the same process

There are many options available for this module that can be put into
svc.conf files.  See the Performance_Test_Options.[Chi] file for more
details.  Some reasonable options to use to run the tests are:

 -v -B -s 15
 -v -n 4 -t 4 -s 15

You should experiment with other options as you see fit.  Note that on
Solaris, you should always make sure that you have more than 1 LWP (by
using either the -B or the -n options) since otherwise the program may
get into an infinite loop due to the semantics of SunOS unbound
threads... (This may no longer be the case.)
