This directory contains code that has a modified version of the TTCP benchmark that uses
Orbix. Our intent is to test the performance of Orbix over ATM using the CORBA IDL "sequence"
data type.

We define sequences of "short", "long", "double", "octet", "char", a user-defined
"struct" and a composite struct.

We run our server program using the following command line: (this is
an example)

putit SII_ttcp "/project/mambo/gokhale/TTCP-testbed/SII/1way/Orbix/server -f m -b 65536"

The client program is run using the following command line:
client -S <data size> -f m -l <chunk size> -h <host> -L <filename> -q <data type> -b <socketQ>

<data type> implies what sequence type you want to send:
s	short
c	chars
o	octet
d	double
l	long
S	user defined struct
C	composite struct
<filename> will store the result that indicates the thruput observed in Mbps (because
we chose -f m as the option).

An example is given from the "run" script

client -S 67108864 -f m -l $1 -h encip1-merengue.cs.wustl.edu -L temp -q $2 -b 65536


The following files are used:

Client.cpp	Client program.
ttcp_i.cpp	Implementation of various methods of the ttcp_sequence object.
ttcp_i.h	Implementation header
utils.cpp	Lots of functions that came along with the original TTCP benchmark.
ttcp_decl.h	Prototypes, extern decls, etc...
