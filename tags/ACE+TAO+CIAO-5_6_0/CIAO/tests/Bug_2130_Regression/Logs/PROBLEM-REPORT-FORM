    SYNOPSIS:
      A call of Session_Container::get_objref blocks forever.

    DESCRIPTION:
      I'm running two clients simultaneously callings the methods acquireSession
      and releaseSession of the CORBA component TSEC_CheckPoint ( please see
      sample code in TSEC_CheckPoint_exec.cpp lines 233... and 283... and also 
      controller.cpp line 150... ) configured with realtime policies. After the 
      start of the second client the component TSEC_CheckPoint blocks in the 
      method Session_Container::get_objref ( please see the log file 
      DebuggerCallStack.log ).   

      The serious code line of TSEC_CheckPoint_exec.cpp is:
        CORBA::Object_var obj = this->getObjRef( p_sessionImpl) ;
      
      If only one client is calling acquireSession every thing works fine. 
      But if I start a second client which is calling acquireSession then the 
      block happens.  

      I'm using the patch from 20051612 for the files 
      Container_Base.cpp and Container_Base.h which I merge with the CIAO 
      version 047. 
      
      If i use CIAO version < 043 everythings works fine with no blocks.
       
    REPEAT BY:
      Please build the sample code:
      - cd interfaces
      - mwc.pl -type nmake
      - nmake realclean clean depend all
      - touch *.idl
      - nmake 
      - cd SEC_CheckPoint
      - mwc.pl -type nmake
      - nmake realclean clean depend all 
      
      Please run the sample:
      - cd descriptors
      - start_da.bat
      - start_am.bat
      - start_test.bat
      - start_testcase_1.bat
      - start_testcase_2.bat
