Description:

This is a test for the Linear Priority mapping in TAO.  In addition,
this test combines and tests several RT policies in different ways.
This test can also be used for testing the different scheduling
policies (e.g., FIFO, RR, OTHER) by using the ORBSchedPolicy and
ORBScopePolicy options in svc.conf file.

- The server can be setup to use bands or no bands and thread lanes or
  no lanes.

- The client can be setup to use bands or no bands and different
  invocation priorities.  It creates a thread for each invocation
  priority and issues multiple requests to the server from each
  thread.

- The following policy combinations are tested in this example:
  __________________________________________________

  Server-side   Thread   Client-side  Multi-priority
     Bands       Lanes      Bands        Clients
