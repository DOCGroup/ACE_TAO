INTERFACE DEFINITION LANGUAGE SOURCE TREE ROADMAP
-===============================================-

INTRODUCTION

This file provides an overview of the directory structure of the sources
for the compiler front end for OMG Interface Definition Language. This will
be of use in understanding the source structure and will aid developers of
BEs.

DIRECTORIES

The following directories are present:

- idl_specs:  Contains many examples of IDL specifications, including the
	      IDL specifications of several Object Services, and several
	      files that somewhat exhaustively test features of the IDL
	      language
- include:    Contains all include (".hh") files
- ast:	      Contains implementations for all classes comprising
	      the AST internal representation of the input parsed
- fe:	      Contains the Yacc grammar and Lex specification for
	      the OMG Interface Definition Language, and some utilities
- driver:     Contains the main program which drives the compilation
	      process
- util:	      Contains utility classes used throughout the CFE. These
	      classes may also be of use in writing a BE
- narrow:     Contains an implementation of a narrowing mechanism used
	      in the CFE. Since C++ does not provide compiler support
	      for narrowing, this is provided as an explicit service
- demo_be:    Contains a demonstration back end which subclasses all
	      the AST classes but adds no functionality

NAMING CONVENTIONS

The file names start with two or three characters identifying the component
to which they belong:

- idl_:	      This is the prefix for all files which contain global
	      elements of the CFE
- ast_:	      This is the prefix for all files containing implementations
	      or definitions of the AST
- fe_:	      This is the prefix for all files belonging to the parser
- drv_:	      This is the prefix for all files belonging to the compiler
	      driver
- utl_:	      This prefix is used to identify files belonging to the set of
	      utlities provided with the CFE
- nr_:	      This prefix identifies files belonging to the narrowing mechanim
- be_:	      This is the prefix for all files belonging to the back end

All C++ files use the ".cc" extension, and all include files have the ".hh"
extension. All make files are named Makefile. Each directory contains a
make file. Lex input files have the ".ll" extension, and Yacc input files
use the ".yy" extension. All files containing IDL specifications have a
name ending with the ".idl" suffix.

INCLUDE FILE HIERARCHY

There are two main include files which must be included in all source
files. These are idl.hh and idl_extern.hh. The idl.hh file includes the
definitions for all the facilities provided by the CFE. The idl_extern.hh
file declares globally accessible data and exported application programmer
interface entry points.

Each component has an include file for its own. Back end writers will want
to modify be.hh and possibly be_extern.hh.
