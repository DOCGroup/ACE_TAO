        * tao/UB_String_Argument_T.cpp:
          Missed one of the changes with the original
          Wed Jan 13 16:30:00 UTC 2012 change:
          Was also directly calling delete [] on CORBA::strings
          instead of using CORBA::string_free(). As this delete []
          call was also inside a template however, it needed to actualy
          use the S_var::s_traits::release () that mapped this
          to the correct CORBA::string_free() call.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_utils.cpp(FE_Utils::can_be_redefined):

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_utils.cpp(FE_Utils::can_be_redefined):

          Fixed the logic for interface and its derived AST types - valuetype,
          eventtype and component. Since 5.7.9, a forward declared interface
          occurring after a fully defined interface included from another IDL
          file would give a bogus error. Thanks to Andrés Senac González
          <andres at senac dot es> for reporting the bug and supplying sample
          IDL.

        * tests/IDL_Test/included.idl:
        * tests/IDL_Test/including.idl:

          Added supplied IDL to test cases.
