This test is to verify the Notification Service client connection
validation feature.  

The test synthesizes a persistency file that points to a dummy 
service. The Notify service is then run so that it uses the 
persistency file to restore a topology and eventually reap the
proxies because the "ping" yields an OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception.

The result should be that after a few seconds, a new persistence 
file is created that contains no proxy references.

Run ./run_test.pl and it should output "test passed".
