TAO Audio/Video Streaming service
---------------------------------

This directory contains a complete distributed audio/video streaming
application.  This application uses interfaces and interactions

specification, which is available at the OMG web site.  An
implementation of the A/V Streaming specification is available for TAO
in the following directory.

The TAO application is a modified version of a streaming application
