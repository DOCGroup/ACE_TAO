This is a clone of the Hello World test. The differences are that an out string
argument is used rather than having ::get_string return string.

The out string argument is placed directly into the 0th element of a string
sequence of length 1 in the client.cpp.

Like the Hello World test this should always work (and not leak). Any other
results indicates a serious rabbit off situation.
