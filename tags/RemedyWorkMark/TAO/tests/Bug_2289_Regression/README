This test checks that collocation optimisation takes effect after a location forward is received to an in process servant.

It comprises:
1/ A trivial IDL interface (Test.idl) with a single method that passes a string and returns a boolean, this interface is implemented with a servant (MyInterfaceImpl) that returns true if the address of the string passed matches the address of a static string defined as a public member of the servant.
2/ A server which initialises a listener and binds a file:// type IOR for the client's servant into its IORTable against a name.
4/ A client which initialises an in process MyInterfaceImpl servant.

The client uses a corbaloc based on the server's endpoint and the name that its (the client's) reference is bound against in the server IORTable.

Narrowing this results in a remote is_a which causes the server ORB to send a locate_forward to the client directing it to the 'in process' servant.

If the fix is present the client ORB will pass the string by reference and the addresses will be equal in the servant - if the fix is not present it will attempt to marshal and demarshal the string, the addresses will differ, causing the test to fail.
