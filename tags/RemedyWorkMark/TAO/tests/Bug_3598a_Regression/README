$Id$

This test attempts to contact a server IOR with no connectable profile in it (on account of how there is no server running).

The method invocation should fail but the installed client request interceptor should have its send_request and receive_exception methods invoked regardless. 

The expected result looks like:

Client about to make method call that is doomed to failure...
ClientRequest_Interceptor::send_request called for operation: get_string - things are going well...
ClientRequest_Interceptor::receive_exception called for operation: get_string - test has succeeded...
Success - the server was unreachable and PI receive_exception was invoked.
