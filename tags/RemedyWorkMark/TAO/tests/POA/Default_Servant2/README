Default_Servants
================
	
	By using the USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT policy, the developer can create
	a POA that will use a single servant to implement all of its objects.
	This approach is useful when there is very little data associated 
	with each object, so little that the data can be encoded in the
	Object Id.

Example:
=======
	In the example implementation a Single Servant is enough to
	serve requests for a File Descriptor interface. The Object Id of the
	Descriptor objects are formed from the file handle returned by the
	System call. The servant can get the file handle from the object
	reference to process the request. Thus a single Descriptor servant
	can serve multiple objects.

SERVER:
======

	1. To run the server, type
	
	   % server [-ORBobjrefstyle URL]
			
CLIENT:
======
	The client tries to create a file "test" and writes a message to 
	the file and reads it back and prints it.

	1. To run the client, type

	   % client -k IOR

	where the IOR is got from the server output.
