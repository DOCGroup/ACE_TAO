Introduction:

This example illustrates the usage of the XtReactor from TAO.  The
server creates a small display dialog and the client displays a dialog
with a start and stop button.  On pressing the start button the server
dialog box starts a stopwatch.  On the pressing the stop the stopwatch
stops. On repressing the start the stopwatch resets and start all over
again.

To run the server and the client simply do the following:

$ server -o foo.ior
$ client -k file://foo.ior

Note: this test only does something useful if the Xtoolkit is enabled
and the executables linked against the following libraries Xm, Xt &
X11.

Technical Description:

In addition to specifying the resources that the ORB needs to allocate
for an Xt event loop, the ORB also needs the information about the
XtAppContext in which the user application is initialised. To provide
these information TAO provides a class by name TAO_XtResource_Loader which is
responsible for create and instance of TAO_XtResource_Factory that inherits
from the TAO_Default_Resource_factory. TAO_XtResource_Loader has a constructor
parameterized the application context necessary for integration of ACE_XtReactor
with Xt event loop.

Please notice also that the server and client  run on the Xt event loop by
calling the  XtAppMainLoop ().
