# No options required for regular testing
# I've followed the pattern of other real time tests here - basically the client / server part of this
# test is a no-op (as are they) unless you *do* modify this file.

# For real-time testing, uncomment the following line:
# static RT_ORB_Loader "-ORBSchedPolicy SCHED_FIFO -ORBScopePolicy SYSTEM -ORBPriorityMapping linear"
