    <h3>Introduction - Improving the Server</h3>
    
    <P>In this section, we will improve the

      </A>
      which we have developed before. We will use POA policies
      to create an object with a persistent object reference.
    </P>
    <P>
      The characteristics of a POA are controlled via POA policies
      that are specified when the POA is created.
      POA policies all have the same form:  their values are specified
      at creation time using an enumerated type.
      In our example we will use the <CODE>LifeSpanPolicy</CODE>
      that controls how the lifetime of object references relates to
      the lifetime of the POAs that generate the object references
      and the <CODE>IdAssignmentPolicy</CODE> that controls how
      object ids are assigned.
    </P>

    <P>
      CORBA Objects that can live irrespective of any particular
      process in which they are created or activated are called
      <EM>Persistent Objects</EM>.
      Likewise,
      shorter-lived objects whose lifetimes are bound to the
      lifetime of the POA in which they are created are called
      <EM>Transient Objects</EM>.
      Notice that this has nothing to do with the state of the object:
      an application can create transient objects to access some
      persistent information maintained in a database.
      For example,
      such objects can represent a different session or transaction view
      of the data.
      Similarly, some persistent object references may have no state
      or no persistent state.
      For example, a logging facility is persistent because it is
      always available, but it may maintain no state or simply cache
      some state for the current activation.
      In general, though,
      objects that have persistent state are accessed throught
      persistent object references.
    </P>
    <P>
      The standard life span policy for the RootPOA is
      <CODE>TRANSIENT</CODE>.
      This means that any application that needs to support persistent
      objects must create at least another POA with the Persistent
      life span policy.
      In our example we will create two policies for this child POA.
      One policy is the <CODE>LifeSpanPolicy</CODE> which we will set
      to be <CODE>PERSISTENT</CODE>.
      Usually applications that create persistent object references
      also set the <CODE>IdAssignmentPolicy</CODE>,
      so they can assign the object ids in a predictable way,
      consistent across server activations.
      It is possible, but very unusual, to use system ids with
      persistent object references.
    </P>
    <!--
    <P>A POA identifies its object by an object identifier, specified 
      using the ObjectId type, defined in the PortableServer module.
      Within the scope of a POA, all Object IDs must be unique.
      An application can either supply its own ObjectID or have the
      POA create object identifiers for it.
      This Object identification is controlled by the IdAssignmentPolicy. If
      the policy value is set to be <CODE>USER_ID</CODE>, the application has 
      the choice. Otherwise, if this policy value is set to be 
      <CODE>SYSTEM_ID</CODE>, the RootPOA creates the ObjectIDs.
      Let's give our 
      application a choice for the creation of its Object's IDs. 
    </P>
    -->
    <P>For more about POA and its policies,
      please refer to
      "Advanced CORBA Programming with C++"
      by Henning and Vinoski.
      The TAO distribution also includes many examples on how to use
      the POA and its policies in the 
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/examples/POA</CODE> 
      directory.
    </P> 

    <H3>Child POA Creation</H3>
     
    <P>
      As before, we first initialize the ORB,
      and obtain a reference to the Root POA.
    </P>
 <PRE>
    CORBA::ORB_var orb = CORBA::ORB_init (argc, argv);
    CORBA::Object_var poa_object = 
      orb->resolve_initial_references ("RootPOA");
    PortableServer::POA_var poa = 
      PortableServer::POA::_narrow (poa_object.in ());
 </PRE>    

    <P>
      Next we get the <CODE>POAManager</CODE> of the <CODE>RootPOA</CODE>
      and use it to activate the <CODE>RootPOA</CODE>
    </P>
 <PRE>
    PortableServer::POAManager_var poa_manager = 
      poa->the_POAManager ();
    
    poa_manager->activate ();
 </PRE>
    
    <P>
      Now we create a <CODE>LifeSpanPolicy</CODE>
      object with the <CODE>PERSISTENT</CODE> value:
 <PRE>
    // Create a PERSISTENT LifespanPolicy object
    PortableServer::LifespanPolicy_var lifespan = 
      poa->create_lifespan_policy (PortableServer::PERSISTENT);
</PRE>
    <P>
      and next we create an <CODE>IdAssignmentPolicy</CODE> object with
      the <CODE>USER_ID</CODE> value:
    </P>
<PRE>    
    // Create a USER_ID IdAssignmentPolicy object
    PortableServer::IdAssignmentPolicy_var idassignment = 
      poa->create_id_assignment_policy (PortableServer::USER_ID);
 </PRE>
    <P>Next we can initialize the sequence of policies:
    </P>
 <PRE>
    CORBA::PolicyList polices (2);
    policies.length (2);
    policies[0] =
      PortableServer::IdAssignmentPolicy::_duplicate (idassignment);
    policies[1] = 
      PortableServer::LifespanPolicy::_duplicate (lifespan);
 </PRE>
    <!-- @@ Priyanka: I noticed that you used "let's" and "doesn't"
    several times, I understand that it is not good style for
    professional looking documents, then again it may be my fault,

    -->
    <P>Child POAs are created using the <CODE>create_POA</CODE>
      operation on the parent POA.
    </P>
 <PRE>
    PortableServer::POA_var child_poa = 
      poa->create_POA ("childPOA", 
                        poa_manager.in (), 
                        policies);
 </PRE>
    <P>The values which we pass to this <CODE>create_POA</CODE> operation are
      the name of the child POA, the POAManager of the child POA, and the 
      <CODE>CORBA::PolicyList</CODE>.
      We can create a child controlled by a new
      <CODE>POAManager</CODE> by passing
      a <CODE>nil</CODE> reference,
      but commonly the <CODE>POAManager</CODE> of the parent is used.
    </P>
    <P>Finally, we can now destroy the life span policy and id assignment 
      policy objects, since they are no longer needed. The 
      <CODE>create_POA</CODE> operation will make a copy of the objects in the 
      policy list and the newly created POA will refer to the copies of the 
      objects passed to the <CODE>create_POA</CODE>.

    idassignment->destroy ();
    lifespan->destroy ();
 </PRE>

    <H3>Activating Objects in the child POA </H3>

    <P>Now that we have created a new POA, let's use this POA to activate the
      stock objects. The first step would be to create an instance of the 
      stock factory implementation. 
  <PRE>
    // Create a servant of class Quoter_Stock_Factory_i
    Quoter_Stock_Factory_i stock_factory_i;
  </PRE>
    <P>
      Objects can be activated explicitly using the
      <CODE>activate_object_with_id ()</CODE> 
      operation.
      This operation has two input parameters:
      id of the object and a pointer to the servant that implements
      it.
      We create the id using a helper function:
    </P>
 <PRE>
    PortableServer::ObjectId_var oid = 
      PortableServer::string_to_ObjectId ("Stock_Factory");
 </PRE>
    <P>Next, we can activate the "Stock_Factory" object:
    </P>
 <PRE>
    child_poa->activate_object_with_id (oid.in (),
                                        &stock_factory_i);
 </PRE>
    <P>
      This operation does not return the object reference of the new
      object,
      but we can use the <CODE>id_to_reference</CODE> operation
      to obtain the object reference:
    </P>
 <PRE>
    CORBA::Object_var stock_factory = 
      child_poa->id_to_reference (oid.in ());
 </PRE>
    <P>As before, we convert the object reference into an IOR string
      so that the client can use it.
    </P>
 <PRE>
    CORBA::String_var ior = orb->object_to_string (stock_factory.in ());
    std::cout << ior.in () << std::endl;
 </PRE>
    <P>As we know already, the final step before a client's request can 
      get processed would be to run the ORB event loop.  Last, we destroy
      the POA, waiting until the destruction terminates.
    </P>
 <PRE>
    orb->run ();

    // Destroy the POA
    poa->destroy (1,1);
    orb->destroy ();
 </PRE>

    <H3>Exercise</H3>

    Modify the <a href=../Server/server.cpp>server.cpp</a> in the simple
    server to  create the persistent child POA.
    You can use the same

    <H3>Testing</H3>
    You can use the <a href=../Client/client.cpp>client.cpp</a> to check
    the results, as follows:

    <P>Normally the ORB selects a listening endpoint at random.
      This is inadequate for applications with persistent object
      references because the references will become invalid if the
      server restarts in a new listening endpoint.
      In TAO we can control the listening endpont(s) using the
      <!-- @@ Priyanka: can you add a URL for the document that

      <CODE>-ORBEndPoint</CODE> option.
      For example, for the IIOP protocol,
      the endpoint information contains the name or IP address of the
      host and a free TCP port number.

      Without an Implementation Repository the client ORB cannot
