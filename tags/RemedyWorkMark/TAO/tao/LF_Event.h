/**
 * @class TAO_LF_Event
 *
 * @brief Use the Leader/Follower loop to wait for one specific event.
 *
 * The Leader/Follower event loop is used to wait for incoming
 * responses, as well as to wait for all the data to be flushed.
 * This class encapsulates this event loop. It uses Template Method to
 * parametrize the 'waited for' predicate (i.e. reply received or
 * message sent or connection establishment etc.)
 *
 * @todo Implementing the Leader/Followers loop in this class, as
 * well as the callbacks to communicate that an event has completed
 * leads to excessive coupling.  A better design would use a separate
 * class to signal the events, that would allow us to remove the
 * Leader/Followers logic from the ORB.  However, that requires other
 * major changes and it somewhat complicates the design.
