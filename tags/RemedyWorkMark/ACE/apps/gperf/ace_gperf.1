.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIace_gperf\fP reads a set of ``keys'' from \fIkeyfile\fP (or, by
default, from the standard input) and attempts to find a non-minimal
perfect hashing function that recognizes a member of the key set in
constant, i.e., O(1), time.  If such a function is found the program
generates a pair of \fIC\fP source code routines that perform the
hashing and table lookup.  All generated code is directed to the
standard output.

Please refer to the \fIace_gperf.texinfo\fP file for more information.
This file is distributed with \fIace_gperf\fP release.
