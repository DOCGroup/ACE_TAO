/**
 * Provides an Iterator that expands and decodes a control string
 * containing digits and ranges, returning an integer every time the
 * generator function is called.
 *
 * This class is used to decode the user's key position requests.
 * For example: "-k 1,2,5-10,$" will return 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
 * 10, and 0 ( representing the abstract ``last character of the
 * key'' on successive calls to the member function operator ().
 * No errors are handled in these routines, they are passed back
 * to the calling routines via a user-supplied Error_Value
