# Configuration file that the gatewayd process uses to determine
# connection information about proxies.
#
# The following provides an explanation for the fields in this file,
# and how they relate to fields in the corresponding "consumer_config"
# file.
#
# 1. Connection ID -- Each Connection Handler is given a unique ID
#    that is used in the "consumer_config" file to specify to which
#    Consumers the Event Channel will forward incoming events from
#    Suppliers using that connection.  The Connection ID field is the
#    "key" that is used to match up connections in this file with the
#    Consumer subscription requests in the "consumer_config" file.
#    The connection ids should start at 1 and monotonically increase
#    by increments of 1.  This makes it possible for the Gateway to
#    properly allocate connection ids for Peers that connect to it.
#
# 2. Host -- The host name where the Supplier/Consumer peerd
#    process is running.
#
# 3. Remote Port -- The port number where the remote
#    Supplier/Consumer peerd process is listening on.
#    If this is a '*' character it is an indication to the
#    Gateway to use the "default value," e.g., which can be provided
#    on the command-line, etc.
#
# 4. Handler Role -- i.e., Consumer ('C') or Supplier ('S')
#
# 5. Max Retry Timeout -- The maximum amount of time that we'll
#    wait between retry attempts (these start at 1 second and
#    double until they reach the Max Retry Timeout).
#    If this is a '*' character it is an indication to the
#    Gateway to use the "default value," e.g., which can be provided
#    on the command-line, etc.
#
# 6. Local Port -- The port number that we want to use for
#    our local Proxy connection.  If this is the value 0 or the '*'
#    character, then we'll let the socket implementation pick this
#    value for us.
#
# 7. Priority -- Each Consumer/Supplier can be given a priority
#    that will determine its importance relative to other
#    Consumers/Suppliers (this feature isn't implemented yet).
