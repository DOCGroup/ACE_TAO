0) collapse CMU and HP code - make this thing faster since it is really
   slow and bulky...

1) implement response time statistics collection so that timeout can vary based
   on empirical response times

2) Implement pdu fragmentation based on tooBig errors or app directed
   Snmp::set_pdu_max_size() command 

3) implement async interface

4) make templatized version to implement sync/nonsync (thread safe version)

5) add V2c when a real agent is in the field that supports it

6) Add DISMAN support when IETF approves the Expression Mib

7) way too many procedural case stmts in the code...

8) add compare_right() method to be orthogonal to oid class.
