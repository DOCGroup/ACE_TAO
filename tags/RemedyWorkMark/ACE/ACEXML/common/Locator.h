/**
 * @class ACEXML_Locator Locator.h "ACEXML/common/Locator.h"
 *
 * @brief ACEXML_Locator defines operations that an XML locator should support.
 *
 * If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 * application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 * passing an instance to the application using the content handler's
 * setDocumentLocator method. The application can use the object to
 * obtain the location of any other content handler event in the XML
 * source document.
 *
 * Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 * during the scope of each content handler method: the application
 * will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 * locator at any other time.
 *
 * SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are very
 * strongly encouraged to do so. If the parser supplies a locator, it
 * must do so before reporting any other document events. If no
 * locator has been set by the time the application receives the
 * startDocument event, the application should assume that a locator
 * is not available.
