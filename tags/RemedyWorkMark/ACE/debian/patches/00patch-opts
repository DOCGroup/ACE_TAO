# By default dpatch works with -p1 (patch level 1) which works
# fine with one working directory, e.g. ACE_wrappers. While
# two working directories exist the default -p1 makes thinks
# complicate. Instaed of recreate patches we overwrite the
# dpatch_patch and dpatch_unpatch functions with -p0.
# See /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch.lib.sh for more implementation
# details on this issue.
