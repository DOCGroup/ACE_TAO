# $Id$

This test tests whether the connection attributes
can be set once the configuration is complete.
This shouldn't be allowed and therefore a
NonChangeable exception must be thrown.

The following attributes are tested:
  * key_fields
  * domain_id
  * qos_profile
  * topic_name

An error is reported for every attribute where
no NonChangeable exception was catched.
