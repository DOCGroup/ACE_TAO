The follow steps is how you import IDL input PICML for the Shapes
example so that the IDL generator works properly.

%> idl_to_picml -x Shapes -l $CIAO_ROOT/connectors/dds4ccm/models/dds4ccm -r .

Please notice the -l command-line option, which is something new
to idl_to_picml. If you type --help, the -l option will be listed.

What this will do is not only import the IDL in the Shapes directory, 
but also attach the dds4ccm.xme file as a GME library to the Shapes 
example. Furthermore, it will search the attached library to resolve 
any references that it cannot find based on parsing IDL files located 
in the Shapes subdirectories (or the one specified at the command-line).

After doing this, you should be able to import the Shapes example 
and generate the IDL files, which there original location retained,
which is also something new to idl_to_picml and the IDL generator. ;-)
