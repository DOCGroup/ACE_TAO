This is a simple CORBA example that has an object (Time) with
only two methods, one that returns the current time of day on a
server and another that shuts down the server.

server:
-------

server [-d] [-o <ior_output_file>] 

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag (It is additive more -d flags will give debugging).
-o    Outputs the server ior to the file


When the server is started, you should see as the first line of output 
something that looks like
	iiop:1.0//danzon.cs.wustl.edu:10015/P35ad159600081a38/child_poa/server
	(-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
	(-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  This option is additive, i.e.,
the more -d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the
moment, only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d
options are ignored.

client:
-------

client [-d] [-x] [-f <Server_ior_file>] [-n iterations] [-k ior]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag
-x    Tells the server to shutdown at the end of the test.
-f    Reads the server ior from the file
-n    no. of iterations
-k    IOR
	
You can either cut and paste the IOR from the server to the client
(with the -k option), or have the client read the IOR from a file
using the -f option. (This file is produced using the -o option of the
server.)
	
run_test.pl:
------------

This is a perl script which runs the server and client, and shuts down
the server when it is done.
