<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
The implementation of Xmit isn't too complicated.  If we choose to
combine it with the Recv task we simply lift the recv() method from
that object and drop it into this one.
<P>
Note that close() must decide if it's being called when the stream is
shutdown or when it's svc() method exits.  Since we tell the baseclass 
not to use any threads it's a safe bet that flags will always be
non-zero.  Still, it's good practice to plan for the future by
checking the value.
<P>
Note also that when we send the data we prefix it with the data size.
This let's our sibling Recv ensure that an entire block is received
together.  This can be very important for compression and encryption
processes which typically work better with blocks of data instead of
streams of data.
