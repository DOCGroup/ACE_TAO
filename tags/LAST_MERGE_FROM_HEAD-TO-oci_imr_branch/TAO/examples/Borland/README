Before compiling the example in The Borland C++ Builder IDE
you must generate the client and server stubs using build_idl.bat.
Please update the location of the tao_idl dependent on your build
configuration. The default location is for a BCB4 Dynamic Debug
Pascal configuration.

In the project file you must also update the names of the ACE and
TAO libraries that you use. The configured names are for the BCB4
Dynamic Debug Pascal configuration.

This directory illustrates how to write a Borland C++ Builder
application using ACE+TAO.  Please contact Jody Hagins
<jody@atdesk.com> if you have any questions.
