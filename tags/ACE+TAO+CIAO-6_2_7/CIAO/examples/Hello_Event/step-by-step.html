<h2>Simple <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO">CIAO</a> tutorial</h2>
<b>Note:</b>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/cosmic">CoSMIC</a> tools are not used in this tutorial.</li>
  <li>This is only a <em>GENERAL</em> way of building up a CIAO application and deploying it with DAnCE.
    The user could always change the process in his own way. For example: the IDL file content, the project structure etc.
  </li>
  <li>An CCM application may consist of several components, deployed on several (hardware) nodes, which work
    together as one big application.
  </li>
  <li>To download the code of this example please refer to the SVN repository at <code>$CIAO_ROOT/examples/Hello</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Example Description</h2>
This Hello example is contructed in the following ways:
<ol>
  <li>There are 2 components in the application: Sender and Receiver</li>
  <li>The Sender will send out the timeout event to the Receiver.</li>
  <li>Upon receiving the timeout event, the Receiver will go and fetch data from the Sender. </li>
  <li>The user could deploy multiple instances of the Receiver without changing any C++/idl source code.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Code generation</h2>
Note that an user only need to write the IDL files. All the rest of the files can be generated.
The following code generators are used throughout this example:
<ul>
  <li><code>$CIAO_ROOT/bin/generate_component_mpc.pl</code><br/>
    This perl script is able to generate MPC files out of a single name.
    <a href="http://downloads.ociweb.com/MPC/MakeProjectCreator.pdf">MPC</a> is a utility we use
    to generate makefiles or VC project/solution files for all
    <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a>,
    <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</a> and
    <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/CIAO.html">CIAO</a>
    libraries and executables.<br/>
  </li>
  <li><code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/tao_idl</code>
    Besides all the stub and skeleton code, the TAO IDL compiler is also suitable to generate the
    so called executor files. An executor C++ code file contains the business logic
    the user need to write. Since this should be deployable by the DAnCE framework, there're
    some restriction to this code. The TAO IDL compiler takes care of that.
  </li>
  <li><code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl</code>
    This script will generate VS solutions and/or GNU makefiles out of the generated
    MPC files.
  </li>
</ul>
All these generators will be handled throughout this tutorial.
<br/><br/>
If there's a ccm_noevent entry in your default.features (location
<code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/</code>), make sure it's set to 0 (nil)!

<h2>Step-By-Step</h2>
<h3>Hello_Base</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Write an IDL file (<a href="./Hello_Base/Hello_Base.idl"><code>Hello_Base.idl</code></a>) which contains all
      the interfaces and events common to all the components. The reason
      we do this is because the generated lib of this idl file will be
      linked in by all the components in the application. To reduce the size
      of the component lib we have to include only the necesary part. In
      this example, we have an eventtype <code>timeout</code> and an
      interface <code>ReadMessage</code>, which are used by both the
      Sender and the Receiver, so we put both of them in <a href="Hello_Base/Hello_Base.idl">Hello_Base.idl</a>.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>Look at the <a href="Hello_Base/Hello_Base.mpc"><code>Hello_Base.mpc</code></a> file to get an idea how the Hello_Base_stub
      and Hello_Base_svnt projects are organized.<br/>
      There's a utility in $CIAO_ROOT/bin, called generate_component_mpc. This a perl script which is able to generate a complete
      mpc file based on a given name. The commandline used to generate <code>Hello_Base.mpc</code> is:<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>$CIAO_ROOT/bin/generate_component_mpc.pl -e -n -l../lib -o../lib Hello_Base</code><br/>
      Use <code>$CIAO_ROOT/bin/generate_component_mpc.pl --help</code> to get more information about this tool.
      See also the <a href="../../tutorials/Quoter/Simple/01.html">Quoter tutorial</a> for more information.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>For Every Component</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Execute : <br>
  <ul>
    <li><code>$CIAO_ROOT/bin/generate_component_mpc.pl -e -l ../lib -o ../lib -c starter -p Hello_Base Sender</code> in Sender directory.
      The <code>-c</code> option will be handled <a href="#entry_point">later</a> on in the step-by-step.
    </li>
    <li><code>$CIAO_ROOT/bin/generate_component_mpc.pl -e -l ../lib -o ../lib -p Hello_Base Receiver</code> in Receiver directory
    </li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>There're different directories for <code>"Hello_Base", "Sender", "Receiver"</code> respectively.
    </li>
    <li>All output DLL's/executable will be stored in a separate directory, called "lib".
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br/>

  <li>Write an IDL file for every component (<a href="Sender/Sender.idl"><code>Sender.idl</code></a> and
      <a href="Receiver/Receiver.idl"><code>Receiver.idl</code></a>). <br> Here you can put the
      component specific IDL definitions in this file. In this example we have a interface <code>trigger</code>
      specific to the Sender. Please note that the Sender component
      <code>"supports"</code> (IDL keyword) this interface. This interface can be used by
      <a href="Sender/starter.cpp"><code>starter</code></a> (an IDL 2 client) to start the application.
  </li>

  <br/>

  <li>There's a possibility that the TAO IDL compiler can generate a 'template'
    for the executor code (=business logic).
    Steps to generate the executor files:
    <ol>
      <li>Backup the following files to a temporary directory:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Sender/Sender_exec.cpp
          </li>
          <li>Sender/Sender_exec.h
          </li>
          <li>Receiver/Receiver_exec.cpp
          </li>
          <li>Receiver/Receiver_exec.h
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add -Gex to the <code>idlflags</code> entry in the
        IDL generator projects in the MPC file, meaning
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Project <code>Hello_Base_Sender_idl_gen</code> in Sender/Sender.mpc
          </li>
          <li>Project <code>Hello_Base_Receiver_idl_gen</code> in Receiver/Receiver.mpc
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Generate GNUmakefiles / VS project files and build
      </li>
      <li>Remove -Gex(r) again
      </li>
      <li>Generate GNUmakefiles / VS project files (and build)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Mind the last step! The TAO IDL compiler does not check whether the
      executor file already exists. It will overwrite the existing!</b><br/><br/>
    After step 2 the following files should be overwritten:
    <ul>
      <li>Sender/Sender_exec.cpp
      </li>
      <li>Sender/Sender_exec.h
      </li>
      <li>Receiver/Receiver_exec.cpp
      </li>
      <li>Receiver/Receiver_exec.h
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Performing all steps could be troublesome to a new CCM user. The
best way of learning this is to just do it more than once. I'll also help to
read the example source code. If you are familliar with CORBA programming,
it should not take too much time before you can declare yourself as a CCM programmer.<br/>

<hr>

<a name="entry_point"><h3>The Entry Point</h3></a>

After both components are implemented we still need a small program to
initialize the process. In Sender.idl there is a Sender specific
interface with a single method in it created for this purpose. Hence
there is a CORBA client application called <code>starter</code>. The
<code>starter</code> will make a invocation on a supported interface
called <code>trigger</code> on the Sender component to get the whole
distributed application started. The <code>starter</code> will first
obtain the Sender component object reference through the ior string
supplied as a command argument. Please see the the last part of
<code>Sender/Sender.mpc</code> file for details. <br/>

<hr>

<h3>Build</h3>

This example assumes that ACE/TAO/CIAO/DANCE is build. If not, please
follow the instructions to build these frameworks.<br/>
<b>Tip : </b>Experienced users may want to use <code>$CIAO_ROOT/CIAO_TAO_DAnCE.mwc</code>
to generate the needed VC project/solutions or GNU make files.<br/>

Perform the following steps to build this example: <br/>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <code>$CIAO_ROOT/examples/Hello</code>
  </li>
  <li>For windows:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual C++ 2005: execute <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type vc8</code>
      </li>
      <li>Visual C++ 2008: execute <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type vc9</code>
      </li>
      <li>Visual C++ 2010: execute <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type vc10</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For linux:<br/>
    Execute <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
Build this example using Visual Studio or make.<br/>

<hr>

<h3>Assemble</h3>

Now we can step forward to build the assembly. Here we are going to
build the simplest case only, which is 1 Receiver and 1 Sender. If you
are interested in CIAO you could try 1 Sender with multiple
Receivers. However, you need to change the Sender.idl to make it
<em>publishes</em> timeout event instead of <em>emits</em> event.<br>
Note: Creating the deployment plan descriptor is a tedious and error-prone job,
you can download <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/cosmic">CoSMIC</a> to
assist you in this step.
<br/><br/>
You need to create an XML descriptor file to describe your <em>deployment plan</em>,
which is defined in a <em>Deployment Plan Descriptor</em> (.cdp)
(see <a href="./descriptors/DeploymentPlan.cdp">Hello deployment plan<a>).
In this file, you need to declaratively specify how the component assembly is
constructed. Specificly, you need to specify the component types, component instances,
component connections, implementation artifact descriptions, and whether you
want to register component instances with naming service.
<br/><br/>

<hr>

<h3>Deploy with <A href="../../docs/releasenotes/dance.html">DAnCE</A></h3>
Once the DeploymentPlan is ready, the apllication can be deployed, using the newly
created Deployment Plan.
<br/><br/>

Next figure shows how DAnCE will handle the deployment plan.<br/>

<img width="70%" height="80%" src="./dance_deployment_runtime.png" />
<br/><br/>

To deploy the application, we're using perl scripts to launch the executables
of which DAnCE consist.
A perl script typically launches the DAnCE executables in this order:
<ol>
  <li>Naming service (if needed).
  </li>
  <li>A DAnCE Node Manager for each node.
  </li>
  <li>The DAnCE Execution Manager.
  </li>
  <li>The DAnCE Plan Launcher.
  </li>
</ol>

See <a href=./descriptors/run_test.pl">run_test.pl</a> for an example.

<br><br>

The two most important variations:
<ol>
  <li>Deploying the application, using the naming service. See
    <a href=./descriptors/run_test.pl">run_test.pl</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Deploying the application, without the use of the naming service. See
    <a href=./descriptors/run_test_without_ns.pl">run_test_without_ns.pl</a>
  </li>
</ol>
When using the first option, one will need to write a cdd-file. This file dictates
which nodes are available in the system and which CORBA IIOP is necessary to
contact these. Click <a href="./descriptors/NodeManagerMap.cdd">here</a> for
an example of a CDD file.
