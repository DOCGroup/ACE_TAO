Description
-----------

This directory contains a three stage AV test with the ability to
aynschronously start the processes in any order. It also supports
multiple receivers for a sender.  The stages are:

a. Sender
b. Distributer
c. Receiver

This test has a sender process that reads data from a file and sends
it to the distributer. The distributer acts as a conduit. It receives
data from the sender and sends it immediately to the receiver process.

Running the test
----------------

Start the Naming Service

Start the following processes in any order.

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-r <data_rate>] [-s <sender device name>] [-a <address_file>]

-f filename --> The name of the file from which data needs to be sent

-r data_rate --> The rate at which the data needs to be paced.

-s sender device name --> This is the name of the sender as it will be
                          registered with the naming service and which
                          receivers connect to.

-a address_file -->	  This file contains the sender and receiver
			  endpoint addressses to be used to set up a
			  flow for each flow. The format for each flow
			  is Flowname/sender_endpoint_host:sender_endpoint_port/receiver_endpoint_host:receiver_endpoint_port
			  If no endpoint addresses are specified default addresses would be used.


receiver
--------

receiver [-f <filename>] [-s <sender device name>] [-r <receiver device name>] [-a <address_file>]

-f filename --> File into which the data received from the distributer is stored.

-s sender device name --> This is the name of the sender that the
                          receiver wants to connect to.

-r receiver device name --> This is the name with which this receiver
                            will be registered with the naming
                            service.

-a address_file -->	  This file contains the sender and receiver
			  endpoint addressses to be used to set up a
			  flow for each flow. The format for each flow
			  is Flowname/sender_endpoint_host:sender_endpoint_port/receiver_endpoint_host:receiver_endpoint_port
			  If no endpoint addresses are specified default addresses would be used.


distributer:
-----------

distributer [-s <sender device name>] [-r <distributer device name>] [-a <address_file>]

-s sender device name --> This is the name of the sender that the
                          distributer wants to connect to.

-r distributer device name --> This is the name with which this
                               distributer will be registered with the
                               naming service. The receivers will bind
                               with this name to receieve data from
                               this distributer.

-a address_file -->	  This file contains the sender and receiver
			  endpoint addressses to be used to set up a
			  flow for each flow. The format for each flow
			  is Flowname/sender_endpoint_host:sender_endpoint_port/receiver_endpoint_host:receiver_endpoint_port
			  If no endpoint addresses are specified default addresses would be used.
