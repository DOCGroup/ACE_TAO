This test verifies the fix for bug 4152 by starting the IMR Activator with a
parameter to induce a delay between the time when a child server dies and when
the Locator is informed of the death. This gap provides the opportunity for the
Locator to request a new server child which would be lost prior to the fix,
allowing for a spurious 3rd instance to be started. With the fix in place, only
two instances are started.

The server instances append their pid to a status file, which the run script
interogates for judging success.

Runtime options are -debug to turn on verbose debugging to separate log files
and -no_dns, which forces the use of 127.0.0.1 in endpoints for running in
environments inwhich DNS is not properly configured.
