@page Big_Request_Muxing Test README File

	This is a stress test for the non-blocking I/O features in the
ORB when used to send oneways and reliable oneways.  A client process
creates multiple threads, each thread sends (large) oneway requests
with different levels of reliability.  The main thread runs the ORB
event loop.  The thread also configures connection muxing in the ORB,
forcing all the threads to share the same connection.  This level of
concurrency is designed to test as many code sequences in the ORB
output data as possible.

	This is part of the regression testsuite for:

http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=132

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
