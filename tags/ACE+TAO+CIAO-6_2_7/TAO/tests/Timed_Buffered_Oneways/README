Description:

This is a test for oneways with buffering and timing constraints.  The
client sends is setup to send large requests to the server.  The
server is setup to take a long time to process these requests.  The
combination will cause flow control for the client.  The timing
constraints on the client ORB will prevent the client from blocking
because of flow control.  The request is queued up for later delivery
once the flow control subsides.

Controlling the test:

The client invokes a oneway of size <data_bytes> after every
<interval> amount of time.  The amount of time taken by the server to
process the request is <remote_work>.  Blocking on the client is
prevented by <roundtrip_timeout>.

Expected output:

The client should be able to make steady progress, i.e., should not be
effected by flow control, while the server is slow to catch up.  At
the end of the client application, it will block to make sure that any
unsent data is delivered to the server.

How to run:

You can use the run_test.pl script to run it or:

$ server
$ client
