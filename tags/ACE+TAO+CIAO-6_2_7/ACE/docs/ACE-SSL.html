    <H3>What is ACE+SSL?</H3>
    <p>ACE plus SSL is an addition to the core classes which allow the use
      of the Secure Socket Layer with the ACE framework. The following
      are the core classes conditionally compiled in when you run
      <code>make ssl=1</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ACE_SSL contains the interface to the ssl library OpenSSL.
      <li><code>ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream</code> uses an interface and
	behavior nearly identical to <code>ACE_SOCK_Stream</code>,
	only with the additional ssl layer functionality.
      <li><code>ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor</code>/<code>Connector</code>
	are again similar to their <code>ACE_SOCK</code> counterparts.
    </ul>

    <p>The SSL/TLS library we use is OpenSSL which is available at
      <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</A>.
      This library must be installed in order to use ACE+SSL.  We
      cannot answer all of the questions you may have about OpenSSL,
      but hopefully through using the ACE+SSL interface your questions
      will be reduced.</p> 

    <H3>How do I get ACE+SSL?</H3>
    <p>Due to the relaxation of export restrictions we have gained
      permission to distribute ACE+SSL along with the normal ACE
      distribution. It can be found in $ACE_ROOT/ace/SSL. An SSL
      pluggable transport for can be found in
      $ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP.
