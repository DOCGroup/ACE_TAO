   simple typedef we had in Tutorial 5.

   Why keep the thread pool as a member?  If we go back to the inetd
   concept you'll recall that we need several acceptors to make that
   work.  We may have a situation in which our different client types
   requre different resources.  That is, we may need a large thread
   pool for some client types and a smaller one for others.  We could
   share a pool but then the client types may have undesirable impact
   on one another.

   Just in case you do want to share a single thread pool, there is a
   constructor below that will let you do that.  */</font>

<P>Well, except for the new Thread_Pool member variable, most of the changes
are informational.
