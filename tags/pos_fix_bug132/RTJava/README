This directory contains a series of benchmarks for evaluating the
RealTime JVM performance, and a series of example that are intented
to show how certain feature of the RT Java should be used.

Make sure you read the file docs/CodingStyle.txt before you start
adding code to the repository, so that all our code can look uniform
and it will be easier for all of us to understand and read each
other code.
