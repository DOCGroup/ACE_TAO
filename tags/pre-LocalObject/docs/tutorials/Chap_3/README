Note:

Example 2 (ex02.html) will not compile and work on Win32 because
it relies on SystemV Shared Memory and fork() which are not
available on that platoform.

Example 3 (ex03.html) is basically the same but uses a memory-mapped
file instead of SYSV Shared Memory.  It also takes a single command
line parament 's' to start it in server mode or 'c' to start it
in client mode.  (This is to work around the lack of fork()).

(Thanks to Nanbor Wang for working this out for us.)
