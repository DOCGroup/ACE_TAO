	This test tries to stress the Event_Service by sending events
in bursts, the user can control the size of the events, the size of
the burst, the number of bursts and the time between the bursts, the
number of suppliers and the number of consumers.

        There are two versions of the test, a collocated version and a
version using a remote event channel.

        Both versions require a Naming Service, a usual execution for
the collocated test would be:

# Each command in a separate shell or window:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ./ECT_Throughput

        and for the non-collocated test:

# Each command in a separate shell or window:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ../../Event_Service/Event_Service
$ ../../ECT_Consumer
$ ../../ECT_Supplier

        It is important that the consumer knows exactly how many
suppliers are sending events, otherwise it cannot terminate properly,
a typical use would be:

# Each command in a separate shell or window:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ../../Event_Service/Event_Service
$ ../../ECT_Consumer -s 4
$ ../../ECT_Supplier -s 4
