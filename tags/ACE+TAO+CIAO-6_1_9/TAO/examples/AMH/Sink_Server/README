Building the servers:
---------------------
Single Threaded Server: make st_server
Multi  Threaded Server: make mt_server


Running the servers:
--------------------
Single threaded AMH Sink Server:
st_server -ORBsvcconf st_server.conf -o <ior_output_file> -s <sleep_time (in microseconds)>

e.g.: st_server -o test.ior -s 20000
to delay a reply to the client by 20 milliseconds.

Both options are necessary and there are no defaults.


Multi Threaded AMH Sink Server:
mt_server -o <ior_output_file>  -n <num_threads>  -s <sleep_time (in microseconds)>

Giving the parameters in the right order is STRONGLY recommended.
Unexpected behaviour may result otherwise.  All three options are
necessary and there are no defaults


How the server works:
---------------------
- Each client request is 'timed' (with the sleep_time) and registered
in the ORB's reactor.

- Upon expiration of the timer, the reactor fires the timer_handler
and the AMH RH servant method is called to send the reply to the
client.


NOTES:
------
On Linux systems, set POSIXLY_CORECT=1 for correct behaviour in
parsing of command line arguments.
