Simple codeset translation test.

As delivered, this test works with the IBM1047 - ISO8859 translator which is
built as part of the library delivered with this test.

After building the client and server, run one or the other with the supplied
configuration file. Be sure to supply the configuration file to only one side
or the other, not both. If you do both, no translation will happen.

If the translators and the framework are working properly you will see the
client report some text before and after a call. The before and after should be
identical. The server side should look like garbage.

In the test call, a string is passed as an IN argument and a copy returned as
the return value of the call. Also, a different string is inserted into an Any,
which is passed as an IN argument. An Any is returned as an OUT
argument which contains a copy of the IN string. The purpose of this second
set of string args is to test how codeset translators work with Anys, which
happens when the latter are passed as operation arguments.

The translation will occur on the side that takes the configuration file. If
you run either side with -ORBDebuglevel 10, you will see that when the client
is doing the translation the data in the message content dump is garbled and
when the server is translating the message content dump is clear.

To run with the client doing translation:
 ./Server &
 ./Client -orbsvcconf cs_test.conf

To run with the server doing translation:
 ./Server -orbsvcconf cs_test.conf
 ./Client

Replace cs_test.conf with wcs_test.conf to also use the UCS-4 to UTF-16
translator for wchar values.

The server dumps its IOR to a file: server.ior. Use catior -f server.ior
(from $TAO_ROOT/utils/catior) to see how the context information is added
to the profiles.
