@page EndpointPolicy Test README File

	This test bases on the simplest TAO test - Hello test and adds the 
	endpoint policy test in the server application. The server application 
	explicitly creates the POAManager with a valid endpoint policy, uses 
	the POAManager to create a poa and uses the poa to activate a servant. 
	This is to test the endpoint policy in the POAManager influences the 
	selection of endpoints to be used when collecting Profiles for use 
	in Object References. 
	
	In addition, the server application also tests some error conditions
	such as an inappropriate policy is supplied to a new POAManager.


	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  or start the client and the server manually:

$ server -o $iorfile -p $port -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost:$port &
$ client -k file://$iorfile
