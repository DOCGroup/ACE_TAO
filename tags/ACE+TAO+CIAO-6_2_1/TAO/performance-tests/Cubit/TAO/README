There are three versions of the Cubit example. Individual README files
in the respective directories explain these versions in further
detail.

        . IDL_Cubit

                 Cubit example with tao_idl compiler generated stubs
                 and skeletons

        . MT_Cubit

		 Multithreaded real-time Cubit example.

        . DII_Cubit

                 Cubit example with hand-generated stubs.  When
                 TAO supports the DII interface this will
                 illustrate how it works.
