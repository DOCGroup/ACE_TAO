<HR><P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Libraries in TAO</H3></P>

<H3>Overview</H3>

As part of the <a href="minimumTAO.html">subsetting effort</a> to
reduce footprint of applications using TAO, we have created different
libraries that house various CORBA features, such the POA and
DynamicAny.  This design helps minimize application footprint, only
linking in features that are required.  However, applications must
link in the libraries they need.  It is possible to load most of these
libraries dynamically using the ACE Service Configurator framework,
though this will not work for statically linked executables.  Linking
the necessary libraries with your application is therefore the most
straightforward way to get the features you need.

<H3> List of Libraries </H3>

Here we outline the list of libraries in TAO core with the list of <a
href="../../MPC/docs/README"> MPC </a> projects that can be used by the
application to get all the required libraries linked into the
application.  The library names in table below are the ones created on
UNIX based systems.  Windows systems have a slightly different naming
convention, e.g., the PortableServer library is named as
PortableServerd.lib and PortableServerd.dll. But for the naming
conventions used on different platforms, the contents of the libraries
and the dependencies outlined below are the same. <P>
