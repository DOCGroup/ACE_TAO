Case 1:
------

With a single name server, the test app is run.  As compiled the test
app:

	- get the root context
	- binds a new context ("MyContext"), returning the new
	  context's pointer.
	- binds a name ("MyName") into this context.
	- resolves the compound name ("MyContext;MyName").

This works great.

Case 2:
------

Again with a single server.  The test app is compiled to:

	- binds a new context ("MyContext").
	- binds the compound name ("MyContext;MyName") into the
	  root context.
	- resolves the compount name ("MyContext;MyName").

This fails.  The naming server raises the exception...

   Servant raised exception: 
   (8694|1) EXCEPTION, detected in POA::dispatch
   (8694|1) user exception, ID \
		'IDL:CosNaming/NamingContext/AlreadyBound:1.0'

Case 3:
------

Now we have 2 servers running.  One Name Server is the root context
server.  The other server is the "MyContext" server, and binds its
context into the root server at startup.  The Name Servers are started
as follows:

	Naming_Server -ORBport 0 &
	Naming_Server -ORBport 0 -NScontextname MyContext &

The test app is compiled to:

	- get the root context
	- resolve the context ("MyContext"), returning the
	  context's pointer
	- binds a name ("MyName") into this context.
	- resolve the compound name ("MyContext;MyName).

This works great.

Case 4:
-------

Same as case 2, but with 2 servers.  As expected, it fails
identically, raising the same exception.
