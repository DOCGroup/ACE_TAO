# This is for the HP-UX 10.x and 11.x using the aC++ compiler.
#
# For 10.x, most of the difference for threaded vs. non-threaded is
# contained in ace/config-hpux-10.x.h.  However, there is a line to verify
# in this file - if you are using DCE threads, "-lcma" needs to be on the
# 10.x version of the LIBS line, below.  If you are not using DCE threads,
# then use the LIBS without -lcma.
#
# HP-UX 11 supports both 32-bit and 64-bit builds, regardless of which
# architecture the build is done on.  This file is set up to build native
# to the machine it's running on.  To cross-build for another platform, add
# the appropriate +DA switch to CCFLAGS.
