Description:

This test makes sure that:

- For POAs using the default thread pool, the user can continue to use
-ORBEndpoint option.

- Makes sure that if the user tries to combine thread pools and
persistence, an InvalidPolicy exception is thrown.

- Makes sure that for POAs using thread pools, the user can specify
the protocol selection, protocol version, and other protocol specific
options (basically everything other than the endpoint address)
through the -ORBEndpoint option.
