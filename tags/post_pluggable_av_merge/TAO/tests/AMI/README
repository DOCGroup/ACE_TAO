Description:

This is a simple test for AMI callback model.

$ server -o test.ior
$ client -k file://test.ior -n 4 -i 1000

simple-client:
=============

$ simple_client -k file://test_ior [-i <niterations] [-x] [-d] \
     -ORBSvcConf {simple-client-muxed.conf,
                  simple-client-exclusive.conf}

-d Enable debug messages.
-i Number of iterations.
-k IOR.
-x Call shutdown method.

Issues <i> number of asynchronous requests. Then it issues a
synchronous request, which collects the replies.

If you choose Muxed Transport configuration, then the synchronous
request  will collect all the asynchronous replies also, since the
replies will arrive in order. 

But in the Exclusive Transport, the synchronous request might now
collect all the AMI replies. It might return as soon as its reply
arrives.
