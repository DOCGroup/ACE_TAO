@page DII Test README File

	The goals of writing this test are:

- Test all possible variations of DII calling schemes:
  o Synchronous twoway DII (i.e. using Request::invoke)
  o Deferred twoway DII (i.e. using Request::send_deferred/Request::get_response)
  o Deferred twoway DII with polling (i.e. using Request::send_deferred/Request::poll_response)
  o Oneway DII (i.e. using Request::send_oneway)
  
	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
