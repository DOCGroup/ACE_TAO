This program obtains the name of the Root POA.

Run the application as follows.

% RootPOA

Comments:
========

- It prints out the name of the Root POA.

- It prints out two warning messages, since there is no Resource Factory  and Strategy Factory
  found in the Service Repository.

  So, it takes the default instances of the Resource and Strategy Factories.

  This is ok for this simple application.
