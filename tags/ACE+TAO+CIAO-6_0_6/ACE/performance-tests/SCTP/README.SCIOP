The SCIOP pluggable protocol for TAO uses the SCTP transport protocol through
the use of the SOCK_SEQPACK ACE wrappers for sequence based transport.  The
current implementation supported is the OpenSS7 SCTP protocol layer, tested
under Linux 2.4.18.

For more information on SOCK_SEQPACK and OpenSS7 SCTP see
ACE_wrappers/performance-tests/SCTP/README*

Features Currently Supported:
-----------------------------

o) Sequenced delivery via SOCK_SEQPACK
Currently, only one stream is supported as there are no available bindings to
provide a user with stream designation for messages.

o) SCIOR compliance to OMG GIOP SCTP Protocol Mapping submission mars/2002-09-01.  

o) Multiple address SCIOR profiles
When multiple addresses are included in a SCIOR profile, each address is
handled separately during the connection process.  Specifying multiple
addresses for a single connection attempt remains as work to be done.
However, multiple path discovery during connection time in OpenSS7's
SCTP implementation has been tested to work properly with SCIOP.

The catior utility under ACE_wrappers/TAO/utils/catior has also modified
to display SCIOR profile information.

To test SCIOP after installing an SCTP implementation supported by
SOCK_SEQPACK, try using a performance test specifying an sciop address as the
ORBEndpoint.  One way to do this is with the test found under:
ACE_wrappers/TAO/performance-tests/Pluggable/

Make sure to build the pluggable protocols into the executable:
gmake LIBS+=-lTAO_Strategies

Run the server with an sciop endpoint specified:
./server -ORBEndpoint sciop://${HOSTNAME} -o test.ior &

Finally, run the client on the same machine or another that has file
access to your IOR file:
./client -f test.ior

TO-DO:
------

o) Multiple association connection using Multihomed_INET_Addr
Currently, only one address connection is attempted at a time, even when a
profile contains multiple address.  Later, we hope to allow this
implementation of SCIOP to exploit the multiple address connection
capabilities of STCP.

o) SCTP ProtocolManagement/SCTPProtocolProperties

o) Support for max_streams > 1

o) SCIOR Profile Components
