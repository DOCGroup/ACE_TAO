This test make sure that the collocation scheme works fine in case
of diamond shaped multiple inheritance.  The case taken into account
is the following:

                      Top
                     /   \
                 Left     Right
                     \   /
                    Bottom

The IDL file Multiple.idl, defines four IDL interface that satisfy
the relation expressed by the former figure.

The test is designed in such a way that error caused by the wrong
behaviour are detected and signaled.

To run the test you can do the following:

D:\Devel\ACE_wrappers\TAO\tests\Multiple>Client.exe


$ run_test.pl

-or-

$ server
$ client

In this case the the ORB will use *ThruPOA* collocation for non RT-CORBA
applications.

$ server -ORBCollocationStrategy direct
$ client

In this case the ORB will use *Direct* collocation for non RT-CORBA
applications.

$ server -ORBCollocation no
$ client

Collocation is disabled in this case.

The right output of the client should in any case be the one outlined
below. Anyhow the test is self checking so it will detect wrong answer
caused by weirdness in the collocation.
