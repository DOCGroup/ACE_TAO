Description:
This is a simple test for AMI callback model.

Note:
Use TAO_HAS_CORBA_MESSAGING
and TAO_HAS_AMI_CALLBACK
to compile TAO. This enables the AMI code in it.

Use -GC on the TAO IDL compiler to generate code for AMI callbacks.

Usage:
=====
$ server -o ior
$ simple_client -ORBSvcConf muxed.conf -k file://ior -i 10

simple-client:
=============

$ simple_client -k file://test_ior [-i <niterations] [-x] [-d] \
     -ORBSvcConf {muxed.conf,
                  exclusive.conf}

-d Enable debug messages.
-i Number of iterations.
-k IOR.
-x Call shutdown method.

Issues <i> number of asynchronous requests. Then it issues a
synchronous request, which collects the replies.

If you choose Muxed Transport configuration, then the synchronous
request will collect all the asynchronous replies also, since the
replies will arrive in order.  In the Exclusive Transport, however,
the synchronous request might not collect all the AMI replies.
Instead, it might return as soon as its reply arrives.
