This program tests the basic FT IOGR implementation. The aim is to set
a primary server and see whether the client gives preference to
contact a primary for its first invocation. When the primary is killed
it contacts the secondary for next invocation.

Two copies of the server are started. A manager is then to merge these
two iors and designate the  second as primary. The merged IOR is then
written to another file. This merged IOR is then used to make
invocations on the server.


Run the application as follows:

$./server -o <file1.ior>
$./server -o <file2.ior>
$./Manager -a file://<file1.ior> -b file://<file2.ior> -c <output.ior>

Due to teh transparent reinvocation functaionality for FT CORBA, the
application would switch to the new profile without throwing an
exception to the application.
