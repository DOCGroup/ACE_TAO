// DESCRIPTION        : Description of the Ior Parser

The "parseIor" utility parses IORs generated by most ORBs. It has been
tested with Orbix, VisiBroker and TAO so far.

USAGE: parseIor <IOR filename>

There is a sample file in this directory called TaoSimple.IOR that is
an IOR generated using the example $TAO_ROOT/tests/Simple.  You can
run the "parseIor" utility against that to see what the output looks
like.
