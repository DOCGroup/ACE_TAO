This directory contains a battery of tests that exercise all the
functionality of ACE on Win32 and UNIX.  These tests can be executed
in a single pass via a shell script run_tests.sh (on UNIX) or a batch
file run_tests.bat (on Win32).

On UNIX, by default all the output from the tests will be stored in
separate files in the ./log/ directory.  However, you can override
this by setting the ACE_TEST_DIR environment variable to another
prefix.  On Win32 all the output is stored in separate files in
C:\temp\log\.

________________________________________

Please follow these directions when adding a new test to
$ACE_ROOT/tests:

1.  Use appropriate ACE_START_TEST and ACE_END_TEST macros in main ()
2.  Add test to Makefile
3.  Add test to MS project files (tests.dsp and version_tests/version_tests.dsp)
    (... and tests.mdp and version_tests/version_tests.mdp (for MSVC 4.2))
4.  Add test to all or most of these:

    run_tests.bat, run_tests.psosim, run_tests.sh, and run_tests.vxworks.
________________________________________

The tests have been run on UNIX, pSOS, Windows NT, and Windows 95 and they
all work with the following exceptions:

1. Name_Server_Test on Windows 95: this does not work on Windows 95
   since Windows 95 has a different model for shared memory and does
   not support explicitly selecting shared memory addresses.

2. UPIPE_Test and SPIPE_Test on Windows 95: these do not work on
   Windows 95 since Windows 95 does not support the server side
   functionality of accepting connections from clients using named pipes.

3. Proactor_Test (to be added) on Windows 95: this does not work on
   Windows 95 since Windows 95 does not support I/O completion ports.

4. Of the tests (believed) relevant to the single threaded port to pSOSim,
   Sigset_Ops_Test, Sock_Connector_Test, Priority_Reactor_Test,
   Process_Strategy_Test, and Service_Config_Test are still failing.
   These are being debugged and will either be corrected or, if there
   are unsupported features in these tests, removed from the test suite for
   pSOSim.

5. The set of tests for pSOSim will be expanded to include those that require
   multiple threads, with the release of the multi-threaded port to pSOSim.

Notes:

1. Each test creates a log file and writes it to the ./log/
   directory. The log directory can be changed in the test_config.h
   file.

2. Each log file contains a time stamp of when the test began and also
   a time stamp indicating when the test ended. If the ending time stamp
   is missing, you can assume that the test did not succeed.

3. None of the tests require any command line parameters. This is in
   accordance with the keeping the test-suite a "one-button" test. If
   any of the tests require any variable parameters these are
   specified in test_config.h.

4. Time_Service_Test executes the Time Server and Clerk components as
   two processes and so the executable "main" need to be present in
   the netsvcs/servers directory.  Be sure you build
   $ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/lib/ and $ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers before running
   this test.  These components rely on config files. Two sample
   config files are also present in the test-suite, namely
   UNIXserver.conf and UNIXclerk.conf (and for Win32, Win32server.conf
   and Win32clerk.conf).

Please see run_tests.vxworks for information on the status of
tests on VxWorks.

Please see run_tests.psosim for information on the status of tests on pSOSim.
Run_tests.psosim is an executable shell script that runs all tests that are
(believed) relevant to the single threaded port to pSOSim.
