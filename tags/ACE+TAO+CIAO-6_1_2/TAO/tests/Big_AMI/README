Description:
This is a simple test for testing big AMI calls.

At the moment we do very huge AMI calls, then the send
could block at transport level. At that moment the data we want
to send if buffered and we should return control to the application
without waiting until all data is send. We test this by doing
several big AMI calls and check whether we didn't receive any
replies, the replies should return at the moment we just run
the ORB but not between the AMI calls themselves.

This problem will not appear on fast systems that have client
and server locally, it will appear when client and server are
on different boxes but that is something we don't test with our
normal builds.
