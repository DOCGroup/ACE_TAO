Migrating from BOA to POA

Client side:
<ul>
<li>Very little has changed, and some have not needed any changes.</li>
<li>You'll have to insure that the Makefile includes .o's for both the server
and client; this is necessary to support collocation.</li>
</ul>

Server side:
<li>POA_init() is replaced with resolve_initial_references("RootPOA") followed
by a _narrow operation.</li
<li>The implementation no longer inherits from the client-side stub; they
inherit from PortableServer::ServantBase.  The implications of this are (a) if
you want a object reference for that, you must use the _this() method.</li>
<li>Object ID's are assigned by the POA unless you activate the servant with a
specific ID; IDL_Cubit has examples on how to do this.</li>
<li>Unlike the BOA, the POA explicitly addresses the temporal nature of servants
and declares that a POA can service either transient or persistent servants
(not both).  The root POA's (mandated, unchangeable) policy is "transient". 
The implications of this are that in order for a client to be able to
manufacture an object reference on its own and use that to access an object,
the servant for that object must be registered with a POA whose policy is
"persistent".  Thus, you must create a child POA with that policy and register
the servant with that POA.  NOTE: when the POA declares something as
"persistent", it is only stating that the key is valid between different runs
of the server; it makes no claims that state or anything else is persistent.</li

<ul>
	<li> Servants are not automatically activated, hence you must register 
	them by calling some of the activate_object* methods on a POA or 
	calling _this() on the servant; with the latest you have no control on 
	the ObjectId (which sometimes is good), and the POA must support the 
	right policies (the RootPOA does).</li>
    
	<li>Servant constructors use to take a <const char*> parameter to set 
	they object id, this is not needed now, in fact in many cases they use 
	to pass this argument to the skeleton class: this will fail now.</li>
</ul>
This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but should give you a good
starting point.  If you find things along the way which have to change and I
didn't note them, please send them to me.  Perhaps we can work together on the
ultimate migration document.
