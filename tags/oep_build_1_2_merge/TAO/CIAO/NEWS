USER VISIBLE CHANGES BETWEEN CIAO-0.3.6 and CIAO-0.4
====================================================

. Added Makefiles to build the ciao and tools subdirs by default.

. The suport for the following IDL features have been added to the
  CIDL since the last beta

  - exception (exception declaration and raises() specification)
  - valuetype
  - enum
  - const declaration
  - const expression and literals
  - native
  - home finder
  - oneway operation
  - readonly attribute
  - type declaration inside interfaces, valuetypes

  though we plan to add this support over the next several months,
