This directory contains a freely available software distributed
real-time MPEG video and audio player, for use across the
Internet. Please install it, run it, play movies and music, and have
fun !

The player features common VCR functionalities like synchronized video
and audio play back, play speed change on the fly, fast-forward, rewind,
step forward, random Positioning, and more.

This version of the player plays MPEG1 video (elementary stream) and
Sun Sparc format (mu-law) audio. It does not play MPEG1 system streams
or MPEG2 streams yet.

The player is of server/client architecture, with audio/video servers
and a client distributed across the Internet. The server manages audio
video file retrieval and distribution. The client decodes video
frames, plays video and audio streams, and provides a Motif style user
interface.

The servers stream out media data to clients, so there is NO NEED to
download all bits beforehand.

Some important characteristics of Internet are resource sharing,
highly dynamic workload, no resource reservation facility, and lack of
a common clock.  This player uses novel software feedback mechanisms
to synchronize servers and clients, and to adapt playback quality to
the current Internet workload.


As compared to version 1.0, this version has following improvements:

	- UDP/TCP video audio data connection choice
	- support of both native audio device and AudioFile
	- client invocable from web browser
	- better organized source code tree
	- bug fix
	- and more...


The player has been compiled and tested on following architectures:

	HP-UX 09.03
	SunOS 4.1.3_U1 (sparc)
	Solaris 2.3 (sparc)
	Solaris 2.4 (i86pc)
	Solaris 2.4 (sparc)
	Ultrix 4.x
	FreeBSD 2.0.5
	LINUX 1.3

If you decide to port the player to a new architecture, please let
us know so that we can incorporate the changes into our sources.


The player is publicly available via anonymous ftp from:

  ftp.cse.ogi.edu (129.29.20.2) in /pub/dsrg/Player/

or through following WWW pointer:

  http://cse.ogi.edu/DISC/projects/synthetix/Player/

To install the player, ftp file vcr.tar.Z to local host, move it to a
suitable directory (best to create a new directory for this software),
uncompress and untar the .Z file, and see INSTALL for instructions.
Following is an example of steps to ftp and untar the package:

	% mkdir vcr
	% cd vcr
	% ftp ftp.cse.ogi.edu
	*** login as anonymous and your email address as passwd ***
	ftp> cd pub/dsrg/Player
	ftp> binary
	ftp> get README
	ftp> get vcr.tar.Z
	ftp> quit
	% gunzip vcr.tar.Z (or you may also use 'uncompress vcr.tar.Z')
	% tar xf vcr.tar

Binary code for platforms HPUX, Solaris 2.4 for x86, Solaris 2.x for
Sparc, SunOS4.1.3 and FreeBSD are also available in directory
/pub/dsrg/Player/binaries/.

We would highly appreciate it if you can share with us the performance
result you get when you play movies retrieved from the OGI
server. Please let us know following information:

	- The platform you use for the client.

	- How many hops from your site to OGI, and what is the
	  estimated bandwidth,

	- Which picture size (320x240, 256x192, 128x96 or 64x48)
	  works best for you, and on average how many
	  frames-per-second can be displayed.

	- Questions, comments, suggestions, and bug report.

Information can also be sent to: scen@cse.ogi.edu  Thank you!

We gratefully thank ARPA and the National Science Foundation for their
financial support, and thank Tektronix, Hewlett-Packard and the
Portland Trail Blazers for their donations.

We also want to thank following people for their code:

  Lawrence A. Rowe, Ketan Patel, and Brian Smith of Computer Science
  Division-EECS, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley.  The MPEG decoder used by
  the client of the player is originated from their MPEG decoder 2.0
