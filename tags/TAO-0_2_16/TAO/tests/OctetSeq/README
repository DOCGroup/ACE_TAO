# $Id$

	This test measures the time it takes to marshal sequences of
octets of different sizes. Since TAO optimizes octet sequence
marshaling it was interesting to compare that time with the time to
marshal sequences of chars (which could be optimized also, but there
is no need for it).

	The test accepts a few options:

	-l <low>
		Sets the minimum size of the sequences tested.

	-h <high>
		The maximum size of the sequences tested.

	-s <step>
		Increase the size of the sequence from <low> to <high>
		in increments of <step>

	-n <iter>
		The number of iterations (marshaling/demarshaling)
		done for each loop.
