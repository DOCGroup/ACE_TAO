In the previous tutorial we learned how to put text into a message queue.
While that may be useful, it isn't very exciting or realistic.  In most
cases you'll need to move complex data structures between your threads.
<P>
In this tutorial I'll expand the previous by moving not only a text string
but also a more complex object.  In the next tutorial I'll change things
again so that we move the complex object a bit more efficiently.

A simple abstract for a simple tutorial:
<UL>
In this tutorial, we put some data into the blocks of the message queue.
We copy the data from a Data object into the block and put it on the
queue. The block is then dequeued by the thread which picks it up and
processes it. This tutorial is very similar to the previous
one with the extra touch being population of the blocks with data.

(Abstract by Kirthika, as always.)
