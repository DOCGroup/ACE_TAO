CatIOR is a small utility that takes in a stringified IOR and decode
it, printing out the information contained in it.

Usage
-----

catior -f <filename>

Takes in a file which contains the IOR and will then output the 
encoded information to stdout.

There is a sample file in this directory called TaoSimple.IOR that is
an IOR generated using the example $TAO_ROOT/tests/Simple.  You can
run the "catior" utility against that to see what the output looks
like.
