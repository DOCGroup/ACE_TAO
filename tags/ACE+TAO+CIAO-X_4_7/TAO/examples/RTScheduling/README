Pluggable  Schedulers
=====================

The Real-Time CORBA 2.0 specification provides interfaces for a  framework that facilitates dynamic scheduling in distributed real-time systems. The specification introduces the following concepts:

* Scheduling Segment - A sequence of code, on a single host, with
specific scheduling requirements
* Distributable Thread (DT) - A programming model abstraction for a
distributed task
* Pluggable Scheduler - Facilitate the use of multiple scheduling
disciplines
* Scheduling Points - To interact with the scheduler at the
application and ORB level

This dir contains two pluggable schedulers:

Fixed Priority Scheduler - This scheduler uses the OS scheduler to
schedule the various  DTs dynamically entering and leaving the
system. The DTs are scheduled based on their importance.

Most Important First (MIF) Scheduler - This scheduler uses a custom
MIF scheduler to schedule the DTs in the system. The tasks are
scheduled according to their importance. The scheduler maintains a
ready queue of DTs. When a DT enters the system it puts the DT in the
ready queue in order of its importance. It then activates the DT
of highest importance in the ready queue. So at any given time the
DT with the highest importance is running.
