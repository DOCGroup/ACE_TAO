# Configuration file that the gatewayd process uses to determine which
# Consumers will receive events from which Suppliers.  For now, the
# Gateway only allows Consumers to "subscribe" to receive events from
# particular Suppliers.  A more flexible implementation will allow
# Consumers to subscribe to particular types of events, as well.
#
# The following provides an explanation for the fields in this file,
# and how they relate to fields in the corresponding "connection_config"
# file. 
#
# 1. Connection ID -- Each Connection Handler is given a unique ID
#    that is used in the "consumer_config" file to specify to which
#    Consumers the Event Channel will forward incoming events from
#    Suppliers.  The Connection ID field is the "key" that is used to
#    match up Consumer subscription requests in this file with 
#    connections in the "connection_config" file.
#
# 2. Event Type -- Indicates the type of the event.  Consumers
#    can use this to only subscribe to certain types of events.  
#    This feature is currently not implemented.
#
# 3. Consumers -- Indicates which Consumers will receive events sent
#    from this Proxy/Supplier ID, i.e., Consumers can subscribe to
#    receive events from particular Suppliers.  Note that more than
#    one Consumer can subscribe to the same Supplier event, i.e.,
#    we support logical "multicast" (which is currently implemented
#    using multi-point unicast via TCP/IP).
