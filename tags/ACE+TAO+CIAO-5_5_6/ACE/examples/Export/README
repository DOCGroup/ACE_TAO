The Export example is just an example that both shows off and tests
the macros created by generate_export_file.pl (or the earlier
GenExportH.bat).  These macros are used to properly export functions
and classes from a Win32 DLL.  On other platforms these macros expand
to nothing (since shared objects just export everything).
