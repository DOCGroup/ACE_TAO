================================================================
Configuring ACE Using the `configure' Script
================================================================

QuickStart
----------
GNU Autoconf support in ACE is still under development.  However it is
a small subset of Autoconf support in ACE has been made available for
testing and feedback purposes.  To use Autoconf support in ACE, do
something like the following:

    cd ACE_wrappers
    mkdir objdir
    cd objdir

Then:
    Bourne Shell:   CXX=c++ ../configure
    C Shell:        env CXX=c++ ../configure
make

Description
-----------
To help speed development, the work being done by the ACE
Configuration Project is being slowly introduced into the official ACE
distribution.  Some of the functionality in the work created by the
ACE Configuration Project has been removed so that ACE may be built in
the usual fashion.  Once the ACE Configuration Project work stabilizes
on more platforms that removed functionality may be added to ACE.

Currently the configure script contains most of the tests that are
necessary to properly configure ACE on most platforms.  However, there
are still some autoconf tests that are missing.  As such, you may
encounter and most likely will have compilation problems.  Please
report any problems to the contacts listed at the end of this
document.

The `configure' script that is currently being used has been modified
from the ACE Configuration Project's `configure' script to prevent
makefiles from being automatically generated since there are still
some issues that must be addressed before automatically generated
makefiles are incorporated into the official ACE distribution.

A listing of available configure script options can be shown by
entering:

	./configure --help

at the command line.  The output should look something like the
following:

To enable debugging and disable code inlining, for example, just enter
the following on the command line:

	./configure --enable-debug --disable-inline

This will generate a configuration header file `ace/config.h' to be
used when compiling ACE that will enable ACE debugging macros and
disable code inlining during compilation of ACE.

Once the `ace/config.h' header has been created you will have to
select a platform macros file.  Please read the ACE installation
documents for more information about this.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Caveats
----------------------------------------------------------------
The `configure' script will check for libraries that contain certain
functions. If it finds a library that isn't listed in your
platform_macros.GNU file you will have to add that library to the list
of libraries to link against.

Shared library generation when using ACE Autoconf support is different
from the stock ACE shared library generation mechanism.  The Autoconf
supported shared library mechanism does not yet fully support all of
the platforms ACE's stock shared library mechanism supports.  As such,
you may encounter problems if an attempt is made to build a shared
library when using ACE's autoconf support.

Remember that the stock ACE build procedure is always available.  If
your attempts to use ACE's Autoconf support are unsuccessful then
contact the parties listed below, and use ACE stock build procedure as
described in ACE-INSTALL.html.
