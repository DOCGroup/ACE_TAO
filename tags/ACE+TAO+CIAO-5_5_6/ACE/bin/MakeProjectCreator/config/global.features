// The global features file contains the default feature settings.
// By default, if a feature isn't listed here then it is enabled.
// If it is listed, then the value assigned to the feature is interpreted
// as a boolean value.  You really shouldn't have to edit this file except
// to change the defaults.  If you want to override these values you can do
// one of two things.
//
// 1) Create a default.features in this directory with the features you
//    want enabled or disabled.
// 2) Create a feature file anywhere you like with the features you want and
//    use the -feature_file option to specify where it is located.
//
// Feature definitions from this file are always overwritten by -features
// command option of mwc.pl.
//
// This file is somewhat akin to the platform_macros.GNU file in that build
// settings can be set here.

// Enable these by default.

// Features for various GUI libraries

// Some of features are switched on because they are also controlled
// by higher level features eg. gl is 1 because it is necessary for fl,
// but if someone turns on fl, we may assume gl is available. This way makefile
// generation is simplified. Moreover all internal ACE features like ace_qtreactor
// and tao_qtresource are also turn on, because we want to build every component
// related with qt if qt is provided. It is proposed to not remove
// switched on features from global.features just because features are available
// by default. This file is also a kind of ACE capabilities documentation, hence
// it is better to enumerate here all features recognized by ACE.
