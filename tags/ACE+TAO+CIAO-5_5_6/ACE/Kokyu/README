Kokyu is a portable middleware scheduling framework designed to
provide flexible scheduling and dispatching services within the
context of higher-level middleware. Kokyu currently provides real-time
scheduling and dispatching services for TAO's real-time Event Service
which mediates supplier-consumer relationships between application
operations. Kokyu also provides a scheduling and dispatching framework
for threads. This is being used by the TAO RTCORBA 1.2 scheduler
implementations. For more information, see

ACE_wrappers/Kokyu/docs/Kokyu.html

To build Kokyu on Windows, open the workspace
$ACE_ROOT/Kokyu/Kokyu.dsw and build it.

An mpc file has also been provided - $ACE_ROOT/Kokyu/Kokyu.mpc from
which IDE specific build files can be generated.
