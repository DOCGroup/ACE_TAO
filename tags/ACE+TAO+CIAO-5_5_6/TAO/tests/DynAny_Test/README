This is a semi-complete run-through of DynAny functionality.
To run a test, type

basic_test -t <dynany|dynarray|dynenum|dynsequence|dynstruct|dynunion> -d

To save on output, several things are tested in one pass. For each
pass, a message is displayed, for example:

"testing: constructor from any/insert/get"     or
"testing: constructor from typecode/from_any/to_any"

and finally an error count for the entire test.

Each DynAny is analyzed to make sure its contents is ok. With the option -d
this analys is also dumped to the output
