RT Notification test to verify lane support
===========================================
This test makes sure that events are send according to the lanes
configured on the evnt channel.

Description:
===========

notify.conf:
-----------
The notify.conf file specifies the Test Filter Factory to be used by
the RT Notification library.
The Test Filter factory create special filter objects. these objects
check if the correct lane is being used for invocations.


supplier.conf:
-------------

An event channel is created with 4 lanes. The lowest priority lane (0 in
continuous mapping) is used to handle the administrative invocations
by the driver program. 3 other lanes are used to handle 3 different
event flow "paths" in the event channel.

3 Periodic suppliers are created. Each supplier is configured to
operate in its lane.

consumer.conf:
------------

An RT POA is created with 4 lanes (identical to the one setup on the
eventchannel).

3 Periodic consumers and created and activated in the local RT POA.

Expected Result:
==============
if a request reaches a Lane that it was not supposed to, an
error message is printed. otherwise some housekeeping messages are
generated when the test runs.
