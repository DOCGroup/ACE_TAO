This test verifies that the ORB's secure invocation mechanism is
functioning properly.  It does so by the doing the following:

	- Invoking a request over standard (insecure) IIOP on a target
	  object that requires secure invocation (e.g. over SSLIOP).
	  The client should receive a CORBA::NO_PERMISSION exception.

	- Invoking a request via a security mechanism, such as
	  SSLIOP.  The AccessId associated with the given request is
	  obtained from the SecurityCurrent object, and displayed.

The expected test output is the following:
