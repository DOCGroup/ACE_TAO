This test verifies that the "PICurrent" object semantics are correct
on both the client side and the server side.  In particular, it
attempts to make sure the request scope current (RSC) and thread scope
current (TSC) copying semantics are correct when transitioning between
the two scopes on both the client and server sides.  This is
accomplished by setting and getting elements of different types in the
RSC and TSC slot tables at various points during the course of an
invocation.

Expected output is along the lines of the following:
