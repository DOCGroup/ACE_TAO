This is a simple CORBA example that has an object (simple_object) 
with only two methods, one that cubes a long and another that 
shuts down the server.  


server:
-------

server [-d] [-o <ior_output_file>] 

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag (It is additive more -d flags will give debugging).
-o    Outputs the cubit_factory ior file to the file

The server cubit factory maintains num_of_cubit objects (default =
1). They are assigned keys that look like "key0", "key1", ...

When the server is started, you should see as the first line of output 
something that looks like
      iiop:1.0//danzon.cs.wustl.edu:10015/P35ad159600081a38/child_poa/server
	(-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
	(-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  It is additive, i.e., the more
-d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the moment,
only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d options
are ignored.


client:
-------

client [-d] [-x] [-f cubit_factory_ior_file] [-n iterations]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag
-x    Tells the server to shutdown.
-f    Reads the cubit factory ior from the file
-n    no. of iterations
	
There is only one way of giving the CubitFactory IOR to the client, and
that is from a file using the -f option. (This file is produced using 
the -o option of the server.)
	
run_test.pl:
------------

This is a perl script which runs the server and client, and shuts down
the server when it is done.
