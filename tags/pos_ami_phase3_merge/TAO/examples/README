This directory contains a number of example applications that
illustrate how to program with standard CORBA using TAO.  The
individual directories contain READMEs on how to run the following
examples:

        . Borland 

          This directory illustrates how to write a Borland C++
          Builder application using ACE+TAO.

        . Callback_Quoter

          Illustrates how to implement distributed callbacks using
          TAO.

        . Event_Comm

          Another illustration of how to implement distributed
          callbacks using TAO.

        . Logging 

          This example implements a simple logging service using TAO.

        . POA

          Contains various small examples of POA features based on
          the OMG POA specification.

        . OBV

          This is a demonstration of the CORBA 2.3 valuetype feature from
          the Object-by-Value specification.

        . Quoter
        
          Illustrates how to use the Global POA options with multiple
          threads.  This example also shows how to use the Lifecycle
          service. 
                      
        . Simple
          
          Contains a number of simple CORBA examples, which also
          illustrate how to write canonical Orbix/VisiBroker/OmniORB
          examples in TAO using standard CORBA features rather than
          proprietary ORB features.

        . Simulator

          This is a demonstration of the TAO "Distributed Object
          Visualization Environment" (DOVE), which shows how the TAO
          Real-time Event Service can be used to transport monitoring
          events.
