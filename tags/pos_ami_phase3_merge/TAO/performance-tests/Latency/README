Description:

	This is a simple latency test, a server runs using a thread
pool reactor, the client creates several threads that send requests to 
the server and record latency and throughput statistics.

	Command line options on the client and server can be used to
control the number of threads in the server and the client, the amount
work performed on each request, the number of requests per thread,
etc.

Expected output:
	The server prints out the IOR of the object it serves. The
client prints the results on a per-thread basis as well as the
aggregated numbers.

How to run:
	You can use the run_test.pl script to run it or:

$ server -ORBSvcConf server.conf -n 2
$ client -ORBSvcConf client.conf -n 4 -i 1000
