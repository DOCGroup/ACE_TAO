        A simple test for timeouts.  The client sets each one of the
policy overrides (object, thread and ORB) and issues requests using
those policies.  The requests take a client controlled amount of time
on the server.

        As the client increases the duration of the request the
requests should start to timeout.

Please see the file README.expected_behavior for a more detailed
description of what to expect and what has been observed on real-time Linux and non real-time Linux operating systems.

        To run it do:

$ server -o test.ior
$ client -k file://test.ior -l 5 -h 15

        or use the run_test.pl script.
