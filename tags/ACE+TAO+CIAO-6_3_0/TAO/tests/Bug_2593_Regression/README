@page Bug 2593 Regression Test README File

This test is used to demonstrate that TAO can successfully connect
with a server even if the server's IOR contains profiles the client
doesn't know about.

When TAO 1.5.2 was released it was discovered that TAO could no longer
tolerate unknown profiles. This test is designed to ensure that
problem is caught before another release is cut.


$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
