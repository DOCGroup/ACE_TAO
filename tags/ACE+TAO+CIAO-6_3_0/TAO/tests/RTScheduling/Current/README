Case
----

This is a test of the various operations in the RTScheduling::Current
Interface used to create and manage DTs. Four DTs are created. The
following are the operations and cases tested:

1. Out of context end_scheduling_segment () invocation.
2. Out of context update_scheduling_segment () invocation.
3. Creation of DT's consisting of nested scheduling segments using
   begin_scheduling_segment () and end_scheduling_segment () operations.
4. Retreiving DT Guid with Current::id () method.
5. Listing the names of the scheduling segments using
   current_scheduling_segment_names ().

To Run
------

./test


Typical Output
--------------

Making an end_scheduling_segment call without first calling begin_scheduling_segment
Missing scheduling context OR DT cancelled
(10205|1024) EXCEPTION, End Scheduling Segment is out of context
system exception, ID 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/BAD_INV_ORDER:1.0'
TAO exception, minor code = 0 (unknown location; unspecified errno), completed = NO

Making an update_scheduling_segment call without first calling begin_scheduling_segment
(10205|1024) EXCEPTION, Update Scheduling Segment is out of context:
system exception, ID 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/BAD_INV_ORDER:1.0'
