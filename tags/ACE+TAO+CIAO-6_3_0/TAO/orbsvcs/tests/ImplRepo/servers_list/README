This test runs various servers registered with the ImR and verifies
that the number of servers returned by the tao_imr list command is
what is expected.

The test abruptly terminates a server and verifies that when only
listing the active servers (obtained by passing the -a option to list)
that the number returned is one less than the number of servers listed
before killing the server. Note that currently this verification will
fail if the activator is not used (passing -no_activator) because the
ImR always assumes that servers are alive in this case.

This test also illustrates that without passing the -a option to the
list command that all the servers registered with the ImR will be
shown whether or not they are active.
