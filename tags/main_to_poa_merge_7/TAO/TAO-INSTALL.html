<h3>Building and Installing TAO</h3>

TAO has been ported and tested Windows NT, Solaris, VxWorks, and
Linux.  I expect that major portions of the release will port easily
to other platforms that ACE has been ported to.  If you can help port
TAO to other platforms we'd appreciate it. <P>

TAO can be obtained <A HREF="TAO-obtain.html">electronically</A> via
the WWW and ftp.  Besides getting the <A
HREF="http://siesta.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-obtain.html">TAO
release</A> you will need <A
HREF="http://siesta.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-obtain.html">ACE</A>.
You will likely need the most recent <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/ACE.tar.gz">beta</a>
version of ACE because TAO tends to track changes to ACE rather
closely. <P>

A quick build note for users who have used ACE with other ORBs:
linking TAO with a version of ACE that must also be linked against
another ORB vendor's library, e.g., liborbix.so, will produce
undefined and most likely unpredictable and erroneous results. <P>

<h3>On UNIX platforms</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Set <code>ACE_ROOT</code> environment variable as outlined
      in the <a href="../ACE-INSTALL.html">ACE installation
      notes</a>.</li> <P>

      <li>Build and install ACE under <CODE>$ACE_ROOT</CODE>.</li> <P>

      <UL>
      <li>Change directory to <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace</code> and execute
      <code>make</code>.</li> <P>
      </UL>

      <li>Set <code>TAO_ROOT</code> environment variable to
           <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/TAO</CODE>. <P>

      <li>Build and install the TAO release under <CODE>$TAO_ROOT</CODE>.</li> <P>

      <UL>
      <li>Change directory to <code>$TAO_ROOT/tao</code> and
      execute <code>make</code>.</li> <P>
      </UL>

      <li>Change directory to <code>$TAO_ROOT/tests</code> and
      execute <code>make</code>.</li> <P>

      <li>Follow instructions on executing the various examples under
      <code>$TAO_ROOT/tests</code>.<P>

    </ol>

<H3>On Windows NT</H3>

Before compiling <CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> on NT, you may need to set the
environment variable <CODE>CPP_PATH</CODE> to where CL.exe is
installed on your machine.  By default, we set this variable to to
"C:/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin".  Your location may vary, however.
Notice that if you forget to set this variable, you must rebuild
<CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> after setting it. <P>

<H4>Visual C++ 5.0</H4>

<P>It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
<CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> because the Visual C++ 5.0 Project files
are set up to work in this configuration. If you move it, then make
sure you change the project file to look for the include and library
files in the correct place.</P>

<OL>
  <LI> Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 5.0, use ace.dsw or ace-vc50.dsw,
       whichever is in your copy of ACE). <BR><BR>

  <LI> Load the workspace <CODE>tao\TAO.dsw</CODE> and build the TAO library. <BR><BR>

  <LI> To build the Cubit test, load the workspace <CODE>tests\Cubit\TAO\test.dsw</CODE>
       and build both client and server. <BR><BR>
</OL>

<H4>Visual C++ 4.x</H4>

<OL>
  <LI> In Tools|Options, go to the Directories page and make sure that include
       files paths includes ACE_wrappers\ and the root directory of TAO (which
       can be <CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> if installed there).  The
library files paths
       should include <CODE>ACE_wrappers\ace</CODE>. <P>

  <LI> Load the project file <CODE>tao\TAO.mdp</CODE> and build the
TAO library. <P>

  <LI> To build the Cubit test, load the project file <CODE>tests\Cubit\TAO\test.mdp</CODE>
       and build both client and server. <P>
</OL>
