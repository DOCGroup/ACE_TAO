The ns_tree.cpp test application exercises various features of TAO's
Naming Service.  It behaves as follows:

	1. It binds a new context ("MyContext").
	2. It binds the compound name ("MyContext;MyName") into the
           root context.
	3. It resolves the compount name ("MyContext;MyName").

In this case, proper functioning of the hierarchical test implies
functioning of the "flat" test.

A collection of various tests selectable by command line arguments
will be available later.
