<h3>Building and Installing TAO</h3>

TAO has been ported and tested Windows NT, Solaris, VxWorks, and
Linux.  I expect that major portions of the release will port easily
to other platforms that ACE has been ported to.  If you can help port
TAO to other platforms I'd appreciate it. <P>

TAO can be obtained <A HREF="TAO-obtain.html">electronically</A> via
the WWW and ftp.  Besides getting the <A
HREF="http://siesta.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-obtain.html">TAO alpha
release</A> you will need <A
HREF="http://siesta.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-obtain.html">ACE</A>.
You will likely need the most recent beta version of ACE because TAO
tends to track changes to ACE rather closely. <P>

A quick build note for users who have used ACE with other ORBs:
linking TAO with a version of ACE that must also be linked against
another ORB vendor's library, e.g., liborbix.so, will produce
undefined and most likely unpredictable and erroneous results. <P>

<h3>On UNIX platforms</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Set <code>ACE_ROOT</code> environment variable as outlined
      in the <a href="../ACE-INSTALL.html">ACE installation
      notes</a>.</li> <P>

      <li>Build and install ACE under $ACE_ROOT.</li> <P>

      <UL>
      <li>Change directory to <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace</code> and execute
      <code>make</code>.</li> <P>
      </UL>

      <li>Set <code>TAO_ROOT</code> environment variable to
           $ACE_ROOT/TAO. <P>

      <li>Build and install the TAO release under $TAO_ROOT.</li> <P>

      <UL>
      <li>Change directory to <code>$TAO_ROOT/tao</code> and
      execute <code>make</code>.</li> <P>
      </UL>

      <li>Change directory to <code>$TAO_ROOT/tests</code> and
      execute <code>make</code>.</li> <P>

      <li>Follow instructions on executing the various examples under
      <code>$TAO_ROOT/tests</code>.<P>

    </ol>

<H3>On Windows NT</H3>

Before compiling TAO_IDL on NT, you must set the environment variable
CPP_PATH to where CL.exe is installed on your machine.  E.g. on our
    machines, we set it to "C:/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin".  Yours
    may vary.  Notice that if you forget to set this variable, you
    must rebuild TAO_IDL after setting it.

<H4>Visual C++ 5.0</H4>

<P>It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
ACE_wrappers\TAO because the Visual C++ 5.0 Project files are set up to work
in this configuration. If you move it, then make sure you change the project
file to look for the include and library files in the correct place.</P>

<OL>
  <LI> Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 5.0, use ace.dsw or ace-vc50.dsw,
       whichever is in your copy of ACE). <BR><BR>

  <LI> Load the workspace tao\TAO.dsw and build the TAO library. <BR><BR>

  <LI> To build the Cubit test, load the workspace tests\Cubit\TAO\test.dsw
       and build both client and server. <BR><BR>
</OL>

<H4>Visual C++ 4.x</H4>

<OL>
  <LI> In Tools|Options, go to the Directories page and make sure that include
       files paths includes ACE_wrappers\ and the root directory of TAO (which
       can be ACE_wrappers\TAO if installed there).  The library files paths
       should include ACE_wrappers\ace. <P>

  <LI> Load the project file tao\TAO.mdp and build the TAO library. <P>

  <LI> To build the Cubit test, load the project file tests\Cubit\TAO\test.mdp
       and build both client and server. <P>
</OL>
