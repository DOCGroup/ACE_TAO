<A NAME="name-overview">
<H3> Overview of Naming Service</H3>

A Naming Service associates names with values in a distributed
system. Clients can query these values using these names as keys. Such
a name-to-value association is called a <I> Name Binding </I>. Name
bindings are defined relative to a <I> Naming Context </I>. A naming
context is a collection that contains a set of name bindings in which
each name is unique. Different names can be bound to the same value in
the same or different naming contexts at the same time. There are
three types of naming contexts: <P>

<OL>
<LI> Process Local Naming Context: Name bindings are accessible from
processes with the same name running on the same host. <P>
<LI> Node Local Naming Context: Name bindings are accessible from all
processes running on the same host. <P>
<LI> Network Local Naming Context: Name bindings are accessible from
all processes running on any machine within a (sub)network. <P>
</OL>

<P>
To bind a name is to create a name binding in a given context.
Querying a value using a name determines the value associated with the
name in a given context. Note that a name is always bound relative to
a context. Thus, there are no absolute names. <P>

The following are the key classes in the ACE Naming Service: <P>

<UL>
<LI> <B><TT> Class Naming_Context </TT></B> <P>

This is the main class ``entry point'' into the Naming Service. It is
used both by client processes and by server process. It manages access
to the appropriate Name/Binding database (that is the file where
Name/Bindings are stored) and it also manages the communication
between a client process and the server (by using class Name_Proxy,
which is a private member of Naming_Context).  If a client process
runs on the same host as the server no IPC is necessary because the
Naming_Context uses shared memory. <P>

<LI> <B><TT> Class Name_Acceptor </TT></B> <P>

The Name_Acceptor allocates in its handle_input() routine a new
instance of class Name_Handler on the heap, and accepts connections
into this Name_Handler. <P>

<LI> <B><TT> Class Name_Handler </TT></B> <P>

The class Name_Handler represents the server side of communication
between client and server. It interprets incoming requests to the
Net_Local namespace and delegates the requests to its own
Naming_Context (which is the Net_Local namespace on the current
host). For communication it uses the helper classes Name_Request and
Name_Reply.<P>

<LI> <B> Dependencies </B> <P>

The ACE Naming Service uses ACE_WString String classes since it must
handle wide character strings in order to support
internationalization. <P>
</UL>

The following describes how to configure the Name_Server server and
client test applications. <P>

<UL>
<LI> <B> Startup configuration </B> <P>
Configuring a Name_Server server or client requires specifying all or
some of the following parameters. These parameters can be passed in to
main through command line as follows:<P>

<A NAME="time-overview">
<H3> Overview of Time Service</H3>

Time Service provides accurate, fault-tolerant clock synchronization
for computers collaborating in local area networks and wide area
networks.  Synchronized time services are important in distributed
systems that require multiple hosts to maintain accurate global
time. The architecture of the distributed time service contains the 
following Time Server, Clerk, and Client components: <P>

<UL>
<LI> <I> Time Server </I> answers queries about the time made by
Clerks. <P>

<LI> <I> Clerk </I> queries one or more Time Servers to determine 
the correct time, calculates the approximate correct time using one of
several distributed time algorithms and updates its own local system
time. <P>

<LI> <I> Client </I> uses the global time information maintained by
a Clerk to provide consistency with the notion of time used by clients
on other hosts. <P>
</UL>
<P>
The following are the key classes in the ACE Time Service: <P>

<UL>
<LI> <B><TT> Class TS_Server_Handler </TT></B> <P>

TS_Server_Handler represents the server side of communication between
clerk and server. It interprets incoming requests for time updates,
gets the system time, creates a reply in response to the request and
then sends the reply to the clerk from which it received the request.
For communication it uses the helper class Time_Request.<P>

<LI> <B><TT> Class TS_Server_Acceptor </TT></B> <P>

TS_Server_Acceptor allocates in its handle_input routine a new instance
of class TS_Server_Handler on the heap, and accepts connections into this
TS_Server_Handler.<P>

<LI> <B><TT> Class TS_Clerk_Handler </TT></B> <P>

TS_Clerk_Handler represents the clerk side of communication between
clerk and server. It generates requests for time updates every timeout
period and then sends these requests to all the servers it is
connected to asynchronously. It receives the replies to these requests
from the servers through its handle_input method and then adjusts the
time using the roundtrip estimate. It caches this time, which is
subsequently retrieved by TS_Clerk_Processor.<P>

<LI> <B><TT> Class TS_Clerk_Processor </TT></B> <P>

TS_Clerk_Processor creates a new instance of TS_Clerk_Handler for
every server connection it needs to create. It periodically calls
send_request() of every TS_Clerk_Handler to send a request for time
update to all the servers. In the process, it retrieves the latest
time cached by each TS_Clerk_Handler and then uses it to compute its
notion of the local system time.<P>

<LI> <B> Algorithms </B> <P>

Currently, updating the system time involves taking the average of all
the times received from the servers.<P>
</UL>

The following is a description of how to configure the Time Server
clerk and server services: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B> Startup configuration </B> <P>

Configuring a server requires specifying the port number of the
server. This can be specified as a command line argument as follows: <P>

	-p &lt;port number&gt;

<P>
A clerk communicates with one or more server processes. To communicate
with the server process, a client needs to know the INET_Addr, where
the server offers its service. The configuration parameters namely the
server port and server host are passed as command line arguments when
starting up the clerk service as follows: <P>

    -h &lt;server host1&gt;:&lt;server port1&gt; -h &lt;server host2&gt;:&lt;server port2&gt; ...
<P>
Note that multiple servers can be specified in this manner for the
clerk to connect to when it starts up. The server name and the port
number need to be concatenated and separated by a ":". In addition,
the timeout value can also be specified as a command line argument as
follows:
<P>

	-t timeout

<P>
The timeout value specifies the time interval at which the clerk
should query the servers for time updates.
<P>
By default a Clerk does a non-blocking connect to a server. This can
be overridden and a Clerk can be made to do a blocking connect by
using the -b flag.

<H3><A NAME="token-overview">Token Service</A></H3>

The ACE Token Service provides local and remote mutexes and
readers/writer locks.  For information regarding the deadlock
detection algorithm, check out ACE_Token_Manager.h.  For information
about an implementation of the Composite Pattern for Tokens, check out
Token_Collection.h.  The classes which implement the local and remote
synchronization primitives are listed below:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B><TT>ACE_Local_Mutex</TT></B><P>

       This class is a more general-purpose synchronization mechanism
       than SunOS 5.x mutexes.  For example, it implements "recursive
       mutex" semantics, where a thread that owns the token can
       reacquire it without deadlocking.  In addition, threads that
       are blocked awaiting the token are serviced in strict FIFO
       order as other threads release the token (SunOS 5.x mutexes
       don't strictly enforce an acquisition order).  Lastly,
       ACE_Local_Mutex performs deadlock detection on acquire
       calls.<p>

  <LI> <B><TT>ACE_Remote_Mutex</TT></B><P>

       This is the remote equivalent to ACE_Local_Mutex.  The
       Remote_Mutex class offers methods for acquiring, renewing, and
       releasing a distributed synchronization mutex.  Similar to
       ACE_Local_Mutex, ACE_Remote_Token_Proxy offers recursive
       acquisition, FIFO waiter ordering, and deadlock detection.  It
       depends on the Token Server for its distributed synchronization
       semantics.<p>
       
  <LI> <B><TT>ACE_Local_RLock</TT></B><P>

       This class implements the reader interface to canonical
       readers/writer locks.  Multiple readers can hold the lock
       simultaneously when no writers have the lock.  Alternatively,
       when a writer holds the lock, no other participants (readers or
       writers) may hold the lock.  This class is a more
       general-purpose synchronization mechanism than SunOS 5.x
       RLocks.  For example, it implements "recursive RLock"
       semantics, where a thread that owns the token can reacquire it
       without deadlocking.  In addition, threads that are blocked
       awaiting the token are serviced in strict FIFO order as other
       threads release the token (SunOS 5.x RLockes don't strictly
       enforce an acquisition order).<P>

  <LI> <B><TT>ACE_Local_WLock</TT></B><P>

       This class implements the writer interface to canonical
       readers/writer locks. Multiple readers can hold the lock
       simultaneously when no writers have the lock.  Alternatively,
       when a writer holds the lock, no other participants (readers or
       writers) may hold the lock.  This class is a more
       general-purpose synchronization mechanism than SunOS 5.x WLock.
       For example, it implements "recursive WLock" semantics, where a
       thread that owns the token can reacquire it without
       deadlocking.  In addition, threads that are blocked awaiting
       the token are serviced in strict FIFO order as other threads
       release the token (SunOS 5.x WLocks don't strictly enforce an
       acquisition order).<P>

  <LI> <B><TT>ACE_Remote_RLock</TT></B><P>

       This is the remote equivalent to ACE_Local_RLock. Multiple
       readers can hold the lock simultaneously when no writers have
       the lock.  Alternatively, when a writer holds the lock, no
       other participants (readers or writers) may hold the lock.
       ACE_Remote_RLock depends on the ACE Token Server for its
       distributed synchronization semantics.<P>
       
  <LI> <B><TT>ACE_Remote_RLock</TT></B><P>

       This is the remote equivalent to ACE_Local_WLock.<P>
</UL>

The Token Server provides distributed mutex and readers/writer lock
semantics to the ACE Token library.  ACE_Remote_Mutex,
ACE_Remote_RLock, and ACE_Remote_WLock, are proxies to the Token
Server.  The following are the key classes in the ACE Token
Server:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B><TT>class Token_Acceptor</TT></B><P>

       The Token_Acceptor is a Token_Handler factory.  It accepts
       connections and passes the service responsibilities off to a
       new Token_Handler.<p>

  <LI> <B><TT>class Token_Handler</TT></B><P>

       This class is the main class ``entry point'' of the ACE Token service.  It
       receives token operation requests from remote clients and turns
       them into calls on local tokens (acquire, release, renew, and
       remove).  In OMG CORBA terminology, it is an ``Object Adapter.'' It also
       schedules and handles timeouts that are used to support "timed
       waits."  Clients used timed waits to bound the amount of time
       they block trying to get a token.<P>
</UL>

The following describes how to configure the Token Server:<P>
<UL>
  <LI> <b>Startup configuration</B><P>

       The only parameter that the Token Server takes is a listen port

       svc.conf file.<P>

<A NAME="logging-strategy-overview">
<H3> Overview of Logging Strategy Service</H3>

The Logging Strategy Service can be used to control the output of all the
network services. It can be invoked with certain flags that determine
where the output of all the services should go. The Logging Strategy
Service sets the flags in ACE_Log_Msg, which controls all the streams
through macros such as ACE_DEBUG, ACE_ERROR, and ACE_ERROR_RETURN. If
default behavior is required, the Logging Strategy Service need not be
invoked or it can be invoked with no parameters. <P>

The following describes how to configure the Logging Strategy
Service:<p> 

<UL>
<LI> <b>Startup configuration</B><P>

Here are the command line arguments that can be given to the Logging
Strategy Service: <P>

    -f &lt;flag1&gt;|&lt;flag2&gt;|&lt;flag3&gt;    (etc...) <P>

    where a flag can be any of the following: <P>

<TABLE cellpadding = 10 cellspacing = 0 border = 5>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    <B> Flags </B>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    <B> Description </B>
</TD>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    STDERR <BR>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    Write messages to stderr. <BR>
</TD>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    LOGGER <BR>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    Write messages to the local client logger deamon. <BR>
</TD>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    OSTREAM <BR>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    Write messages to the ostream that gets created by specifying a
    filename (see below) <BR> 
</TD>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    VERBOSE <BR>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    Display messages in a verbose manner  <BR>
</TD>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    SILENT <BR>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN = TOP ALIGN = LEFT>
    Do not print messages at all <BR>
</TD>

</TABLE>
<P>

Note: If more than one flag is specified, the flags need to be 'OR'ed
as above syntax shows. Make sure there is no space in between the flag
and '|'. <P>

    -s filename
 <P>

If the OSTREAM flag is set, this can be used to specify the filename
where the output should be directed. Note that if the OSTREAM flag is
set and no filename is specified, ACE_DEFAULT_LOGFILE will be used to
write the output to. <P>

<LI> <B> Examples: </B> <P>
      Here is an example svc.conf entry that dynamically loads the
      Logging Strategy Service specifying that the output be sent 
      to STDERR: <P>

<LI> To direct output only to STDERR, specify command line arguments as: <P>
	"-f STDERR"
<P>

<LI> To direct output to both STDERR and a file called "mylog", specify
command line arguments as: <P>
	"-f STDERR|OSTREAM -s mylog"
