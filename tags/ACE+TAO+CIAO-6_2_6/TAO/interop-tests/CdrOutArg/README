This test validates that TAO does not add unneeded CDR alignment bytes as pad when the
only arguments to an operation are out args. The interceptors are necessary to add some
service conotext data that would otherwise require padding. Prior to the fix, and Orbix
server would throw a MARSHAL exception even though the extra bytes are counted in the
message length.

To build, use MPC to compile a client in the tao directory, then use Orbix defined tools
to build the server in the orbix directory.

Tu run, issue the following commands, a successful test will have no exceptions and will
terminate the server upon completion.

  orbix/server -o test.ior

  tao/client -k file://test.ior
