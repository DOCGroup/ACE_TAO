Description:

This is another test showing the use of a Custom Servant Dispatching
(CSD) Strategy.  This test uses the reference implementation, known as the
Thread Pool CSD Strategy.  This tests some simple remote two-way CORBA
requests and a simple remote one-way request.

The server application creates 10 servant object, runs the ORB event
loop using the main thread, and uses 10 worker thread for the
Thread Pool CSD Strategy.

The client application invokes simple two-way calls on the object
reference.  There is also a simple one-way call that is also made on
the object reference.

The run_test.pl script will launch 1 sever process, and 40 client processes.
Since the server process contains 10 distinct servants, the clients are
evenly divided such that each servant "serves" 4 distinct clients.


Executables:

  * client_main

      This is the client test executable.

      Command-line arguments:

        -? : Prints the executable's available command-line options, and
             then exits.

        -i <ior string> : Provide the IOR to the client (ie, file://some.ior).

  * server_main

      This is the server test executable.

      Command-line arguments:

        -? : Prints the executable's available command-line options, and
             then exits.

        -p <ior filename prefix> : Common prefix used in all ior filenames
                                   that are output.

        -s <num servants> : The number of servant objects in the server.

        -c <num clients> : The number of clients that will use the server.

  * run_test.pl

      This perl script will run an automated test using 40 client processes
      and 1 server process.  The script returns 0 if the test was successful.

      No command-line options are supported.  Simply execute the perl script
      as follows:

          $ ./run_test.pl
