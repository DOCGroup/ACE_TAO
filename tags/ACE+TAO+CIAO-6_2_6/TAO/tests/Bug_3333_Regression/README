This test checks that any transparent reinvocations in response to
LOCATION_FORWARD responses to GIOP::Requests are still bounded by the
Relative Roundtrip timeout set by the user for the entire request.

The server is configured to run in the test script with -ORBCollocation NO
and -ORBObjRefStyle URL. Both are required for it to work.

It exports two IORs. One is used for control - to shut the server down.
The other will cause a client narrowing it to enter an endless
LOCATION_FORWARD loop.

The client sets a Relative Roundtrip Timeout that should end this loop for
the test to succeed.

Success looks like this:

Test OK - RELATIVE_RT_TIMEOUT ends location forward loop.
(4232|3077606096) server - event loop finished

... anything else is probably a regression.
