This test represents a special case where a middle-tier server is waiting for
a connect to complete and has to deal with an upcall request.

While the MT_NOUPCALL wait strategy was working for reply waits, it was not
being honored during connect waits. This test shows that connect waits will
now also defer incoming requests. To do so, an invalid IP address must be used
for the "upper" server address, since anything routable will either connect or
fail too quickly for the test case to be observed.

Run the test by starting the server:

  ./server -ORBSvcConf mt_noupcall.conf

And the client:

  ./client

Run the server without the -ORBSvcConf argument to observe the failure.
