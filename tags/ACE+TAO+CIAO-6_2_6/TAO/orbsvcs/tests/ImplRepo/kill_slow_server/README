This test verifies the ImplRepo service can tolerate servers that are slow to
start. In some cases a server may have dependencies to resolve after creating
its POAs but before activating them. During this time the server is unable to
respond to shutdown requests, and a kill is required. This test ensures that
following the failed shutdown and subsequent kill, the server can be restarted.

The server instances append their pid to a status file, which the run script
interogates for judging success.

Runtime options are -debug to turn on verbose debugging to separate log files
and -no_dns, which forces the use of 127.0.0.1 in endpoints for running in
environments in which DNS is not properly configured.
