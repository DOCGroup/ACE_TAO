This directory contains a test example for the DEV_SAP
class category. It implements a class TTY_IO that is
derived from ACE_DEV_IO and adds a control method
with specific features for a serial line connection
(e.g. /dev/ttya and /dev/ttyb on UNIX systems).

The reader/reader executable initializes its
device-special file (given as command-line parameter),
reads characters from it (until it recognizes character 'q')
ands sends the characters read to stdout.

The writer/writer executable also initializes its
device-special file (given as command-line parameter),
reads characters from stdin (until'q') and sends them
to the device.

To run the tests I connect /dev/ttya and /dev/ttyb (with a
zero modem cable) and start the reader with "reader /dev/ttya"
and the writer (in a different window) with "writer /dev/ttyb".

Characters typed in the writer window should now appear as output
in the reader window. Note that characters are buffered till EOL.
