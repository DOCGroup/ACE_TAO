This directory contains the following programs:

  ftrt_eventservice : Implements the functionality of fault tolerant event channel.
                    It can be started directly or  be started by the ft_factory.

  ftrtec_factory_service : A program used to spawn the ftrt_eventservice process. The process it
               create can be controled through "test.cfg" whose contents should begin with the
               repository id of EventChannel followed by the executable path of
               ftrt_eventservice.

  ftrtec_gateway_service : An intermediator program between the ftrt_eventservice and the clients which do not support FT CORBA.

  consumer : A shell script to start the consumer test program. The actual consumer pragram is in orbsvcs/tests/FtRtEvent.

  supplier : A shell script to start the supplier test program. The actual supplier pragram is in orbsvcs/tests/FtRtEvent.

  ftec : a shell script to start ftrt_eventservice.

Quick start:

  Run the applications as follows:


  1. Start Naming_Service
   $ $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service -m 1
     or you can use the shell script NameService in this directory to start it.

  2. Start the ftrt_eventservice. Use the "-p" option to start it as a primary and
     use the "-j" option to start it as a backup.

  $ ./ftec -p
  $ ./ftec -j
  $ ./ftec -j


  3. Start the consumer and supplier.
  $ ./consumer
  $ ./supplier

How do we add a new FTRTEC to the system?

  Just use

  ./ftec -j

  The newly created process will contact to the naming service and then join to
  the existing object group.

Is there any adjustable options for FTRTEC?

  Here is the list of options for the ftec script

  -sciop           Use SCIOP for CORBA communication
  -sctp            Use SCTP for fault detection
  -hb n            Specify the heart beat interval in sec
                   for SCTP connection, this option also activate sctp option.
  -ami             Use AMI call for replication messages (The default is
                   two-way CORBA call for replication)
  -p               activate as a primary replica.
  -j               activate as a backup replica.


 Below are some options that are used for the consumer and supplier
    test scripts.

  -sciop          Use SCIOP for CORBA communication. This requires that the Naming
                  Service and ftec are also started using SCIOP transport protocol.

  -d n            Specify the transaction depth. The transaction depth indicates the
                  number of replicas that must complete the subscription request before
                  the request can return.

  -t f.f          For supplier only. Specify the time interval between event sending
                  in seconds, this value should be a float point.

 If you the naming service are not running at the same machine with above programs,
 you can always set the environmental variables NameServiceIOR before starting the
 ftec, consumer or supplier.


 How do I start the FTRTEC using ftrtec_factory_service?

 The ftrtec_factory_service is a small program that can instaniate a ftrt_eventservice on demand.
 It exports the FT::GenericFactory interface to its client. There are two ways that
 you can get the IOR for the factory object. 1) specify the name you want the factory
 register to the naming service and then get the IOR from the naming service by
 the name. 2) output the IOR to a file when the factory starts. Here are the options

    ftrtec_factory_service :

      -i id_string          The id field of the name that is used to register to the naming service
      -k kind_string        The kind field of the name that is used to register to the naming service
      -o output_filename    The output file name for the factory IOR.

Once you get the IOR for the factory, you can use create_object to intantiate the ftrt_eventservice.
Here are the parameters in create_object() to control how ftrt_eventservice is created.

   type_id : this value should be "IDL:FtRtecEventChannelAdmin/EventChannel:1.0"
   the_criteria : the_criteria is a sequence of Property which in term consists of
                  "nam" and "value". Below a a list of possible nam and values.

           nam                                                  value
       ==========================================================================
         FTEC_MEMBERSHIP                                        PRIMARY
                                                                BACKUP
                                                                NONE
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
         FTEC_DETECTOR_TRANSPORT_PROTOCL                        TCP
                                                                SCTP
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         FTEC_HEART_BEAT                                 the heart beat value in sec.
                                       (Note, you have to specify it using string, i.e.
                                               the_criteria[0].value <<= "5");
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         FTEC_REPLICATION_STRATEGY                              AMI

                                        (If not specified, the ftrt_eventservice use default
                                         two-way call for replication)
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        NameServieIOR                                 the corbaloc representation for the
                                                      naming service
        =======================================================================================

     Any nam string started with "-" will be used as a command line option to start ftrt_eventservice.
     For example, if you specfiy the name as "-ORBEndpoint" and value as "sciop://" then the
     ftrt_eventservice can be started using sciop.

How do I use the ftrtec_gateway_service program ?

    The FTRTEC uses some features in FT CORBA that requires every client to use FT ORB to work. If your
    client is written based other ORBs other than TAO. You cannot get the desired fault tolerance feature.
    In this case you can have the ftec_gateway as an intermediator between the FTRTEC and you client program.
    For example, if you have an existing client called my_supplier.

    # setting up the event channel group as previously stated.

    $ftrtec_gateway_service -o gateway.ior        ## start the gateway and output the IOR of the gateway to a file
    $my_supplier -i file://gateway.ior  ## start the supplier using the gateway
