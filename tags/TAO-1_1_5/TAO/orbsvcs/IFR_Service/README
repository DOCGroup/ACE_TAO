TypeCodeFactory

The TypeCodeFactory is built as a DLL and is loaded
into the ORB dynamically. Applications can get the
object reference with
'orb->resolve_initial_references ("TypeCodeFactory");'

The makefile for this library is Makefile.TypeCodeFactory,
and for the build to succeed, the TAO library must be built 
with either the compiler option 'interface_repo=1' or (for 
MSVC users) the line #define TAO_HAS_INTERFACE_REPOSITORY 1 
uncommented in TAO/tao/orbconf.h.


Interface Repository

Requires TAO library built with the same condition as
given above for TypeCodeFactory. Also requires TypeCodeFactory 
(this directory) and TAO_Svc_Utils (found in TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs)
libraries. Executable name is IFR_Service.

Command line options are:

 -p		Makes the Interface Repository persistent.

 -b <filename>	Overrides the default filename used for 
		persistent storage. The default filename
		is "ifr_default_backing_store".

 -r		Uses win32 registry for the database. Not
		available with persistence. If -p is on
		the command line, this option is ignored.
		If the platform is not win32, an error
		message is output.

 -o <filename>	Overrides the default filename used for 
		outputting the Interface Repository IOR. 
		The default filename is "if_repo.ior".

Test code for the Interface Repository can be found in
TAO/orbsvcs/tests/InterfaceRepo.

More information about the Interface Repository can be found in 
TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html.
