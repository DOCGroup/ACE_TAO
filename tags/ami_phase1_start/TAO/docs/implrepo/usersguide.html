<h3>User's Guide</h3>

<p>The Implementation Repository is still kind of in a state of
flux and will probably change quite a bit this semester. Right
now it works, although it is still a bit inflexible. Most of this
document will change, so make sure to get the version of this
document that is paired with the version of the IR that you are
using.</p>

<hr>

<h4>What does the server need to do.</h4>

<p>The IR needs information about the server to be able to direct
to the right place. The current scheme uses a regular persistent
IOR and replaces the host and port with that of the IR. Then when
the call comes into the IR, it sends back a LOCATION_FORWARD to
the client and directs it to the correct server (after starting
it if necessary).</p>

<p>So the server needs to know the IOR of the IR in order to
change the host and port in it to that of the IR. The information
the IR needs to receive from the server is its poa name (which it
uses as an identifier) and commands used to restart the server.</p>

<hr>

<h4>The IR_Helper class</h4>

<p>Most of the work on the server is done in the IR_Helper class.
The first thing it expects is to have the implrepo.ior file in
the current directory. This file contains the IOR of the IR.
IR_Helper then uses this to register itself. </p>

<p>Here is the small checklist I went through when I used the
IR_Helper class in Airplane Test. The Cubit-style references are
just refering to any server that has used the structure of the
IDL_Cubit test (a lot of TAO's examples are like this).</p>

<dir>
    <li>Make yourself an IR_Helper object.&nbsp; (If you follow
        the Cubit-style architecture, this will be a pointer in
        the Server_i class). </li>
    <li>After you create the POA, construct the IR_Helper and
        pass it the relevant information. (Cubit-style: assign a
        new object within Server_i::init) </li>
    <li>If you need to register, call register_server ()
        (Cubit-style: add another option &quot;-r&quot; and have
        it set a flag.&nbsp; Within Server_i::init call
        register_server ()) </li>
    <li>After you create and register your objects, call
        change_object to redo the references. &nbsp; Then you can
        output the new IOR.&nbsp; (Cubit-style: still within
        Server_i::init) </li>
    <li>Right before ORB::run call notify_startup and afterwards,
        call notify shutdown (Cubit-style: within Server_i::run) </li>
</dir>

<h4>To use, or not to use the IR</h4>

<p>If you look at the tests, they use -r and -i flags to
determine how to use the IR. The -i flag turns on the use of the
Implementation Repository (so the server can be tested without
the IR). The -r flag is used to register the entry in the IR for
the server. Note that -r will not work in the example without -i.
This does require some more work on the server side, so if you
choose you can just use the IR all the time and only worry about
-r.</p>

<hr>

<h4>The implrepo.conf file</h4>

<p>Because with the way it is set up, and the current
over-restrictiveness of the POA locks, the IR requires a special
configuration file, implrepo.conf, which you need to pass to the
IR via <font face="Times New Roman"><code>-ORBsvcconf
implrepo.conf</code></font> flag</p>
