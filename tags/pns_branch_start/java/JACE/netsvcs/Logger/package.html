Logging Service for processing logging records received from remote hosts.
<P>
The strategy for how to process the records can be easily changed via the
command line.
<P>
A simple test client is available in the tests directory under netsvcs\Logger.
The service itself can either be run on the command line (by running
ServerLoggingAcceptor) or by loading it with a ServiceConfig file (see
the tests for the service configurator).
