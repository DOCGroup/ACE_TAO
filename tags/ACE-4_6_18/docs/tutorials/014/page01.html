<p><b>ACE_Stream</b> is handy when you have several <b>ACE_Task</b> objects
that you would like to link together.

<p>An intermediate class you we will deal with is the <b>ACE_Module</b>.

<p>The basic plan is to wrap your <b>Task</b> into a <b>Module</b>, push 
the <b>Module</b> onto the <b>Stream</b>.  Do this for each <b>Task</b>,
 and then inject <b>Message_Block</b>s into the <b>Stream</b>.

<p>Each <b>Task</b> then processes the <b>Message_Block</b>, and forwards
it on to the next <b>Task</b> in the <b>Stream</b>.

<p>If you are not already familiar with <b>Message_Block</b>s and <b>Message_Queue</b>s,
I highly suggest that you check out <A HREF="../#MQ">Tutorials 10-13</A>.

<p>Streams can be used for both downstream and upstream movement of messages.  Used 
this way mirrors closely the way System V STREAMS work.  But you don't have to use them
bidirectionally.  In this tutorial, we only use one direction of the Stream.  Down.
