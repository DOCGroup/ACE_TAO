   In client_handler.h I alluded to the fact that we'll mess around with a
   Client_Acceptor pointer.  To do so, we need the Client_Acceptor object

   We know that including client_handler.h is redundant because
   client_acceptor.h includes it.  Still, the sentry prevents double-inclusion
   from causing problems and it's sometimes good to be explicit about what
   we're using.

   On the other hand, we don't directly include any ACE header files here.
