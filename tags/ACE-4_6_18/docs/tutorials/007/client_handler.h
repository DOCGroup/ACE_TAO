/* Our client handler must exist somewhere in the ACE_Event_Handler
   object hierarchy.  This is a requirement of the ACE_Reactor because
   it maintains ACE_Event_Handler pointers for each registered event
   handler.  You could derive our Client_Handler directly from
   ACE_Event_Handler but you still have to have an ACE_SOCK_Stream for
   the actually connection.  With a direct derivative of
   ACE_Event_Handler, you'll have to contain and maintain an
   ACE_SOCK_Stream instance yourself.  With ACE_Svc_Handler (which is
   a derivative of ACE_Event_Handler) some of those details are
   handled for you.  */

    type of callback, the callback mask is provided to inform
    handle_close() exactly which method failed.  That way, you don't
    have to maintain state information between your handle_* method
    calls. The <handle> parameter is explained below...  As a
