Last time around we put an object into a message queue by using the
copy() method to create a duplicate of the object.  That's probably OK 
for simple objects that aren't very large.  However, if you have an
object that contains pointers or tons of data then that approach is
going to cause problems.
<P>
What we'll do in this tutorial is specialize the ACE_Message_Block 
object so that it can carry our data more efficiently.  As you'll see, 
this isn't very difficult at all.
