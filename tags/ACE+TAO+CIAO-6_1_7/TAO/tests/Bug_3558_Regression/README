	Test written for Bugzilla #3558

  This test is based on the Hello TAO test.

  The goal of writing this test is:

- Provide a way to test whether transport cache behaves correctly.
  ORBConnectionCacheMax is programmatically set to 1. When a second
  connection is esthablished, we expect an exception. However, it seems that
  the transport cache adjusts itself (no exception is thrown).

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

or, with debug information:

$ ./run_test.pl -debug

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
