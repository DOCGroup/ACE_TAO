Things to do
------------

"Simple" things

- Remove kerberos warnings

+ Need to fix the following warnings:
    "Video_Server.cpp", line 880: Warning: para hides Video_Server::para.
    "Video_Server.cpp", line 906: Warning: para hides Video_Server::para.

+ Seg fault while exiting
  Destructor of reactor crashes the server
  -- I think I've fixed this! Naga, can you confirm that it doesnt crash
     anymore ?

+ Parent-Child relationship
   -- parent goes back and listens for new connections
   -- child handles this connection

- rttag is enabled with -r
  does it work ?

+ rename Mpeg_Server to AV_Server

- Make #define's into enums in common.h/globals.h

+ Change handle_input to handle_connection in
  Mpeg_Svc_Handler

+ Video_Sig_Handler is in Mpeg_Server -- needs to be moved to Video_Server
  -- done

+ Split up VIDEO_FAST into two commands - VIDEO_FAST_{FORWARD,BACKWARD}

+ create a helper class for video, and put FBread et al in that

- try compiling ACE and the application with fast=1 to see if
  performance improves

- Rename "play", "play_send" etc. appropriately



"Not-so-simple" things 


- Logic for Video_Server is convoluted!!

- Need to modularize Audio_Server

- Seperate command parsing in its own class
