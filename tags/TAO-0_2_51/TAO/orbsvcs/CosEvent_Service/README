The CosEvent_Service is a COS compilant Event Service.

The service is registered with the naming service with the name "CosEventService"
It exposes the <EventChannel> interface which can be used by suppliers and consumers to
connect and send events.
  As of now, the channel supports the <ACE_ES_EVENT_ANY> type events.

To run the Event Channel:
1. you must have a running Naming Service.
   if not, start one at $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service

2. you must have a running Real Time Event Channel.
   if not, start one at $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service

3. execute the CosEvent_Service. It takes the following parameters :

      -n <COS Event Service name>
        specifies the name with which to register the Event Service.

      -r <Real Time Event Service name>
        specifies the name with which to *look* for the RtEC.

If a Rtec is not running, then the CosEvent_Service starts its own Rtec.
