<P>From here, we to move on to the main program loop. In a way, we're
starting at the final product when we do this, but it is a very simple
piece of code and a good place to start.

<P>The <A HREF="server.cpp">main</A>
program is really quite simple. The real work is done in the ACE derived
classes.

<P>
Kirthika Parameswaran offers this abstract of Tutorial 1:
<UL>
<P>
This is a simple logging server example.
The Reactor is used to handle more than one client request using a
single thread of execution instead of one thread per client. The Reactor
reactes to events and demultiplexes the events to the appropriate
Event_Handler registered with it, using the "callback" technique. The
reactor runs in an infinte event loop handling all the incoming events.
<P>
The Logging_Acceptor listens at a SERVER PORT address and passively
waits for requests to arrive. The Acceptor is also an Event_Handler and
is registered with the Reactor. This way it is simply yet another
Event_Handler for the Reactor and hence no special processing is needed
for it.
<P>
Once a connection request occurs, the Acceptor accepts it and
a connection is established. The reactor instance is passed to the
handler so that it can register with the Reactor. It does so with an
ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK.
<P>
The Logging_Client is another Event_Handler which actually handles the
client requests in its handle_input() method. It is also registered
with the Reactor with the ACE_Event_Handler::READ_MASK.
<P>
The Event_Handlers can be unregistered from the Reactor using
handle_close() methods 
or explicitly calling the remove_handler() methods. 
<P>
This server application builds and executes succesfully waiting for
client requests to arrive.
<P>
</UL>
FYI (from Doug):
<UL>
The ACCEPT_MASK is defined in the ACE_Event_Handler class.  It's used
to inform the Reactor that you want to register an event handler to
"accept" a connection passively.  Not surprisingly, the ACE_Acceptor
component uses this.
<P>
The READ_MASK is also defined in the ACE_Event_Handler class.  It's
used to inform the Reactor that you want to register an event handler
to "read" data from an established connection.

<P>As I said, the main program is really quite simple:
<UL>
<LI>
Create an address for the <I>port</I> we want to listen to</LI>

<LI>
Create an acceptor which listens on that address</LI>

<LI>
Register the acceptor with a reactor to respond to the connection requests</LI>

<LI>
Enter an infinite loop to let the reactor handle the events</LI>
</UL>
On the next page, we will take a look at the acceptor and how it responds
to new connection requests.
