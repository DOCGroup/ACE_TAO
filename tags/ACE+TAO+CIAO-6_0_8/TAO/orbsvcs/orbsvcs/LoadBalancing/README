This directory contains the implementations of the TAO Load Balancing
service, which is called as Cygnus.

Cygnus currently implements the latest revision of the OMG Load Balancing
and Monitoring proposed specification. The features and advantages of
Cygnus include:
1. Multiple object group support.
2. Extensible load balancing strategies through IDL interface.
3. Extensible load monitoring.
4. Support for push and pull style monitoring.
5. Support for infrastructure and application controlled memberships.
6. Efficient server side transparency.
7. Default implementations of well known load balancing strategies.

Future Work targeted:
1. Implement a distributed load balancing service.
2. Implement stateful load balancing service.
3. Implement self adaptive load balancing strategies using control
theoretical techniques.
