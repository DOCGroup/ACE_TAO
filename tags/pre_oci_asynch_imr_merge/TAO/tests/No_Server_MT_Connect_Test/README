@page No_Server_MT_Connect_Test  README File

The objective of the test is to track the behavior of the
multi-threaded client when no server is present to connect. The client
uses all the connect strategies provided by the ORB. All the client
threads should exit gracefully.

This test is to make sure (hopefully) the refcount mechanism on the
handler used that safeguards handlers getting deleted when the
connection establishment fails.

Please refrain from "improving", extending or expanding this
test, if you need to change

To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
