<P>Current status: (As of January 7th, 1998.)
<UL>
<LI>
Support for the "native" keyword added.</LI>

<LI>
Introduced tests for object references to TAO. Still incomplete.</LI>

<LI>
Param_Test example is able to test string sequences, fixed structs, variable
sized structs and nested structs</LI>

<LI>
Param_Test test suite can now test fixed structs and string sequences.This
needed bug fixes to TAO ORB core.</LI>

<LI>
A new test to test all the parameter passing modes for a number of data
types has been added. At this point in time, it tests primitive types and
strings. Other tests will be added. Bugs discovered thru these tests have
been fixed.</LI>

<LI>
Very preliminary support for arrays. Not working yet.</LI>

<LI>
Many bugs associated with stub generation fixed. This included support
for return values that are variable sized IDL types. Unions improved.</LI>

<LI>
Support for sequences of strings and object references added. However,
it is not tested yet so there may be some bugs. We should have these fixed
in a day or so.</LI>

<LI>
Support for handling exceptions added. TAO does not use direct C++ exceptions.
Instead it uses the CORBA::Environment based approach.</LI>

<LI>
Sequences as out parameters have been tested in the IDL_Cubit example.
A test suite is currently being built to test all the parameter passing
modes on a variety of IDL data types.</LI>

<LI>
Support for attributes completed. Not tested yet.</LI>

<LI>
The problem of incorrect code generation for typedefs defined in an imported
file is resolved.</LI>

<LI>
Problems when interfaces use single or multiple inheritance solved. The
problem was with the demultiplexing code, the generated operation tables,
and the dispatching mechanism. We are currently testing this with the Event
Channel code.</LI>

<LI>
The problems arising due to public virtual inheritance when casting from
an interface class to CORBA::Object_ptr has been solved. We do this casting
inside the stubs/skeletons rather than first converting an interface class
pointer to a void*, storing it in an Any, and casting it to CORBA::Object_ptr
in the encode/decode methods. The casting inside the stubs/skeletons work
because the compiler has knowledge of both types.</LI>

<LI>
The compiler generates correct code for COSS Naming service and it runs
properly. Correct code also gets generated for the Event Channel program</LI>

<LI>
Include files are handled properly. So are the definitions used inside
the include files that are used in the currently parsed files.</LI>

<LI>
IN, INOUT, and OUT object reference parameters are now supported properly.
We think the same approach should work for sequences, structs, and unions.</LI>

<LI>
Many IDL constructs supported including primitive types, typedefs, sequences,
structures, and unions.</LI>

<LI>
Generates C++ stubs and skeletons that use TAO's <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/HICSS-97.ps.gz">interpretive
IIOP protocol engine</A>.</LI>

<LI>
Generated code closely follows the C++ Mapping specified in the POA Specification
(ORBOS/97-05-15).</LI>

<LI>
Support dynamic libraries on NT, i.e., marking classes for DLL export was
added. Two backend options control the name of the export macro, and the
name of an extra include file were the macro is defined; the options are
<TT>-Wp,export_macro=MACRO_NAME</TT> <TT>-Wp,export_include=INCLUDE_NAME</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
Known bugs/unimplemented constructs:
<UL>
<LI>
Generation of Managed types must somehow be moved to the ORB Core</LI>

<LI>
We need support for ``TIEs'' (i.e., the object form of the Adapter pattern).</LI>

<LI>
TypeCode generation for multidimensional arrays and indirected typecodes
is still a problem.</LI>

<LI>
Unions with default cases yet to be handled</LI>

<LI>
The &lt;&lt;= and >>= operators for user-defined types are not generated
yet.</LI>

<LI>
Deal with names in the IDL definition that are C++ keywords.</LI>

<LI>
IDL is case-insensitive. However, it looks like our front-end is case-sensitive.
Thanks to Anil Gopinath (anil@ittc.ukans.edu) for pointing this out.</LI>

<LI>
tao_idl generates code for a *.idl file only inside the directory where
the *.idl resides. However, it may be required to generate code elsewhere
i.e., in the directory where the compiler was invoked. Thanks to Tom Richards
(tomr@MCMEnterprise.com) for this suggestion.</LI>
</UL>
Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Need to relocate the various libraries used by the IDL compiler out of
the ACE directory. Having them here can cause problems when working with
multiple versions of TAO and a single version of ACE.</LI>

<LI>
Improve IDL compiler to generate compiled form of stubs/skeletons.</LI>

<LI>
Fix bugs in the SunSoft IDL front-end we've uncovered. These primarily
include support for Unions.</LI>

<LI>
Add command line options to TAO IDL. These options will decide what strategy
to use for operation name demultiplexing. Another option may decide whether
to use the interpretive IIOP engine or generate compiled stubs/skeletons.</LI>

<LI>
Use <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/flick/">Flick</A> (from
the University of Utah) to generate compiled stubs.</LI>


<P>Goal is to measure the code size of the interpretive stubs generated
by TAO IDL compiler <I>vs</I> code size of compiled stubs. Then compare
the performance of each. We want to prove the thesis that TAO IDL compiler
generated interpretive stubs have a small code size, yet are comparable
in performance (or slightly less) than compiled stubs. Hence, it will be
useful for small distributed equipment such as handsets, PDAs, etc.

<P>In doing the above, improvements to the IIOP protocol engine in terms
of size/performance/determinism will be made.
<LI>
Tweak the IDL compiler to generate code that's more easily integrated back
into the ORB Core, e.g., POA, etc. This will depend largely on our ability
to generalize the changes necessary to generated code.</LI>

<A NAME="apps"></A>Test &amp; Example Applications</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:naga@cs.wustl.edu">Nagarajan Surendran</A>

<P>Current Status:

<P>The TAO IDL_Cubit test application makes use of the Naming Service
and the server holds a TAO_Naming_Server component.Just running server
and client is enough to test the application.

<P>The various tests in the tests/POA test the different features of
the Portable Object Adapter interface like Explicit Activation, On
Demand Activation,etc..

<P>Future work:

<P>Developing a one-buttoned test for all the different TAO tests
similar to the ACE-one buttoned test.

<P>MT_Cubit:

<P>Current status:

<P>The TAO MT_Cubit test application is meant to serve as a starting point for real-time
tests on the TAO system. It comprises the following parts:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Server.</I> The server creates multiple CORBA objects (servants), each
with different real-time priorities. This priority is implemented by using
real-time thread support provided by the operating system. Thus, requests
sent to a high-priority servant are handled by a high-priority real-time
thread, and those sent to a lower priority servant are handled by correspondingly
lower priority threads.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Client.</I> The client component binds to the servants, and sends a
stream of CORBA requests to the servants. It measures the response time,
i.e. the time taken for the request to complete successfully. In particular,
it measures the time taken for requests sent to the high priority servant
to complete. The volume of lower priority requests is configurable. The
client is thus able to measure the performance of the high-priority servant
in the presence of competition from several lower-priority servants.</LI>
</UL>
Clearly, if the ORB endsystem handles the priorities of the various requests
correctly, increasing the volume of lower priority requests should not
affect the performance seen by the higher priority requests. The application
thus serves as a tool to measure and confirm this behavior.

<P>Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Study the impacts of scheduling &amp; concurrency strategies on performance.</LI>

<LI>
Evolve into a testbed for discovering sources of performance non-determinism
&amp; priority inversion.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="poa"></A>Portable Object Adapter</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:irfan@cs.wustl.edu">Irfan Pyarali</A>

<P>Current Status:
<UL>
<LI>
The POA mostly complete. There are remaining pieces to be implemented,
but much of the POA framework exists. This section will carry updates as
available.</LI>
</UL>
Known issues:
<DL>
<DT>
<I>Support for collocation is not complete.</I></DT>

<DD>
If an object which should be collocated is created via <TT>string_to_object</TT>,
it is created as a remote object rather than collocated.</DD>

<DT>
<I>The stubs and skeletons are not needed.</I></DT>

<DD>
The library includes stubs and skeletons for the Portable Server interfaces,
since all this interfaces have locality constraints the stubs and skeletons
are effectively dead code and should be removed.</DD>
</DL>
Critical work:
<UL>
<LI>
None.</LI>
</UL>
Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Determine the degree to which we will support the full semantics of remote
objects on a collocated object. The spec mandates that collocated object
should behave <I>exactly</I> like remote objects, but that means that request
will have to be queued rather than calling a method directly, and this
could be hazardous to our quest for real-time ORB status.</LI>

<LI>
Provide extensions of the specification to ensure real-time delivery of
messages.</LI>

Points of contact: <A HREF="mailto:cleeland@cs.wustl.edu">Chris Cleeland</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:irfan@cs.wustl.edu">Irfan Pyrarli</A>

<P>Recently Completed Work:
<UL>
<LI>
Added special declaration to OS.h for <TT>inet_ntoa</TT> and other functions
because VxWorks doesn't provide full argument prototypes for these library
functions.</LI>

<LI>
The current caching connector behaves properly in the face of a non-blocking
connect request. The "fix" is simply to not support non-blocking connects
through the cache. When the <TT>connect()</TT> fails with <TT>EWOULDBLOCK</TT>,
morph the error to -1 and clean up the request.</LI>

<LI>
Service handlers obtained from the caching connector are now cleaned up.
The application needs to be able to signal that it's not using it any longer,
and, when the application encounters an error, needs to effectively close
down that connection for good so that a new connection can be initiated.</LI>

<BR>Added the ability for a Svc_Handler to recycle itself. idle() can be
called when the Svc_Handler is done serving a particular connection and
can how be recycled. The Svc_Handler now also has a pointer to a recycler
that is responsible for managing the connections. The recycler is usually
a Cached_Connector.
<BR>Added new class ACE_Recycling_Strategy. It defines the interface (and
default implementation) for specifying a recycling strategy for a Svc_Handler.
This strategy acts as a consular to the Svc_Handler, preparing it for the
tough times ahead when the Svc_Handler will be recycled.
<BR>Added new class ACE_NOOP_Concurrency_Strategy. It implements a no-op
activation strategy in order to avoid calling open on a recycled svc_handler
multiple times.
<BR>ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy now implements the ACE_Connection_Recycling_Strategy
interface. This allows Svc_Handlers to cache themselves with ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy
when they become idle. It also allows them to purge themselves from the
connection cache when the Svc_Handlers close down.
<BR>Also added ~ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy that will cleanup up the connection
cache.</UL>

<A NAME="#VC"></A>How to add IDL files into your Visual C++ projects</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:nw1@cs.wustl.edu">Nanbor Wang</A>.

<P>Each IDL file generates .h, .i and .cpp files. Here is an example of
adding an IDL file named foobar.idl into a VC project.
<OL>
<LI>
Create/open the workspace. Create server project and client project if
you haven't had them ready. Add the IDL file &lt;foobar.idl> and other
non-IDL generated files into both client and server projects.</LI>

<LI>
Added foobarC.h, foobarC.i, foobarC.cpp, foobarS.h, foobarS.i, and foobarS.cpp
into the server project and foobarC.h, foobarC.i, and foobarC.cpp into
the client project.</LI>

<LI>
Now open the project setting window (Project -> Setting... or just press
Alt-F7.) Select the IDL files in both client and server projects. Choose
to set the setting for "All Configuration." Make sure the "Exclude from
build" under the "General" tab is unchecked.</LI>

<LI>
Click on the "Custom Build" tab. Add this entry as the build command for
IDL files:</LI>

<PRE>..\..\..\TAO_IDL\tao_idl $(InputName).idl</PRE>
Notice that your absolute path to TAO_IDL may vary.
<LI>
Now add the following entries as "Output file(s)."</LI>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(InputName)S.h
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(InputName)S.i
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(InputName)S.cpp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(InputName)C.h
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(InputName)C.i
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(InputName)C.cpp</PRE>
Add only one entry in each line.
<LI>
We are all set. Click OK.</LI>

<LI>
Add foobarC.cpp to client project and foobarC.cpp and foobarS.cpp to server
project.</LI>
</OL>
Notice that these procedures only setup the IDL compiler to perform correctly.

<P>&nbsp;p.s. If anyone knows how to set a default setting in VC so we
don't need to perform these procedures every time a new project gets set
up, please let us know. Thanks.&nbsp;
