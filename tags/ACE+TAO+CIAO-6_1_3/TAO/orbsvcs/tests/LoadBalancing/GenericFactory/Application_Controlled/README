This program tests the application controlled membership support
of the Cygnus load balancer. The aim is to allow the application
to create the replicas and then forcefully add them as the members
of the object group maintained by the Cygnus load balancer. When
the clients make a request on the IOR exported by the load
balancer, the load balancer makes use of the round robin algorithm
to make a call on any of the object group members registered with
the load balancer.

Please see $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Loadbalancing for the implementations
of the Cygnus load balancer.
