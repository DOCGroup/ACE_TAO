Test for passing wchar data between TAO and JacORB processes.
This test may also be run for tao-tao on different platforms.

To build this test for JacORB requires a JacORB 2.0 installation, and the
ant build tool. The Java classpath must include $JACORB_HOME/lib/jacorb.jar
and $TAO_ROOT/interop-tests/classes.

To build the tao test client and server, first run mwc.pl in the ordinary
way to generate makefiles or project files. Then to build the JacORB client
and server, use "ant" which assumes $JACORB_HOME is set to the JacORB home
directory.

The TAO server command line is:
  ./server [-o iorfile] [-v]
The default ior file for the server is "./IOR"
The -v option causes the server to output some details of its operation.

The TAO client command line is:
  ./client [-k ior] [[-t 0 < n <= 14]...] [-v] [-x]
The default ior is "file://IOR". Note that it is an IOR, not a filename.
The -t option selects individual tests, no selection implies all tests,
  the -t option may be repeated to select a number of tests
The -v option make the test more verbose, not adding it only outputs final
  pass/fail message.
The -x option makes the client send a shutdown request to the server.
Anything else, such as -?, will yield a list of options and test descriptions.

To run the JacORB client or server, use the "jaco" utility,

jaco -classpath ../classes interop.wchar.Server [-o iorfile] [-v]
jaco -classpath ../classes interop.wchar.Client [-i iorfile] [-t 0..14] [-v] [-x]
Note that Client takes -i iorfile, not -k ior.
