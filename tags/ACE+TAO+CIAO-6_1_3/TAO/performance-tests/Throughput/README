@page Throughput Performance Test README File

	This test tries to estimate the maximum throughput (in bytes
per second) that the ORB can achieve.  The test sends octet sequences
of increasing sizes to a remote consumer, and measures both the time
it takes to receive the data as well as the time required to send it.
A single twoway operation is used to ensure that the data is properly
flushed.

	Please do not extend this test to deal with other data types,
configurations, etc.  If you need to just create a new test.  In the
past we had multi-purpose tests like that, they were hard to maintain,
and the results were hard to interpret.  Furthermore, the test is
purposely simple so its output can be parsed via nightly scripts and
plotted in a graph.   More importantly, the throughput for raw data
and the marshaling time are completely different things and should be
measured with different tools.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful, and prints
out the performance numbers.
