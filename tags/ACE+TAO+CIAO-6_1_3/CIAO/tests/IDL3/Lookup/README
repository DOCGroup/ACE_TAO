Lookup Test
=======================

This test is for IDL compiler handling of references using local
names to declarations in base interfaces, components, valuetypes
and homes, and in supported interfaces. This type of reference
is legal IDL.

The primary point of the test is that the IDL compiler outputs
no errors in processing the IDL file, and the secondary point
is that the generated code compiles successfully. Therefore,
we have no need for export files, export macros, or *_BUILD_DLL
flags.

Thanks to Boris Kolpackov <boris@dre.vanderbilt.edu> for the
original example IDL file, which has been slightly modified
for use in this test.
