ace (6.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of ace 6.0.1-2, SSLv2 support was removed from Debian ACE+TAO
  packages. This follows change introduced in openssl 1.0.0c-2.

  WARNING: it means existing ACE-based software will default to SSL v3
  instead of SSL v2 without warning. Recompiling software explicitly
  using SSL v2 will fail since the ACE_SSL_Context::SSLv2_* enums got
  removed.
