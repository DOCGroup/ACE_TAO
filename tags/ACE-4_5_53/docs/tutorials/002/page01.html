Creating a Better Server </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>In this tutorial, we will build a little on what we learned in the first
tutorial and add a few extras. In the end, we will have a better server
object that is actually simpler and more maintainable than the one we created
before.</P>

<P>To begin, let's ask ourselves the same thing we did at the beginning
of tutorial 001:</P>

<UL>
<P>What do you need to create a server?</P>
</UL>

<OL>
<OL>
<LI>Something which accepts connections from clients</LI>

<LI>Something which handles established connections</LI>

<LI>A main program loop that handles it all</LI>
</OL>
</OL>

<P>Previously, we created a solution which addressed each one of these
questions specifically. At the end of it all, we realized that our only
application-specific coding was confined to the <I>handler</I> portion
of the program. We hinted that there may be a way to eliminate hand-coding
an <I>acceptor</I> each time we want to create a server. Here, we will
explore that approach.</P>
