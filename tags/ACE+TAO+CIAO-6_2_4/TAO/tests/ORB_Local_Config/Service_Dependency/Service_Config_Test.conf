# Dynamically loading each of the Service Objects below causes a
# number of threads to be spawned, each one invoking the Service
# Configurator (e.g. ACE_Service_Config::process_directive().  If the
# Service Configurator is thread safe and reentrant, then parsing of
# this `Service_Config_Test.conf' file should run to completion
# without error.
#
# Test_Object_1 will cause Test_Object_2 and Test_Object_3 to be
# dynamically loaded.  Dynamic loading of each of object will occur in
# a separate thread.
dynamic Test_Object_1 Service_Object * Service_Config_Dependent_DLL:_make_Service_Config_DLL() "2 3"

# Test_Object_4 will cause Test_Object_5 and Test_Object_6 to be
# dynamically loaded.  Dynamic loading of each of object will occur in
# a separate thread.
