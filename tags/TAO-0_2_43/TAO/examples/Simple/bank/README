This is a simple CORBA example that has a module Bank with two
interfaces Account and AccountManager.

The Account interface has operations for balance, deposit and withdraw. It has a readonly attribute for the Account Holder's name. It also has a user defined exception which is raised for withdrawing more moneythen the current balance.

The AccountManager interface has methods to create and close Accounts.
It also has a method to shutdown the server.

run_test.pl : This is a perl script to run the server and client as :
------------
	      server
	      client  -x -b 100 -y Vishal -z Kachroo

	      There are other command line options available for the server and client which are explained as below.

server:
-------

server [-d] [-o IOR_file_name]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag (It is additive more -d flags will give debugging).

When the server is started, you should see as the first line of output
something that looks like
	iiop:1.0//danzon.cs.wustl.edu:10015/P35ad159600081a38/child_poa/server
	(-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
	(-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  This option is additive, i.e.,
the more -d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the
moment, only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d
options are ignored.

-o    This option creates an ior file for the server with the name ior_filename.

The file can be used by clients who wish to access the server directly using this ior file. This
obviates the need for the client to use the naming service for getting the server ior. The client can
use the -f option to specify the file which contains the ior of the server (the same file that was
written by the server using the -o option).


client:
-------

client [-d] [-x] [-n iterations] [-b initial_balance] [-o Name_of_account_holder]
       [-f IOR_file_name ] [-k IOR]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag

-x    Tells the server to shutdown at the end of the test.

-n    no. of iterations

-b    initial balance

-o    Name of the Account Holder

-k    Read IOR from the command line. If this option is specified the client does not use
      the Naming Service for locating the server. It just uses the ior file supplied with
      this option.

-f    Read IOR from the specified file. If this option is specified the client does not use
      the Naming Service for locating the server. It just uses the ior file supplied with
      this option.

The client executes the following tests :

1. Creating accounts with the same name to make sure the Account is
   created only once and he gets back the same object reference each
   time. This is confirmed by the server printing the message for
   Creation of an account only once.

2. Creating accounts with different name to make sure a different
   Account is created and a different IOR returned each time.

3. Creating an Account with some initial balance and then withdrawing
   more than the current balance. The server throws an exception which is
   passed to the client and the client displays the reason for the
   exception.
