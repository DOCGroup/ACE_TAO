Let's look now at the changes to our ACE_Message_Block derivative and
the new ACE_Data_Block derivative.
<P>
The important thing to remember is that the data block (not the
message block) is reference counted.  When you instantiate a new
ACE_Message_Block, it will create one or more ACE_Data_Block objects
to contain the data you need.  Optionally, you can provide it with a
pointer to a data block.
<P>
When you finish with a message block, you should use the release()
method to make it go away.  Do not ever <em>delete</em> an instance of
a message block!  When you invoke release(), the message block will
invoke release() on the data block(s) it contains.  If the block's
reference count goes to zero as a result then the block will <em>delete</em>
itself.
<P>
To increment the reference count of a data block, use the
duplicate() method of the message block (or blocks) to get a new
message block referencing the same data block.  This is very efficient 
since the actual data is not copied.

   In this Tutorial, we derive from ACE_Data_Block for our special data.  With
   the possiblilty that our Task object may forward the unit of work on to
   another thread pool, we have to make sure that the data object doesn't go
   out of scope unexpectedly.  An ACE_Message_Block will be deleted as soon as
   it's release() method is called but the ACE_Data_Blocks it uses are
   reference counted and only delete when the last reference release()es the
   block.  We use that trait to simplify our object memory management.

One of the most difficult parts of this to get right was the Lock
object.  I didn't even have it in the beginning but I soon realized
that the reference counts were getting weird.  A little careful
reading of the comments and the source informed me that some sort of
locking is necessary to keep the counter sane.  The simplest thing at
that point was to use the ACE_Lock_Adaptor&lt;&gt; to adapt ACE_Mutex
appropriately.  The next trick was to ensure that the lock object was
destroyed at the proper time to prevent both memory leaks and core
dumps.  The finaly product may be a little bit intimidating at first
but it's really quite simple once you understand the motivation.
