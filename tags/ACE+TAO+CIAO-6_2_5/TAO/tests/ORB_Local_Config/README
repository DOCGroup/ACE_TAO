  A collection of miscellaneous tests for
  * (testCompatibility) Compatibility of the new interfaces with the old;
  * (testCommandLineDirectives) Processing of the command-line directives;
  * (testOpenDynamicServices) Loading dynamic services in a local repository;
  * (testORBInitializer_Registry) Loading the ORBInitializer_Registry locally;
  * (testTSSGestalt) Test the helper components used to implement the
    temporary substitution of the repository currently used as "global" for the
    sake of registering static services, which are dependent on a dynamic
    service;

  * Tests the working of the ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency class;

test-new-cfg

  *

test-orb-service

  * Loading a dynamic service, which initializes its own ORB;
