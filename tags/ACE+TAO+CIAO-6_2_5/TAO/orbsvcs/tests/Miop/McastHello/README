This test verifies basic functionality of the MIOP support in TAO.
It creates two servers that listen on the same group id for requests.
A client then sends a few requests using MIOP.  If both servers
receive the multicast requests as expected, the test is successful.
The most likely failure of the test is if the servers don't receive
the requests and subsequently time out.

	To run the test, use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.

The test has some unique features that should be noted by
users. Firstly, server.cpp includes MIOP.h, which has some magic for
loading MIOP protocol in static builds. Secondly, the svc.conf has
a directive for loading the right protocol factory. Both of them are
required for static builds in addition to linking with the
TAO_PortableGroup library.

However for dynamic builds things are different

. One need not include MIOP.h. Including MIOP.h will require linking
  in the TAO_PortableGroup library

. The entries in the svc.conf should have dynamic directives. In
  svc.conf you would be required to remove commented parts and run
  the test.
