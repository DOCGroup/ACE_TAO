Admin_Client is a class containing several functions which test
the methods in various IFR object classes. Since automatic
administration of the TAO Interface Repository has not yet been
implemented, each of these functions creates, queries, modifies,
moves, and finally destroys several IFR objects, none of which
are related to anything found in an actual IDL file.

Not every type of IFR object is represented by an Admin_Client
function (the name of which gives a hint about what type of
IFR object it tests). There are two reasons for this - the
first being that there will almost certainly be more tests
added later, and the second being that many of the functions
test more than one IFR object type. For example, interface_test()
tests not only the functionality of InterfaceDef, but also that
of AttributeDef and OperationDef, since these IFR objects are
created only by an InterfaceDef. In a similar way, alias_test()
tests WstringDef and SequenceDef in addition to AliasDef, and
StringDef and PrimitiveDef members are created and tested in
struct_test(), union_test() and exception_test().

To build this test, the TAO library, the TypeCodeFactory
library, the Interface Repository (the last two found in
TAO/orbsvcs/IFR_Service), and these test files must all be built.
In addition, the Interface Repository requires the TAO_Svc_Utils
library in TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.

To run this test, either use the Perl script run_test.pl, or



(Windows)
start the Interface Repository by typing

 ..\..\..\IFR_Service\IFR_Service

in one window, then (in another window)

 IFR_Test -ORBInitRef InterfaceRepository=file://if_repo.ior

(Unix)
in this directory, type

 ../../../IFR_Service/IFR_Service &

then

 ./IFR_Test -ORBInitRef InterfaceRepository=file://if_repo.ior



You may use IP multicast discovery by starting the server with "-m 1"
and use the default multicast address for the InterfaceRepository.

 ../../../IFR_Service/IFR_Service -m 1

and

 ./IFR_Test

You may add any of the options below to the IFR_Test command line. Both the
Perl script and the test executable have the same command line options.
They are:

	-d	Outputs the results of queries along with a string
		explaining the sequence of calls and/or accesses
		leading to each result. There is also informative
		output when an IFR object is modified or moved.
		Default output is the test name only.

	-t	(followed by test name - see below). This will
		execute only the selected test. Default is to
		execute all test functions.
		Test names:
			array
			enum
			alias
			native
			struct
			union
			exception
			constant
			interface
			move
			module


	-i	(followed by number of iterations). This will
		cause each test function (or the selected one)
		to be executed <n> times. A useful selection
		here is -i 2. At the end of each test function,
		all IFR objects created in that function are
		destroyed. If the destroy() function does not
		work properly, then the second execution will
		raise a BAD_PARAM exception when the test
		attempts to create the undestroyed object.

ACE_ASSERT is used to check each result, so an incorrect result
will cause test execution to halt immediately. If a test function
is halted for this or any other reason, it is likely that the
destroy() call(s) at the end of the function were not exectuted.
Before running the test again, the Interface Repository process
should be stopped and restarted to avoid a BAD_PARAM exception.

The IFR server is started in this test with locking enabled. Even
though the test itself is single-threaded, using this option will
ensure that future modifications to IFR code don't cause deadlocks.
