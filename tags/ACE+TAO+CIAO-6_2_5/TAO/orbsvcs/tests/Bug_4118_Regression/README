This test demonstrates the fix for Bugzilla 4118. This test depends on
existing services and utilities, therefore the is no need for a makefile.

The test starts the naming service with persistence, multiple threads,
and no collocation. This makes the single instance behave as a member of
a federation, forcing nested resolves to be handled as though they are
external requests.

The test uses ns_add to compose a naming context cycle by creating a new
context supplying the root context's IOR. Then it tries to bind to a
nested name that traverses the recursion. This second ns_add should run
to completion if all is well. It will hang if the fix for 4118 is not
working.
