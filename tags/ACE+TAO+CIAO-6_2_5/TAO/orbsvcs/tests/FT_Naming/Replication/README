This application tests the replication features of TAO's FT Naming Service.

To run all tests automatically -
	execute Perl script run_test.pl

To run tests manually -
	start the Naming Service (see
	TAO/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/README for valid options),
	then run ./client the optional options are shown below.

NOTE: if running tests manually, the NameService directory must exist
before starting the Naming Service and this directory must be cleaned out
manually after stopping the Naming Service.

The following options exist:
---------------------------
-b	Breath of Context tree, default is 4, minimum is 2

-d	Depth of Context tree, default is 4, minimum is 2

-o	Breath of Object tree, default is 4, minimum is 2

-p      ior for Naming Server 1

-q      ior for Naming Server 2

The client creates two context trees, one of breath b and one of depth d,
and another node with o objects.  It then removes the contexts b-1, d and
the object o-1.  All these are done using the first name server.  The
client then accesses contexts b, b-1, d, d-1, and objects o, o-1 looking
for the appropriate found/not-found returns using the second name server.

        Example (on a Unix system):
        $ $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service -o nsior1\
          -r NameService -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:10001 &
        $ $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service -o nsior2\
          -r NameService -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:10002 &
        $ ./client -p file://nsior1 -q file://nsior2

        where the steps correspond to 1&2)starting the Naming Service
        in redundant mode, 3) running the client.
        Don't forget to kill the name servers after you are done.



EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR THIS TEST
*****************************

Redundancy test OK.
