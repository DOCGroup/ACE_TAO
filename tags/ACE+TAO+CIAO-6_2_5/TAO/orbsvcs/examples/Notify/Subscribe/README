Subscribe example:
----------------
Note: This example is under construction.

The Notification service must be up and running before launching this example.
(See the README under $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Notify_Service for more details.)

Description:
------------
This example sets subscription event type constraints (domain_name,type_name):

At the consumer admin. C1 = ("domain_A", "Type_1").
This means that all consumers connected to this admin object are interested
in receiving events of "domain_A" and "Type_1".

At consumer 1, C2 = ("domain_B", Type_2")
At consumer 2, C3 = ("domain_C", Type_3")

A supplier then send events of all 3 types to the event channel.
i,e. event E1 with event type C1,
     event E2 with event type C2 and
     event E3 with event type C3.

From the subscriptions, consumer1 receives E1 and E2, (not E3) and
consumer2 receives E1 and E3 (not E2).

running the ./Subscribe example will output the events received by each
consumer.
