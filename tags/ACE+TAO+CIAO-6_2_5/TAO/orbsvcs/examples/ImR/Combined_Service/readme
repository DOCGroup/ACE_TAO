Test Description:

The test consists of several processes and the usual run_test.pl script.

controller.exe -- This is a simple corba wrapper around the ServiceConfigurator
                  which takes -c <cmd> and -r options to run a command and
                  reload the conf file respectively.

combined_service.exe -- It combines the tao imr locator, activator, and a dynamic
                        server in a single process. You can use any service
                        configurator command line options, and it also writes
                        out a combined.ior file that can be use d with the controller above.

test_server.exe -- This is a simple tao server that exposes two imr-ified objects
                   called TestObject1 and TestObject2. You must start it with
                   -orbuseimr 1 as usual.

dynserver.dll -- This is the same server as above, except for use with the ServiceConfigurator.
                 It exposes DynObject1 and DynObject2. This program is not currently used as
                 part of the run_test.pl

test.exe -- This is a simple client that invokes the test() operation on the Test object.
            Start it with -orbinitref Test=... It can be used against any of the
            four objects above.

There are also comments within the run_test.pl that describe the
test and expected results at various stages.
