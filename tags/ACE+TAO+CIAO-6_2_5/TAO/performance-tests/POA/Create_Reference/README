@page Create_Reference Performance Test README File

	This test measures the time required to create an object
reference using create_reference_with_id().  The test should be
extended to include POAs with the NO_RETAIN policy.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful, and prints
out the performance numbers.
