This is a regression test to demonstrate a problem in collocated invocation with SSLIOP in a separate thread.


How to Run:

1) Automatially:
./run_test.pl

2) Manually

To start the server:
------------------
./MessengerServer -ORBSvcConf server.conf


To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient -ORBSvcConf client.conf


Output:
NO_PERMISSION exception is thrown.

Note:
There is a workaround for this problem, i.e., just pass '-ORBCollocation no' to the server.
Also if the collocated invocation is in the same thread as the caller, it won't fail.
