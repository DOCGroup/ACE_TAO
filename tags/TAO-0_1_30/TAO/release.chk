Legend:
        Platforms are indicated by position within square brackets, i.e.,
        [ABCDEF] where

        A = Solaris/CC
        B = NT (MSVC++ 5.0)
        C = Solaris/g++
        D = IRIX
        E = Linux/g++
        F = Other (Linux/egcs, Solaris/egcs, etc.)

        The state is indicated as a tri-state value, e.g.,

        0 = doesn't work
        1 = works
        x = not attempted or unknown

NOTES
* Solaris/CC

** Thruput/TAO/server.cpp -same errors as Logger/svr.cpp
** ParamTest/var_struct,nested_struct,struct_seq - seg. fault , but
   able to fix manually the tao_idl compiler generated files, works
   fine then.

* NT
** Warnings on libTAO and tao_idl compilation.
** Param_Test with struct_seq segfaults server.
** MT_Cubit client segfaults after transactions made.

* Solaris/g++
** Warnings during tao_idl compilation.
** MT Cubit fails to link due to missing -lposix4 library

* IRIX
** Event Latency won't work because unproper detection of failures for
   priority change.
** MT_Cubit does not compile
   An extra library (-lposix4) is only present in Solaris; IMHO that
   should go into the platform file for Solaris/CC
** Param_Test does not connect on the first attempt, even for simple
   types like <short>

* Linux/g++
** IDL Cubit clnt works, but generates a SEGV on shutdown
** IDL Cubit svr executes, but returns object references across the
   wire with host of 127.0.0.1 The remote client gets a MARSHAL
   exception.

* Other (Linux/egcs, Solaris/egcs, etc.)
