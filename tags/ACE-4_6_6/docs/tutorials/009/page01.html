<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>In our previous tutorial, we created a datagram listener and a couple
of clients that would send it datagrams.&nbsp; That server would respond
to any datagram sent to the TCP/IP port at which the server was listening.&nbsp;
What we really want to do, however, is to have the server only respond
to clients that meet some criteria.

<P>Why is this important?

<P>Imagine you're writting a distributed system that will have many server
applications.&nbsp; Each of those will probably listen at different (and
well-known)&nbsp;TCP/IP addresses so that clients can find each server
without confusion.&nbsp; However...&nbsp; In a large system you might have
several <I>versions</I> of the same server running at the same time*.&nbsp;
You probably don't want those servers running at different addresses since
that breaks the well-known address requirement.

<P>By creating a datagram listener similar to the last tutorial, a client
can send broadcast datagrams to locate all of the servers listening at
the well-known address.&nbsp;&nbsp; By adding a thin protocol layer into
the datagram contents, the servers can be selective about which clients
they respond to.&nbsp; Thus, if each client sends its version signature
in the broadcast, then the servers can choose to respond only to clients
with matching versions.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>*Note:&nbsp; I'm making the assumption that your multiple
server versions will be running on different hosts since you can only have
one server listening at the well-known address on a given host.</FONT>
