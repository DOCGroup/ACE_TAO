   We try to keep main() very simple.  One of the ways we do that is to push
   much of the complicated stuff into worker objects.  In this case, we only

   port is 10002 (at least on my system) and that's good enough for what  we
   want to do here.  Obviously, a more robust application would take a command
   line parameter or read from a configuration file or do some other  clever

     acceptor.  If we wanted, though, we could create several of these  and

     addresses.  If not, there must be some mechanism by which the client is

     programming is a big thing in ACE, you should get used to it. If the
     signal handler catches something, the finished flag will be set and we'll
     exit.  Conveniently enough, handle_events() is also interrupted by signals 
     and will exit back to the while() loop.  (If you want your event loop to

<P>Hmmm... No change there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I should leave out comments
on the stuff I don't change.&nbsp; Let's take a look at client_acceptor.h.
