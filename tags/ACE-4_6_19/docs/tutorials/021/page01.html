      The previous two tutorials were very primitive & basic.  They
      showed very simple uses of shared memory and memory mapped
      files.
    <p>
      If we move the level of abstraction up just a bit, the next
      thing we encounter is memory pools.  ACE_Malloc&lt;&gt; provides 
      this to us.
    <p>
      In this tutorial, we'll use ACE_Malloc&lt;&gt; to create a
      memory pool that is sharable between a client and server.  We'll 
      use a memory mapped file to provide the physical storage but
      shared memory works just as well.
