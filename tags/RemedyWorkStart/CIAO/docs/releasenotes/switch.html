<h3>When switching from the old CIAO runtime to the new one</h1>

<ul>
  There are only one thing needs to be done to migrate the component
  implementation from the old runtime to the new runtime.
  <br><br>
  Find all the component MPC files in your component implementation
  source directories and make the following changes.

  for every project in your MPC files which inherites from any of
  the following MPC template (base project): <code> ciao_client, ciao_component,
  ciao_servant, ciao_server,</code> replace them with  <code> ciao_client_dnc,
  ciao_component_dnc, ciao_servant_dnc, ciao_server_dnc</code>. Then
  generate your makefile/solution/project files using either
  <code>mwc.pl</code> or <code>mpc.pl</code> and build (rebuild) your
  binaries.<br>

  A couple examples of the component implementation are at:
  <code>$CIAO_ROOT/tests</code>.
</ul>

<h3>When switching from the new CIAO runtime to the old one</h3>
  <ul>
    Reverse the above changes.
