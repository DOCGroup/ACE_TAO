Portable Interceptors


File: DevGuideExamples/PortableInterceptor/Auth/README


This directory contains an example illustrating client and server
Request Interceptors.

This is a simple insecure authentication example that is based on 
the Messenger example in GettingStarted directory.  A message is 
sent by MessengerClient and displayed by MessengerServer.  A client-side 
portable interceptor adds a username to each request sent to the server. 
A server-side interceptor verifies that the supplied username is valid.

How to Run
----------

To start the server:
------------------
./MessengerServer 


To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient
