Description:

        This test a modification of MT_Server.  In this case the client is also
multi-threaded.  The client sends very large strings to the server, which it
echoes back, for the sake of keeping the server busy doing I/O.  When the
client is abruptly killed, the server should close the connection and continue
running.

Expected output:
        The server prints out the IOR of the object it serves and the
results of server shutdown (aborted or shutdown cleanly).
