Introduction:

This example illustrates the usage of the QtReactor from TAO.  The
server creates a display dialog which has a lcd display. The client
creates a dialog with a quit button & a slider. On dragging the slider
the display on the server dialog box will change. On pressing the Quit
button the ORB would be shutdown and the movement of the slider will
NOT be communicated to the server. The user can kill the windows to
exit.

To run the server and the client simply do the following:

$ server -o foo.ior
$ client -k file://foo.ior

Note: this test only does something useful if the user has the Qt
library installed.  You should enable the build of the QtReactor by
initializing qt_reactor. The path should point to the Qt/bin area so
that the moc could be accessed by the Makefile.

Bugs:
It seems there is a problem with ORB shutdown, namely client does not
shutdown nicely after QUIT button. Needs some additional investigations.

Technical Description:
The technical details are similar to that of the XtReactor. Please
refer $TAO_ROOT/tests/Xt_Stopwatch/README for a good description.
