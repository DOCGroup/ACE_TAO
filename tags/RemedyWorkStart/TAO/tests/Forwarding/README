$Id$

	This is a minimal test for location forwarding.  It verifies
that the client ORB can process LOCATION_FORWARD replies correctly.
It takes advantage of the IORTable facilities in TAO to create a
simple corbaloc IOR, TAO always responds with a LOCATION_FORWARD
message when a requests is made for an object in the IORTable.

	The test tries to invoke a method on the object using both the
full IOR and the corbaloc IOR, both should work to pass the test
successfully.  The test was originally implemented because the ORB was
having problems with location forward messages received by a follower
thread.

	To execute the test simply run:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 on success and non-zero on failures.

@todo The test is not nearly a complete test for location forwarding,
      for example, it does not test deeeply nested location forwards
      or the interactions between location forwarding and multiple
      profiles.
