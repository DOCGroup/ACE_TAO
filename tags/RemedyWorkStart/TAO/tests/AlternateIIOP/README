	This test uses the binaries from the Hello test, but builds an
IOR that contains multiple endpoints. The "hostname_in_ior" option is
used to add two unreachable endpoints along with a third that is
successful.

- The ior file for the test, altiiop.ior is not unlinked at the end of
the test to allow for manual inspection using
$TAO_ROOT/utils/catior/catior.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
