Telecom Log Service (TLS) Client example
----------------------------------------
This is a simple example example to show how to create a notify log and write events
to the Log.

To run this example:
1) You need a running Naming Service, $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service
2) You need a running Notify Logging Service, $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service
3) To collect log-generated events you will need to run, ./Notify_Consumer
4) To run the sample log events run, ./Notify_Supplier

The client locates the log service factory from the naming service.
Then it creates a DsNotifyLogAdmin::NotifyLog does the following operations:
- writes records, query records, delete records.
