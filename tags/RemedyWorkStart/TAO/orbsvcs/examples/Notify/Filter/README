Filter example:

This example shows how to filter structured events in the Notification Service.

The Notification service must be up and running before launching this example.
(See the README under $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Notify_Service for more details.)

The example connects to the Notification Service's factory object and creates
an event channel. It then hooks up 2 suppliers and consumers with the EC.
The consumers and suppliers use the <TAO_Notify_StructuredPushConsumer> and
<TAO_Notify_StructuredPushSupplier> classes which are utility classes included
with the Notification Service to help developers write consumers and suppliers.

Both the suppliers send 30 events to the EC and contain the event property
"threshold".
Only events in the "threshold" range 10 to 20 are delivered to the consumers
because of the filters setup at the ConsumerAdmin and SupplierAdmin.

Similar filters can be setup in the ConsumerProxy and SupplierProxy classes.
