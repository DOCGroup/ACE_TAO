  This directory contains a very simple example of a
multicast-based federation of event services.

	The example is a single process that contains:

1) An event service
2) A supplier
3) A consumer
4) The gateways required to send and receive data through the
   multicast group.

	The tests should be executed as follows:

$ MCast

	If you need to set the multicast group and port you can use
the -m option:

$ MCast -m 224.100.2.1:12345

	Run the test in multiple machines on the same network.  If
there is only one process you should only receive 1000 events in the
local consumer.  If there is more than one machine you should receive
more events.
