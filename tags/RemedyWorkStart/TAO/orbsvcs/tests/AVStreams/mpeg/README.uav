The original MPEG player in this directory has been removed,
since it has been superceded by a better example, developed
jointly by BBN Technologies and OOMWorks.

The example is available here:
http://www.dist-systems.bbn.com/projects/AIRES/UAV/index.shtml

The members of the team which developed this software were:

Yamuna Krishnamurthy <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>, OOMWorks
Irfan Pyarali <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>, OOMWorks
Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>, BBN
