	This test can be used to measure the performance of TAO's
Real-time Event Service.  The test can be configured to change:

1) The number of suppliers connected to the event service.
2) The number of consumers connected to the event service.
3) The types of events generated by the suppliers and the consumer
   subscriptions.
4) The event payload size.
5) The number of events generated.
6) Events are sent in "burst", i.e. a number of events is
   generated without any pacing, the user can prescribe the number of
   events in each burst as well as the period between bursts.

        There are two versions of the test, a collocated version,
contained in the ECT_Throughput executable.  The non-collocated
version uses the event channel executable in the ../../Event_Service
direction, and two local binaries (ECT_Consumer and
ECT_Supplier).  Both versions require a Naming Service.

	To run the test you can use (as usual) the run_test.pl script
on this directory.  If you want to manually run the tests here are
some examples, usually each one of the commands below is executed on
its own window:

# Run the collocated test using the default configuration:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ./ECT_Throughput

# Run the non-collocated test using the default configuration:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ../../Event_Service/Event_Service
$ ./ECT_Consumer
$ ./ECT_Supplier

# Run the non-collocated tests using 4 suppliers, notice that the
# ECT_Consumer needs to know the number of suppliers to terminate
# correctly:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ../../Event_Service/Event_Service
$ ./ECT_Consumer -s 4
$ ./ECT_Supplier -s 4

	Other options for the tests can be obtained using the -?, for
example:

# Find out the options for the collocated test:
$ ./ECT_Throughput -?
