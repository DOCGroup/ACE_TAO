      This is a simple test to use BiDirGIOP to work with any corbaloc
URL's, such as the naming service. The test is ultra simple trying to
set BiDir policies and exporting a reference to an object to the name
service. The fun part is trying to contact the name service using
corbaloc URL's.

       The test is in the orbsvcs directory because the test uses the
NameService.
