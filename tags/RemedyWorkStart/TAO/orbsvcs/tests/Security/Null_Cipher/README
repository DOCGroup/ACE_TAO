This test verifies that a NULL cipher may be used. Sometime between
openssl release 0.9.7a and 0.9.8g, openssl changed the way it evaluated
cipher strings so that "DEFAULT:eNULL" no longer allowed use of a NULL
cipher. The correction is to have the SSLIOP Factory use "ALL:eNULL" as
the cipher string when -SSLNoProtection is used on the server side.

The test is a simple invocation, with qop and trust policies set to
force the use of a NULL cipher.

A failure is indicated by the server reporting an ssl handshake error.
A success is a silent termination of client and server.
