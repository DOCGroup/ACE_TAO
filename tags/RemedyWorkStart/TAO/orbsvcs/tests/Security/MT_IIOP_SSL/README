@page MT_IIOP_SSL Test README File

	This is a stress test for the IIOP_SSL features.  This test should
serve as a stress test for

http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1421

        If SSL cannot be used (for whatever reason) we expect the
communication to take place  over an insecure TCP/IP port. This test
just makes sure that the fallback port actually works!

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.

@NOTE:

       This test links *and* loads the SSLIOP library. They are needed
due to the way the test is setup.
