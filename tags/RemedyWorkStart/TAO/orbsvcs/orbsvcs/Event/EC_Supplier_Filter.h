/**
 * @class TAO_EC_Supplier_Filter
 *
 * @brief The strategy to filter close to the supplier.
 *
 * After an event is received by the a ProxyPushConsumer it must
 * be dispatched to the right set of ProxyPushSuppliers;
 * determining this set is the task of this class.
 * Notice that this is in fact a filter, and enforces (in part)
 * the subscriptions and publications of the Event Service
 * clients.
 * Several implementations are possible:
 * - Each ProxyPushConsumer keeps a list of ProxyPushSuppliers,
 * using the subscriptions and publications to find potential
 * matches.
 * - Each ProxyPushConsumer keeps several such lists, indexed by
 * event type and/or source, this has the advantage of further
 * minimizing the set of ProxyPushSuppliers invoked.
 * - A single list of consumers is kept (global for the event
 * channel), such a list results is faster updates and requires
 * an smaller memory footprint.
 * - Multiple global lists are kept, indexed by type and/or
 * source, this is a tradeoff between the solutions above.
 * - No list is kept, the events are sent to the consumers which
 * must filter out what they want, this is good when no
 * filtering is wanted or when the amount of filtering is coarse
 * i.e. each event goes to a large subset of the
 * ProxyPushSuppliers.
 * Different applications will require to use different
 * implementations of this class; as usual the EC_Factory will
 * create the right instance.
