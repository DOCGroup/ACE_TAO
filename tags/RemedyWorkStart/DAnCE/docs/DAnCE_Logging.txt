This file describes the various enviornment variables and command line
options used to configure the logging service in DAnCE.  In the case
where both an enviornment variable and a command line option are
available to a particular process, the value provided on the command
line takes precidence.

Preprocessor macro: DANCE_NTRACE

If this macro is set to 1, function level tracing will be compiled in
to DAnCE. Default is off.

Preprocessor macro: DANCE_NLOGGING

If defined, this macro will cause all logging statements to not be
compiled in to the DAnCE toolchain.

Preprocessor macro: DANCE_ERROR

Defining this macro will replace the default error logging behavior in
DAnCE.  For example, the following will disable all error logging in
DAnCE:

#define DANCE_ERROR(L, X) do {} while (0)

Preprocessor macro: DANCE_DEBUG
Defining this macro will replace the default debug logging behavior in
DAnCE.  For example, the following will disable all debug logging in
DAnCE:

#define DANCE_DEBUG(L, X) do {} while (0)

Preprocessor macro: DANCE_TRACE_LOG

Defining this macro will replace the default logging behavior in DAnCE
for the most detailed debug logging.  For example, the following will
disable all detailed debug logging in DAnCE:

#define DANCE_TRACE_LOG(L, X) do {} while (0)

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_LEVEL
Command line option:  -DAnCELogLevel

Values range from 0 to 10, with 1 being the default.  At zero level,
no logging messages are printed at all.  At the 1 level, only those
messages that cause a process to prematurely exit are printed.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_TRACE_ENABLE
Command line option:  -DAnCETraceEnable

If present, this turns on function-level tracing in DAnCE, only if the
toolchain was compiled with DANCE_NTRACE set to 0.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_LEVEL
Command line option:  -DAnCELogFile

If present, this redirects all log messages to the nominated file.
This will disable printing of log messages to standard error.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_BACKEND
Command line option:  -DAnCELogBackend

If present, this will load as a dynamic service the nominated
backend.  Note that the backend must be loaded via a svc.conf file,
and the value of this environment variable must match a valid dynamic
service identifier.


RTI DDS Logging Backend for DAnCE
==============================================
The RTI DDS logging backend is an example backend for the DAnCE
logging service that publishes log messages to DDS instead of standard
error.  The command line options described below should be provided as
part of the svc.conf file that configures the backend.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_NDDS_TOPIC
Command line option:  --topic

Sets the topic that log messages are published to.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_NDDS_DOMAIN
Command line option:  --domain

Sets the domain that the DDS entities are created in.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_NDDS_QOS_FILE
Command line option:  --qos-file

Sets the XML QoS file loaded at run-time.

Environment Variable:  DANCE_LOG_NDDS_NODE_NAME
Command line option:  --node-name

Sets the node name included as part of the log messages.
