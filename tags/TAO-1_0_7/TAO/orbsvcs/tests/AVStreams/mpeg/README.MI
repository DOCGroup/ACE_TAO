Hello animation addicts,

I'll be brief. This is the modified source of mpeg_play that has a new motif
user interface (finally!). I hope you will enjoy spending many hours using it!
This is a very rough first release and the source files + make files are not
particularly well organized. You might have to do a lot of hand tweaking to get
it to compile.

Here are some helpful hints:

/mib directory contains the source for my mib interface construction toolkit
     which is really just a wrapper around motif. This is the majority of the
     new code and is the same toolkit I used for the X11 version of Geomview
     (3d visualization program), also available via ftp from geom.umn.edu.

/interface directory contains the bitmaps for buttons, and the interface
     geometry specified with .mib files.

ui.c file contains the code which sets up the interface and processes button
     callbacks.

More minor modifications were made to gdith.c util.c util32.c and video.c.

To compile you will need a decent compiler (gcc works the best!), as well as
the X11, Xt, and Xm (motif) libraries.

You must first get mib/libmib.a to be created. The Makefile in /mib should take
care of this when properly tweaked. The main makefile should handle linking the
library into the mpeg_play binary.

If you have any questions or need help with the compile feel free to send me
mail, but I may take a while to respond. I tend to correspond with quite a
few people about many different things.

best wishes,
