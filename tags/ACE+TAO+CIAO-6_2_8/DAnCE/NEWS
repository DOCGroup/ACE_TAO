. Significant re-work of the internal DAnCE logging system.  Many log
  message levels have changed.  Details of the intended logging levels
  may be found in dance/Logger/Log_Macros.h

. The new default logging level in DAnCE is 1 instead of 0.  Messages
  at log level 1 will only be those errors that cause a premature exit
  of the process in question.

. A new logging macro, DANCE_LOG_TRACE has been added to the most
  fine-grained tracing messages.  This can be disabled to improve
  performance and footprint separate from more useful logging messages.

. Added capability to plugin custom log backends into the DAnCE
  logging service.  These backends must be loaded via a svc.conf file
  (please see tools/Logger_Backend/ndds/svc.conf) for an example, and
  are loaded via the DANCE_LOG_BACKEND environment variable or the
  DAnCELogBackend command line option.

. An example Logger Backend written against RTI DDS has been added.
  This backend is still in early stages of development and doesn't take
  advantage of QoS features of DDS.

. Error reporting has been substantially improved, and most exceptions
  should now be propagated to the user with a human-readable error message.

. DAnCE has been made an entirely separate product from CIAO, and has
  been moved from ACE_wrappers/TAO/CIAO/DAnCE to
  ACE_wrappers/TAO/DAnCE.

. The Config Handlers have been moved from the CIAO namespace to the
  DAnCE namespace.
