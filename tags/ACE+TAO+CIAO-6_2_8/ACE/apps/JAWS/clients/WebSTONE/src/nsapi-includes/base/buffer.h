/*
 * buffer.h: For performing buffered I/O on a file or socket descriptor.
 *
 * This is an abstraction to allow I/O to be performed regardless of the
 * current system. That way, an integer file descriptor can be used under
 * UNIX but a stdio FILE structure could be used on systems which don't
 * support that or don't support it as efficiently.
 *
 * Two abstractions are defined: A file buffer, and a network buffer. A
 * distinction is made so that mmap() can be used on files (but is not
 * required). Also, the file buffer takes a file name as the object to
 * open instead of a file descriptor. A lot of the network buffering
 * is almost an exact duplicate of the non-mmap file buffering.
 *
 * If an error occurs, system-independent means to obtain an error string
 * are also provided. However, if the underlying system is UNIX the error
 * may not be accurate in a threaded environment.
