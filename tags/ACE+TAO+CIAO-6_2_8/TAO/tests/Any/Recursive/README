/**

@page Recursive Any Test README File

This test determines whether insertion and extraction of recursive
types into and from a CORBA::Any, respectively, works.  Properly
functioning insertion and exctraction of recursive types depends on
working recursive TypeCode support, which is indirectly tested by this
test as well.

To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
