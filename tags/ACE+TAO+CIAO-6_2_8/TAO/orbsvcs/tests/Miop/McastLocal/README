@page McastLocal Test README File

This test is a copy of the McastHello test but modified so that the
servers are listening only on the loopback interface (via the
  "-ORBListenerInterface *=127.0.0.1" in the svc_server1.conf for server1
and the
  "-ORBListenerInterface CopyPreferredInterfaces" in the svc_server2.conf
and the server2's otherwise redundant command line
  "-ORBPreferredInterface *=127.0.0.1" orb_init parameter).
The client has also been modified to send the broadcast out on the
loopback interface (via its
  "-ORBPreferredInterface *=127.0.0.1" orb_init parameter).

This is testing that these configuartion options are correctly working
for MIOP.
***********************************
Note
This test currently fails on Solaris (at least ultra10)
as loopback multicasting seems to have a hardcoded (and unchangeable) SndSock
size of 0. It then throws away all data that is being sent by the client,
therefore the servers will timeout as they won't receive any message.

Some other systems (AIX and MacOS) also have problems with loopback
multicasting issuing errno such as "Network/address unreachable" for each
send.

This test should be disabled on such systems. There is a !NO_LOOPBACK_MCAST
config item in TAO/bin/tao_other_tests.lst to cater for this.
