The files in this directory support controlled benchmarking of the ACE
C++ wrappers for Solaris 2.x synchronization mechanisms.  These
mechanisms include:

	. Mutexes
	. Reader/writer locks
	. Condition variables
	. Semaphores (both Solaris and traditional System V)

There are additional tests that measure the memory bandwidth under the
following conditions:

	. User memory-to-memory copying of data within a single thread
 	. User memory-to-kernel-to-user memory copying via pipes
	  between separate processes, as well as between separate
	  threads in the same process

There are many options available for this program.  See the
Options.[Chi] file for more details.  Some reasonable options to use
to run the tests are:

% ./synch_driver -v -B -s 15
% ./synch_driver -v -n 4 -t 4 -s 15

You should experiment with other options as you see fit.  Note that in
general you should always make sure that you have more than 1 LWP (by
using either the -B or the -n options) since otherwise the program may
to into an infinite loop due to the semantics of SunOS unbound
threads...
