FindPOA test:
============

Executable:	FindPOA


Description:
===========
	This is a program to test the findPOA method of the POA. It makes use of TAO_Adapter_Activator.
	Adapter activators are associated with POAs. An adapter activator supplies a POA with the ability to create child POAs on demand
	, as a side-effect of receiving a request that names the child POA (or one of its children),
	or when find_POA is called with an activate parameter value of TRUE. An application server that creates
	 all its needed POAs at the beginning of execution does not need to use or provide an adapter activator;
	 it is necessary only for the case in which POAs need to be created during request processing.
		TAO_Adapter_Activator takes a '/' (backslash) separated string of POA names and creates them
	in a hierarchy with the left most substring as the root of that hierarchy.

		The test program tests the "findPOA" method in RootPOA with a single POA named "firstPOA" and
	then with a POA namestring "firstPOA/secondPOA". In the second case the secondPOA is
	non-existent and is created.
		Finally the findPOA method in RootPOA is called with a string "thirdPOA/forthPOA/fifthPOA",
	resulting in the creation of thirdPOA,forthPOA and a fifthPOA and returns the fifthPOA.

	To check the findPOA method the names of the POA are queried and printed on the screen. POAs hold only the
	name relative to its parent. For eg. the name of fifthPOA is just "fifthPOA" and NOT "RootPOA/thirdPOA/forthPOA/fifthPOA".

To Test:
========
	1. Just run the FindPOA program.

	2. You should see the following as the output:

		RootPOA
		firstPOA
		secondPOA
		fifthPOA

	3. There might be other diagnostic messages.
