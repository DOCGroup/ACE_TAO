The directory contains the source code that implements an Orbix
version of the distributed Logger.  Other ACE versions of this code
appear in the ./apps/Logger directory.  It is interesting to compare
and contrast the alternative implementations.

RUNNING:

The client is run as follows:

client -h host -m max_message_size

The -h host is optional if the locator service is properly configured.
The -m specifies the maximum number of kilobytes to be sent per log.  This
is useful when redirecting messages to stdin.

TIMING:

I recommend timing the log's by specifying a max_message_size and 
redirecting /usr/dict/words.  This will give you several trials from
which to take an average.

CLIENT:

While using the client and typing in messages manually, capital Q and V
must be used to quit and toggle verbose respectively.  This allows you
to redirect /usr/dict/words without quiting at the q's!!

SERVER:

To turn off message reporting on the server side, do a

setenv NO_MESSAGES

in the enviroment where the server will be run.  If this is done, the server
will only report that a message was received, but not display the messages.
