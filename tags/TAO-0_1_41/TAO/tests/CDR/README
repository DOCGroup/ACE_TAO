This directory contains two simple tests for the CDR stream class;

+ basic_types: simply encodes a lot of CORBA::Octets, 
    CORBA::Short and CORBA::Long into a CDR stream and then decodes
    them; verifying that the same results are obtained.

+ tc: TAO implements TypeCodes using a CDR buffer (this was
    inherited from the Sun IIOP engine), this test verifies thatn some
    of the basic TypeCodes actually are able to interpret their CDR
    buffers.

	Both tests take no arguments and return 0 on success.
