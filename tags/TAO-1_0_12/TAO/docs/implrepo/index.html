<h2>Implementation Repository in TAO</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Implementation Repository in TAO is for the automatic
activation of a TAO server when a method is invoked but the server is not
running. It does this by working with the server to keep track of when it is
activated and stores information on how to reactivate it. Method
invocations on the server will actually be sent to the Implementation
Repository, which will then be able to start the server process if it is not
already running and forward the invocation to the real server. </p>

<p>In the pages here (and in most of the documentation written for it),
Implementation Repository will often be shortened to ImplRepo or IMR.  It used
to be also shortened to IR, but that leads to confusion with the Interface
Repository.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The IMR in TAO was first based on a paper on the subject by <a href="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi-henning.html">Michi
Henning</a> called <a href="http://www.triodia.com/staff/michi/cacm.pdf">Binding,
Migration, and Scalability in CORBA</a>. Mr. Henning later went on to
coauthor the book <a href="http://cseng.awl.com/bookdetail.qry?ISBN=0-201-37927-9&amp;ptype=0">Advanced
CORBA Programming in C++</a> and included a chapter on the Implementation
Repository. The description of the IMR in this chapter is used as the
specification for TAO's IMR. </p>

<p><a href="usersguide.html">Users Guide</a> - Overall documentation on
how to use the IMR in your programs.</p>

<p><a href="tao_imr.html">tao_imr Guide</a> - Guide to the commands for the
tao_imr application.</p>

<p><a href="paper.html">The Paper</a> - A paper that has a general
description of the IMR. This is also where to look to find information on the
inner working of the IMR. Be warned, it was written a while ago and there has
been several changes since then in the implementation.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>As with any program, there is always a wishlist of things to do.</p>

<h3>Who wrote it?</h3>
<p>The guy currently in charge of the IMR is Darrell Brunsch &lt;<a href="mailto:brunsch@cs.wustl.edu">brunsch@cs.wustl.edu</a>&gt;.
You can reach me by either email (which is better), or through the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE
mailing list</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:ace-useres@cs.wustl.edu">ace-users@cs.wustl.edu</a>&gt;,
or through the <a href="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">comp.soft-sys.ace</a> newsgroup.
The newsgroup mirrors the mailing list, but not the other way. Also, if you use
the mailing list, it is best if you join it before sending a question since
responses are usually just replied back to the group.</p>
