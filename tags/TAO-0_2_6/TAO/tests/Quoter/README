Here is a Stock Quoter example that features the use of the TAO IDL
compiler, the different types of configuration settings (global vs
tss, etc), and the Life Cycle Service.

For your convenience, the run_test.btm has been provided.  It is a
batch file that runs under 4NT.  Work is in progress for a regular
batch file that performs the same action.

And we'll probably get it working on other platforms as soon as it
is completed [since I've heard that some people actually use 
platforms/opsystems besides NT ;-) ]
