      This is a simple test which tests the following

- If a client receives a location forwarding with a new IOGR  version,
  the next request from the client should have the new version in the
  FT_GROUP_VERSION context of the GIOP header

- that location forwarding to a FTORB actually works.

The test creates two IOR's and sets both of them as primaries. The
first IOR is passed to the client for making invocations. After a
certain number of invocations from the client, the server request
interceptor throw ForwardRequest exception with a reference to the
second IOR which also has new IOGR revision information. The
server side interceptor checks whether the subsequent calls have the
new version information.
