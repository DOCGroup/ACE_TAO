This directory contains a simple file transfer test program for the
Full Profile  in the TAO's Audio/Video Streaming Service.

This example follows the sequence of steps for using the Full Profile
as outlined in the following section of the Audio/Video Streams
specification:
http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/audio.htm
http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/2000-01-03

This is from Section 2.3.8, The FlowConnection:

===================================================================================
- User A adds some flowendpoints to an instance of a full profile implementation of
  StreamEndPoint_A (myA) by calling myA->add_fep(aFEP);
- User B adds some FEPs to an instance of a full profile implementation of
  StreamEndPoint_B (theirB).
User C creates a StreamCtrl and calls aSC->bind(myA,theirB,someQoS,nilflowSpec)

The bind() algorithm will find which pairs of FlowEndPoints are compatible
between myA and theirB and create a FlowConnection for each pair of
FlowEndPoints. Each flow connection within a stream can be individually
accessed and manipulated.
===================================================================================

This program can be run using UDP by default

Executable Options:
-------------------

server:
-------

-f <filename> -> The name of the file under which the received stream
                data has to be stored.

ftp:
----

-f <filename> --> The file to be streamed to the server. It is currently
                streamed at the rate of 0.5kbytes/s.

-s          --> flag to use SFP. This option cannot be used with -p
                TCP since SFP currently runs only over UDP.

Running the Test:
-----------------

In that order:

Run the Naming Service

server -f <filename>

ftp -f <filename> -p <TCP/UDP>
