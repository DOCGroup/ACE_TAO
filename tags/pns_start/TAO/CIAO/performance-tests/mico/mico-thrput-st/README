Throughput Experiment
====================

This experiment is used to gather latency and throughput related metrics for MICO ORB. 
The benchmark uses ACE to analyze the data sample and generate results. In order to run 
this benchmark the following is required

1: MICO ORB configured in single-threaded mode
2: This directory placed under $MICO_ROOT/demo/<name-of-directory>
3: The envrionment setting required for running this test is provided in 
   the mico-env file.
4: These tests can only run on *nix systems as of now. For windows project files will
   be added shortly
