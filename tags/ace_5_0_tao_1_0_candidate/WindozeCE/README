        CE specific files, may not run on 95/NT.

What is this directory:

        This directory contains a collection of files for a template
        windows program.  It is written with Microsoft's MFC classes.
        They also demonstrate a simple method to pass ACE_Log_Msg's
        output to a window program with PostMessage.

How to use this directory:

        I was planning to make this a DLL so that we can integrate CE
        project files with the current Win32 project files.  However,
        the CE toolkit still seems very rudimentary and, certainly, I
        am not familiar with it.  

        To use these files, simply include all .cpp and .rc files in
        your original text-based program.  Compile them with "using
        Shared MFC library" set (important.)

Running the programs:
        
        Start the program.  Key in command line parameters in the edit
        box and tap on start button.  The button displays "Running.."
        when the program is executing and "Stopped" after the ACE
        program has finished execution.

Future works:
     
        * We need to allow scrollable output.

        * Make this a DLL?

        * Get the command line automatically.  (This may need to
          rewrite the program using native Win32 APIs.)
