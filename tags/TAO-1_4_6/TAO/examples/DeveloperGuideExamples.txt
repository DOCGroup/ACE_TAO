The OCI TAO Developer's Guide contains source code for many examples.
These examples were developed independently by OCI and are tightly
integrated with the discussion of various topics in the TAO
Developer's Guide.  These examples are now part of the regular ACE+TAO
source code distribution available from OCI.

The source code for these examples is located in
ACE_wrappers/TAO/DevGuideExamples/.
