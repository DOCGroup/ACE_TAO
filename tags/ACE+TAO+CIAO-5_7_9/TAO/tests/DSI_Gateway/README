	A simple test for the DSI/DII gateway support. TAO can
optimize some demarshaling/marshaling and data copying in the
implementation of DSI/DII based gateways. The DSI/DII gateway can
also pass requests and replies that are not in native (the
gateway's) byte order. NOTE - For this last feature to work, you
must compile ACE with ACE_ENABLE_SWAP_ON_WRITE defined.

	This is a smoke test and simple example for those 
features. Use

        $ server -o server.ior
        $ gateway -k file://server.ior -o gw.ior
        $ client -k file://gw.ior -i 100 -x

or run the run_test.pl script.

        A second perl script, run_exception_test.pl,
tests the exception handling of the gateway. The script
runs the client twice, first calling a method that raises
a user exception (containing several fields of information),
then calling a method that raises a CORBA system exception.

        To run these tests by hand, start the server and gateway
as shown above, then use

        $ client -k file://gw.ior -u 

for the user exception test and

        $ client -k file://gw.ior -s 

for the system exception test. For these tests, the -x
option (server shutdown) and -i option (# of calls)
are inoperative.
