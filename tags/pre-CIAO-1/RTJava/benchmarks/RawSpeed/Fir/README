This package contains the implementation of a Finite Impulse Responce (FIR)
filter. This kind of filter appears in almost all embedde systems, and from
a computational point of view are characterized by tight computational loop.

This is then a good use case for evaluating the througput that could be
obtained using different RT Java implementation.

To run the test you need first to compile, in this case simply run:

$ make

Once you have done this you can use the script available to run the default
test cases.
