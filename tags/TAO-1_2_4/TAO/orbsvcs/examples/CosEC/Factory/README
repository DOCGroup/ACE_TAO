                        CosEventChannelFactory
        ======================================================

The CosEventChannelFactory is a factory for creating COS Event
Channels.  The ChannelFactory interface allows a client to create,
destroy and locate factories.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

The TAO_CosEventChannelFactory_i class implements the C++ servant for
the ChannelFactory interface.  The FactoryDriver class activates the
ChannelFactory servant with the ORB.  During initialization the
ChannelFactory creates a child POA which is used to activate all the
CosEC servants.The ChannelFactory uses the CosEC_ServantBase class to
create the CosEvent Channels.

The Makefile in this directory generates 2 executables: factory and
factoryclient.

FACTORY
=======

To allow client applications to obtain a reference to the factory, a
Naming service must be started prior to running the factory.

The factory options are:

        -r <FactoryName> : specifies under what name the factory should be

registered with the Naming Service. The default is "CosEC_Factory"

FACTORYCLIENT
=============

The factory client is a test driver for the factory. It exercises all
the features of the factory.  A Naming Service and a factory must be
running prior to running the factoryclient.  factoryclient does not
take any command line options.
