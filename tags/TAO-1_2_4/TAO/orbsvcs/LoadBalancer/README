This directory contains the sources for two binaries:

	1) LoadManager
	2) LoadMonitor

Descriptions of each follow.

LoadManager
===========
The "LoadManager" binary is the stand-alone load balancing/managing
service.

A listing of available "LoadManager" command line options is available
by invoking the "LoadManager" binary with the "-h" command line option.

LoadMonitor
===========
The "LoadMonitor" binary is a stand-alone load monitoring utility.  It
can be used to report loads for the standard load monitor types (CPU,
Disk, Memory and Network), in addition to custom load monitors.
A custom load monitor is used by passing its IOR to the "LoadMonitor"
utility through the "-m" command line option.

Both "PUSH" and "PULL" load monitoring styles may be configured.  The
"PUSH" interval may be configured, as well.

A listing of available "LoadMonitor" command line options is available
by invoking the "LoadMonitor" binary with the "-h" command line
option.

The LoadManager object's IOR must be made available to the
"LoadMonitor" binary.  This can be done using the standard
Interoperable Naming Service "-ORBInitRef" option.  For example, the
following will work if LoadManager IOR is available in the file
`lm.ior' 

	LoadMonitor -ORBInitRef LoadManager=file://lm.ior
