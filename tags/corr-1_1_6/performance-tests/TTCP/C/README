		TTCP for c_version, ACE-wrappers, ORBeline and Orbix
		----------------------------------------------------

This is the super-readme file for the "ttcp" code. This directory contains the C, ACE-wrappers,
ORBeline and Orbix versions of ttcp code. To compile the code, you have to do the following:

1. You should have ACE, ORBeline and Orbix installed in your system and configured correctly.
   (see the reference manual for installation and configuration procedure)

2. Copy this directory (ttcp) in the same directory structure to your disk space.

3. setup the following environment parameters (before compilation stage):
   ACE_ROOT, ORBELINE_ROOT, ORBIX_ROOT, LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For example:
ACE_ROOT=/project/adaptive/ACE_wrappers
ORBELINE_ROOT=/project/adaptive/ORBelineV1.2
ORBIX_ROOT=/project/adaptive/Orbix
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/project/adaptive/ORBelineV1.2/lib
		:/project/adaptive/ACE_wrappers/build/SunOS5.4/src
		:/project/adaptive/Orbix/lib

4. Do make (using GNU make) in this directory level. This will create the executable ttcp
   target code for each ttcp version.

5. Read the README or How_to_run_tests file existing in each directory to know how to use the 
   executable.

6. Have fun.
