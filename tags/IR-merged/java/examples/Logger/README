This directory contains a simple client/server Java implementation of the
distributed logging server described in several papers in the C++
Report (which can be obtained via the following WWW URLs:
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/{Reactor1-93.ps.gz,Reactor2-93.ps.gz}).

The example consists of the following two directories:

	. client
		NOT YET CONVERTED
		This program talks directly to the server logging
		daemon.  The server daemon must be started before you
		can run this test. 

	. simple-server

		This program runs a simple
		implementation of the
		distributed logging server daemon.  It also contains
		code for a simple client as well.

	. Acceptor-server
		NOT YET CONVERTED
		This program runs templated, Acceptor-based
		single-threaded Reactive implementation of the
		distributed logging server daemon.

The server implemented in "simple" is completely compatible with the
client defined in the C++ version of ACE.
