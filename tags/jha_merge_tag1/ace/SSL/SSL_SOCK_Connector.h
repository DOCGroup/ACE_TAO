/**
 * @class ACE_SSL_SOCK_Connector
 *
 * @brief Defines a factory that creates new <ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream>s
 *        actively.
 *
 * The ACE_SSL_SOCK_Connector doesn't have a socket of its own,
 * i.e., it simply "borrows" the one from the ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream
 * that's being connected.  The reason for this is that the
 * underlying socket API doesn't use a "factory" socket to connect
 * "data-mode" sockets.  Therefore, there's no need to inherit
 * ACE_SSL_SOCK_Connector from ACE_SSL_SOCK.
