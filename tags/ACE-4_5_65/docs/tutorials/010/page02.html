<P>
This looks a lot like our thread-pool server and it even does some things
better.  In particular, I've scoped the Task object so that it's destructor
will have a chance to get called before the application exits.
Notice how we write actual data into the message block though.  In the thread-pool
server we just provided a pointer.  Writting the data is actually a more correct
way of doing things since you don't get into strange pointer casting situations.
What if you want to put complex objects into the message block though?  We'll do
that in the next tutorial, let's stick with the basics first.

On the next page we'll take a look at our Block object...
