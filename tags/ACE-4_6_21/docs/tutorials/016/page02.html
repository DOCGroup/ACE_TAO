We'll look first at the declaration of the wrapper class.
<P>
The way you use ACE_Condition is something like this:
<UL>
<LI>First, the setup...
<UL>
<LI>Create a variable using your choice of data types
<LI>Create a mutex that will provide thread-safe access to that
variable
<LI>Create an ACE_Condition that uses the mutex
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Waiting for the condition...
<UL>
<PRE>
the_mutex.acquire();
while( the_variable != some_desired_state_or_value )
	the_condition.wait();
the_mutex.release();
</PRE>
Note that when <i>the_condition</i> is created, it must be given a
reference to the mutex.  That's because the wait() method will release 
the mutex before waiting and reacquire it after being signaled.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Setting the condition...
<UL>
<PRE>
the_mutex.acquire();
the_variable = some_new_value_or_state;
the_condition.signal() <i>OR</i> the_condition.broadcast()
</pre>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
The problem I have is remembering to setup everything and co-ordinate
the locking, waiting and signaling.  Even if I remember it all
correctly it just makes my application code more complex than it
should be.
<P>
To help out with that, I've created the class below to encapsulate the 
three elements necessary for the condition to work.  I've then added
methods for manipulation of the condition variable and waiting for the 
condition to occur.

<font color=red>/** A wrapper for ACE_Condition&lt;>.  When you're using an
    ACE_Condition&lt;> you have to have three things: - Some variable
    that embodies the condition you're looking for - A mutex to
    prevent simultaneous access to that variable from different
    threads - An ACE_Condition&lt;> that enables blocking on state
    changes in the variable The class I create here will contain those
    three things.  For the actual condition variable I've chosen an
    integer.  You could easily turn this clas into a template
    parameterized on the condition variable's data type if 'int' isn't
    what you want.  */</font>

  <font color=red>/* I've created a number of arithmetic operators on the class that
     pass their operation on to the variable.  If you turn this into a
     template then some of these may not be appropriate...  For the
     ones that take a parameter, I've stuck with 'int' instead of
     'value_t' to reinforce the fact that you'll need a close look at
     these if you choose to change the 'value_t' typedef.  */</font>

  <font color=red>/* These four operators perform the actual waiting.  For instance:

     operator!=(int _value)

     is implemented as:

     Guard guard(mutex_)
     while( value_ != _value )
     condition_.wait();

     This is the "<font color=green>typical</font>" use for condition mutexes.  Each of the
     operators below behaves this way for their respective
     comparisions.

     To use one of these in code, you would simply do:

     Condition mycondition;
     ...
     <font color=red>// Wait until the condition variable has the value 42</font>
     mycondition != 42
     ...  */</font>

  int operator!= (value_t value);

  <font color=red>// As long as the condition variable is EXACTLY EQUAL TO &lt;value>, we</font>
  <font color=red>// wait</font>
  int operator== (value_t value);

  <font color=red>// As long as the condition variable is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO</font>
  <font color=red>// &lt;value>, we wait</font>
  int operator&lt;= (value_t value);

  <font color=red>// As long as the condition variable is GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO</font>
  <font color=red>// &lt;value>, we wait</font>
  int operator>= (value_t value);

  <font color=red>// Return the value of the condition variable</font>
  operator value_t (void);

  <font color=red>/* In addition to the four ways of waiting above, I've also create a
     method that will invoke a function object for each iteration of
     the while() loop.  Derive yourself an object from
     <font color=#008888>Condition::Compare</font> and overload operator()(value_t) to take
     advantage of this.  Have the function return non-zero when you
     consider the condition to be met.  */</font>
  class Compare
  {
