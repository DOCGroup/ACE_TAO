<P>Two new files this time.&nbsp; The first is <A HREF="thread_pool.h">thread_pool.h</A>
where we declare our Thread_Pool object.&nbsp; This is responsible for
abstracting away the thread pool implementation details and allowing us
to make so few changes to the rest of the code.

<P>Well, that doesn't look too complex.&nbsp; What about the implementation?
