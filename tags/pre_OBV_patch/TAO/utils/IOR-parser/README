// DESCRIPTION        : Description of the IOR Parser

The "ior-parser" utility parses IORs generated by most ORBs. It has been
tested with Orbix, VisiBroker and TAO so far.

USAGE: ior-parser <IOR filename>

There are sample IORs (Tao.IOR, Orbix.IOR and Visibroker.IOR) in this
directory.  You can run the "ior-parser" utility against these to see
what the normal output looks like. 

RELEASE NOTES:

The "ior-parser" does not currently work if multi-component profiles are
embedded in the IOR. Since Visibroker IORs normally contain
multi-component (LIOP and IIOP) profiles, this version of the IOR Parser
will work only if the Visibroker server is forced to generate a
single-component (IIOP) profile by passing it the command-line option
"-OAlocalIPC 0".
