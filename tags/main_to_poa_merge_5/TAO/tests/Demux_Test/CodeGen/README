This directory contains a code generator that will generate stubs and
skeletons for an interface called "tao_demux". The number of
operations in this interface is controlled by the -m option to the
executable "tao".

Usage:

tao -o <num of objs> -m < num of operations>

The stubs and skeletons are for 2-way calls. The operation names and
object keys are automatically generated and have arbitrary string
names.
