  Building and Installing TAO
  
   TAO has been ported and tested Windows NT, Solaris, VxWorks, and
   Linux. I expect that major portions of the release will port easily to
   other platforms that ACE has been ported to. If you can help port TAO
   to other platforms we'd appreciate it.
   
   TAO can be obtained [1]electronically via the WWW and ftp. Besides
   getting the [2]TAO release you will need [3]ACE. You will likely need
   the most recent [4]beta version of ACE because TAO tends to track
   changes to ACE rather closely.
   
   A quick build note for users who have used ACE with other ORBs:
   linking TAO with a version of ACE that must also be linked against
   another ORB vendor's library, e.g., liborbix.so, will produce
   undefined and most likely unpredictable and erroneous results.

  On UNIX platforms
  
    1. Set ACE_ROOT environment variable as outlined in the [5]ACE
       installation notes.
    2. Build and install ACE under $ACE_ROOT.
          + Change directory to $ACE_ROOT/ace and execute [6]make.
    3. Set TAO_ROOT environment variable to $ACE_ROOT/TAO.
    4. Build and install the TAO release under $TAO_ROOT.
          + Change directory to $TAO_ROOT/tao and execute [7]make.
    5. Change directory to $TAO_ROOT/tests and execute [8]make.
    6. Follow instructions on executing the various examples under
       $TAO_ROOT/tests.
       
    A Note On Make
    
   Since TAO is built atop ACE, TAO re-uses ACE's Makefile structure as
   well. Thus, just like ACE requires GNU Make, so too does TAO. More
   exactly, versions of make which are known to not work include those
   from Solaris 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX, the latest BSD, etc.
   
   GNU Make can be obtained from various places in source form.

  On Windows NT
  
   Before compiling TAO_IDL on NT, you may need to set the environment
   variable CPP_PATH to where CL.exe is installed on your machine. By
   default, we set this variable to to "C:/Program
   Files/DevStudio/VC/bin". Your location may vary, however. Notice that
   if you forget to set this variable, you must rebuild TAO_IDL after
   setting it.
   
    Visual C++ 5.0
    
   It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
   ACE_wrappers\TAO because the Visual C++ 5.0 Project files are set up
   to work in this configuration. If you move it, then make sure you
   change the project file to look for the include and library files in
   the correct place.
   
    1. Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 5.0, use ace.dsw or
       ace-vc50.dsw, whichever is in your copy of ACE).
    2. Load the workspace tao\TAO.dsw and build the TAO library.
    3. To build the Cubit test, load the workspace
       tests\Cubit\TAO\test.dsw and build both client and server.
       
    Visual C++ 4.x
    
    1. In Tools|Options, go to the Directories page and make sure that
       include files paths includes ACE_wrappers\ and the root directory
       of TAO (which can be ACE_wrappers\TAO if installed there). The
       library files paths should include ACE_wrappers\ace.
    2. Load the project file tao\TAO.mdp and build the TAO library.
    3. To build the Cubit test, load the project file
       tests\Cubit\TAO\test.mdp and build both client and server.
