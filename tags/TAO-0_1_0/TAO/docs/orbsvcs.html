   <H1>TAO Services Directory Hierarchy</H1>

    <P>The file and directory organization for TAO services can be
      confusing at first glance (and even on subsequent ones to be
      honest),
      so we felt like some rationale and explanation of the directory
      hierarchy was needed.</P>

    <P>For general sanity all TAO services files are located under 
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs</CODE>.
      The current structure for this directory emphasizes the
      decoupling from the interfaces (stubs) and their
      implementation;
      for this reason the services implementations are each on a
      separate directory,
      for instance <B>Naming Service</B> is in
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service</CODE>.</P>

    <P>It is expected that clients use more
      than one service at the same time
      (in fact some of the services already do, for instance the
      <B>Event Service</B> uses the <B>Naming Service</B> and the
      <B>Scheduling Service</B>);
      for this reason all the services stubs are grouped in one
      library;
      this library is located in
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs</CODE>.
      Usually the include path is only <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs</CODE>,
      so files are included like in:</P>

<P><CODE>
#include "orbsvcs/CosNamingC.h"
</CODE></P>

    <P>To simplify the IDL generation the skeletons are also on the
      library,
      this is not a problem for client programs and most services need
      to link the library anyway
      (since they use other services.)</P>

    <P>Finally some test are located in
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests</CODE>,
      since most tests require several files each one has its own
      directory.</P>
