      This tutorial mirrors the previous.  Instead of using shared memory,
      this time we'll be using a memory-mapped file.
    <p>
      The cool thing about doing it this way is that we gain
      persistence of memory even across reboots.  I wonder if you
      could memory map a file that's mounted via NFS?
    <p>
      Like the shared memory tutorial, this one is also very basic and 
      primitive.  I'm assuming you've read that one, so I'll just hit
      the high points this time through..

Kirthika's abstract:
<UL>
Here, the ACE_Shared_Memory_MM class has been used to provide
persistence of the contents of the shared memory resource used by 
the server and client. A memory_map which is really a file mapped onto
memory appears like an array which can be
easily manipulated  while actually the data is stored in a file thus
making the contents permanent. In the previous tutorial, this wasnt
possible as we were dealing with shared memory allocated from the RAM.
<P>
Again, here too, the example consists of a server and a client sharing
memory
(the mem_map) and the server writing a a-z string to it which will
be successfully converted to uppercase by the client.
<P>
Notice that, similarities in usage abound between the previous and the
current tutorial which will prove to be a force for templatisation.
For that we need to go ahead -- to the next tutorial!
