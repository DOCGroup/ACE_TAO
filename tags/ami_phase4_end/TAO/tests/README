This directory contains a number of tests to validate that TAO is
functioning correctly.  The individual directories contain READMEs on
how to run the following tests:

        . CDR

          This directory contains several tests for the CDR stream
          class. 

        . DynAny_Test
        
          Tests TAO's DynAny feature, which allows composition and
          decomposition of arbitrarily complex CORBA::Any values at
          runtime, without requiring any compile-time knowledge of the
          IDL. 

        . Multiple_Inheritance

          This test exercises IDL interfaces that inherit from
          multiple interfaces.

        . NestedUpcall

          Tests TAO's nested upcall feature, which allows
          single-threaded clients and servers to perform callbacks on
          each other without deadlocking.

        . OctetSeq

	  Measures the cost of marshaling and demarshaling of
          sequences of octets of different sizes. NOTE: TAO optimizes
	  this so the cost should be constant!

        . Param_Test
 
          Tests all the features of TAO's protocol engine.
