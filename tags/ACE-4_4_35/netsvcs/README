This directory contains the ACE network service implementations and
sample driver programs for dynamically configuring them into client
and server processes.  The subdirectories include the following:

	. lib -- contains implementations of the ACE network services.
	  These services include a logging service, a name service,
	  a distributed locking service, and a distributed time service.
	  These can be built as shared libraries (i.e., DLLs), which
	  are then linked into applications either statically or
	  dynamically.
	
	. servers -- contains the driver program that links the various
	  services together, either statically or dynamically, to 
	  form complete server programs.

	. clients -- contains a number of test programs that illustrate
	  how to write clients for the various ACE network services.

Please see the ACE-netsvcs.html file for an overview of the various
services.
