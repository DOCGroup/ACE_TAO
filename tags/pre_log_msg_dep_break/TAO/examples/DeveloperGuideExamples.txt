The OCI TAO Developer's Guide contains source code for many examples which 
are not part of the regular ACE+TAO source code distribution available from
the Center for Distributed Object Computing at Washington University.  These
examples were developed independently by OCI and are tightly integrated with
the discussion of various topics in the TAO Developer's Guide.

The source code for these examples is available for download from the 
following site:

<http://www.theaceorb.com/TAO/Support/tao1.0a_example_source_code.html>

After downloading and extracting the example source code, you will find
a subdirectory corresponding to each of several chapters in OCI's TAO
Developer's Guide.
