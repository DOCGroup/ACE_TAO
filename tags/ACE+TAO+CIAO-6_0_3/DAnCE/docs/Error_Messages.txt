This file collects obscure error messages that may occur while
deploying applications using DAnCE.


Error Message:
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-close.c: 743: _dl_close: Assertion
`map->l_init_called' failed!

Cause:
This error message may occur when one library which is
explicitly loaded (e.g., a component implementation) links another
library that is explicitly loaded (e.g., another component
implementation or a deployment interceptor).  This error message is
emitted from the low-level Linux libraries like ld.so. While this
error is inoccous, and appears only on shutdown, it can be problematic
for automatic error detection scripts.  This can be addressed by
refactoring the code such that the shared code is in a seperate, not
explicitly loaded library.
