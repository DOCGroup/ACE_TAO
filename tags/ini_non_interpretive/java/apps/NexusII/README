This is the README file. This distribution contains the NexusII
server, which is a java application that can be started by a command
similar to the one contained in the sample "start" shell-script.

It also contains a "start.html" file, which serves as an example on how
a client applet can be included within a .html file.

A sample use of this, alongwith a simple users manual, can be found at
http://cumbia.cs.wustl.edu/NexusII/

Compiling (optional, all the class files are already present)
-------------------------------------------------------------

All the source .java files, alongwith the makefile should be placed in
the  same directory, and can then be compiled using make. 

The client/server use the following packages:

        awtCommand: This package provides a GUI toolkit for the applet
        ACE:        This is used both by the client/server for
                    networking. ACE documentation can be found at:
                    http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html
                
Running
-------

See the "start" and "start.html" files for examples on how to run the
server and client applet, respectively. The "mywebaddress" variable is
the "temporary" URL of the server, and the "mywebdir" variable is the
temporary directory in which images are cached by the server. Make
sure that both these exist and are world-readable. The "mywebdir"
should be writable to by the server. The "mywebdir" and "mywebaddress"
variables should thus point to the same location, of which mywebdir
contains the path, and mywebaddress contains the URL. 

See "start" for an example on how to do this.

If you only want to use an existing running server, all you need to
know is the server host-name and port number, and you can directly run
the start.html file via appletviewer.

Notes
-----

1. You can compile the client and server using the same makefile.
2. The client applet MUST reside on the same host as the server is running on.
4. run the server using start script. Change the paramters in the start script,
   suitable to your configurations. The start script contains further
   information on this.
