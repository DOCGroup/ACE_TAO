This directory contains a simple file transfer test program for the
Pluggable Data Protocols in the TAO's Audio/Video Streaming
Service. This program can be run using UDP,TCP and SFP over UDP.

server:
-------

-f filename -> The name of the file under which the received stream
                data has to be stored.

ftp:
----

-f filename --> The file to be streamed to the server. It is currently
                streamed at the rate of 0.5kbytes/s.

-p protocol --> The protocol string could be UDP or TCP.

-s          --> flag to use SFP. This option cannot be used with -p
                TCP since SFP currently runs only over UDP.
