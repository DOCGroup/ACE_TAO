   * Since SSLIOP profile is an extension of IIOP profile, its

   * contains all iiop addressing while this class contains
   * ssl-specific addressing additions to iiop.  This means that
   * there are two lists of endpoints: one maintained in the parent
   * class and one maintained here.  Each ssl endpoint maintains a
   * pointer to its counterpart in the parent class endpoint list.
   * @par
   * For transmission of iiop addressing information, see
   * TAO_IIOP_Profile.  Addressing info of the default ssl endpoint,
   * i.e., head of the list, is transmitted using standard
   * SSLIOP::TAG_SSL_SEC_TRANS tagged component.  See
   * <encode_endpoints> method documentation above for how the rest of
   * the ssl endpoint list is transmitted.
