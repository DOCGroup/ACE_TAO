   Our client handler must exist somewhere in the ACE_Event_Handler object
   hierarchy.  This is a requirement of the ACE_Reactor because it maintains
   ACE_Event_Handler pointers for each registered event handler.  You could
   derive our Client_Handler directly from ACE_Event_Handler but you still have
   to have an ACE_SOCK_Stream for the actual connection.  With a direct
   derivative of ACE_Event_Handler, you'll have to contain and maintain an
   ACE_SOCK_Stream instance yourself.  With ACE_Svc_Handler (which is a
   derivative of ACE_Event_Handler) some of those details are handled for you.

     creating a new Client_Handler when a client connects. Notice that the
     parameter to open() is a void*.  It just so happens that the pointer
     points to the acceptor which created us.  You would like for the parameter
     to be an ACE_Acceptor<>* but since ACE_Event_Handler is generic, that

     clean itself up. Since an event handler can be registered for more than
     one type of callback, the callback mask is provided to inform
     handle_close() exactly which method failed.  That way, you don't have to
     maintain state information between your handle_* method calls. The _handle
     parameter is explained below...
     As a side-effect, the reactor will also invoke remove_handler()
