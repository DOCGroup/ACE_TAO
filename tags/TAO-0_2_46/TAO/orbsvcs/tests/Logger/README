This example tests the TAO logging service. It generates SII stubs and
skeletons using the TAO IDL compiler.  You can either run the client
and server as seperate processes in the same, or different windows (or
machines), or you may run the "runtests.pl" script which will start
both executables.

By default, the client and server use the Naming Service. The
log_server has its own NamingServer implementation, so it doesn't
require you to start the NamingService before starting the client and
server.

The test demonstrates the functionality of the logging service. The
client program will generate 4 logging messages which will be logged
to the screen. The first message will be in the "verbose_lite"
format. The rest will be fully verbose messages. Successful output is

LM_DEBUG@::log() test (1)

server: ------

% server [-d]

client: -------

% client [-d]

Options: -------

-d Debug flag. It is an additive flag, so more -d's will increase
	the debugging level. Only one flag is necessary to enable the
	debugging output from the executables, but the debug level
	affects how the utilized TAO methods act (including mysterious
	debugging messages).

That's all there is to it. If you desire, feel free to change the
logging priorities, verbosity levels and messages in the client
program but note that the maximum length of the message is 1023
characters.
