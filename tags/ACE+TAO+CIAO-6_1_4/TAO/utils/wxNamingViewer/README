wxNamingViewer - a wxWindows implementation of NamingViewer
Author: Charlie Frasch <cfrasch@atdesk.com>

Based on NamingViewer by Chris Hafey (chris@stentorsoft.com)


1. This is an (almost) exact port of NamingViewer to wxWindows. There are some
differences and a few minor improvements. The port was done with
ACE 5.1.4/TAO 1.1.4 and wxWindows 2.1.5 on Borland C++ Builder 4. Chris Hafey
contributed changes for MSVC. It has recently (11/11/03) been updated for
ACE 5.3.1/TAO 1.3.1, wxWindows2.4.2 and linux.

*) put <null> as the "root" of the naming context if a naming service cannot be
found

*) allows definition of objects with no valid IOR, uses CORBA::Object::_nil().

*) uses Profile::to_string() to generate the profile(s) in the View IOR dialog

*) minor changes to dialogs to enable and disable controls as appropriate

*) added Edit menu with Copy item


2. Limitations.

*) (still) does not support circularly defined naming contexts.


3. To build.

For Borland C++ Builder:

*) Obtain, make and install wxWindows. See http://www.wxwindows.org.

*) Obtain ACE/TAO. See http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html.

*) Build the the dynamically linked release version of ACE and TAO. See
http://www.tenermerx.com/programming/corba/tao_bcb/index.html.

*) Make the wxNamingViewer using either the command line compiler with
make -f makefile.b32 (set ACE_ROOT as usual; set BCCDIR to your C++ Builder
install directory) or use the C++ Builder IDE (double-click on
wxNamingViewer.bpr. You may need to modify the include and library paths to
suit your particular installation.


For linux/gcc:

*) Obtain, make and install wxWindows. See http://www.wxwindows.org.

*) Obtain ACE/TAO. See http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html.

*) Build the the dynamically linked release version of ACE and TAO.

*) optionally use MPC to generate the makefile

  -) enable the wxwindows feature
     vi $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features
     and add/change
      wxWindows     = 1

  -) build the Makefile
     cd $TAO_ROOT/utils
     mwc.pl -type gnuace -recurse

*) Make the wxNamingViewer
   must have wxWindows=1 on make line or in
   $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

For others: (TBD)
