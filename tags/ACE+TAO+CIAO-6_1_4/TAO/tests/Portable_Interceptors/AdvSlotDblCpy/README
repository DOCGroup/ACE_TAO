The test should complete without exceptions or asserts.

This test checks that simply calling GetSlot works at every
Server side interception point.

This used to trigger the following assert in the send_reply
interception point if the slot had not actually been updated
after the RSC->TSC logical copy that occurs after the
"receive_request_service_contexts" (such as in the
"receive_request" or the actual IDL interface implementation
code) before the logical copy TSC->RSC that then occurs
before the "send_reply" interception point.

send_reply -> get_slot(TSC) -> long (62) SERVER
send_reply -> get_slot(RSC)
ACE_ASSERT: file ...\TAO\tao\PI\PICurrent_Impl.cpp, line 53
assertion failed for 'this->lc_slot_table_ !=
&this->slot_table_'.Aborting...

This test also checks that the set_slot(RSC) does not effect
the TSC that exists before the first logical copy (at the end
of receive_request_service_contexts) and after the second
logical copy that occurs after the IDL interface implimentation
call (i.e. during send_reply).

The run should look like this:
