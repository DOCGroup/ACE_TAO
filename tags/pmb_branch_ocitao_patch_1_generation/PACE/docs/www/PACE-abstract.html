          <h2>PACE Abstract</h2>
          
          <p>PACE is a POSIX compliant middleware library that was 
            written to allow developers to use one common programming
            API to access POSIX semantics across multiple, different
            operating systems, some of which are not currently POSIX
            compliant.
          </p>
          
          <p>PACE is part of the open source ACE+TAO library/framework
            and its implementation was initiated in response to the RT
            DII COE project at BOEING that specifically targeted
            operating systems NT4 SP6, LynxOS 3.1.0a and SunOS 5.8.
            The RT DII COE project wants to build a Mission Application
            Independent programming framework described as an
            architecture, an approach, a collection of reusable software,
            a software infrastructure and a set of guidelines and
            standards. The proposed framework consists of three layers:
            the kernel, the data exchange layer and common Support
            Applications.
          </p>
          
          <p>Such an ideal framework demands a strong, robust
            infrastructure and as such, ACE+TAO was chosen to be part
            of this project. ACE is the TAO developers API, essentially
            making TAO platform independent (or dependent on which platform
            ACE is ported to). As such, ACE provides very high level
            abstractions and key pattern techniques but handles different
            platforms, especially non-POSIX platforms, on a case-by-case
            basis (Win32 and VXWorks are two good examples).
          </p>
          
          <p>PACE was born to abstract support for current and additional 
            non-POSIX platforms away from ACE, thus, becoming an API for
            ACE developers to write to. Initial PACE support was limited
            to the previously mentioned DII COE platforms. Funding is now
            available to PACE to more of the platforms ACE supports,
            potentially encapsulating all of the platforms ACE currently
            supports. This will help separate the concerns of the current
            ACE+TAO framework so that:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>(PACE = low level, operating system middleware)</li>
            <li>(ACE  = high level, pattern oriented abstraction API)</li>
            <li>(TAO  = open source ORB)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In addition to presenting some of the PACE code, I intend to 
            discuss some of the pitfalls of porting middleware and how we 
            overcame them in our current work on PACE as well as how they 
            should be addressed as PACE continues to grow.
