-a	Generate ANSI standard C output code, i.e., function prototypes.
-c	Generate comparison code using strncmp rather than strcmp.
-C	Make the contents of generated lookup tables constant, i.e., readonly.
-d	Enables the debugging option (produces verbose output to the standard error).
-D	Handle keywords that hash to duplicate values.  This is useful
	for certain highly redundant keyword sets.  It enables the -S option.
-e	Allow user to provide a string containing delimiters used to separate
	keywords from their attributes.  Default is ",\n"
-E	Define constant values using an enum local to the lookup function
	rather than with defines
-f	Generate the gen-perf.hash function ``fast.''  This decreases GPERF's
	running time at the cost of minimizing generated table-size.
	The numeric argument represents the number of times to iterate when
	resolving a collision.  `0' means ``iterate by the number of keywords.''
-g	Assume a GNU compiler, e.g., g++ or gcc.  This makes all generated
	routines use the ``inline'' keyword to remove cost of function calls.
-G	Generate the static table of keywords as a static global variable,
	rather than hiding it inside of the lookup function (which is the
	default behavior).
-h	Prints this mesage.
-H	Allow user to specify name of generated hash function. Default
	is `hash'.
-i	Provide an initial value for the associate values array.  Default is 0.
	Setting this value larger helps inflate the size of the final table.
-j	Affects the ``jump value,'' i.e., how far to advance the associated
	character value upon collisions.  Must be an odd number, default is 5.
-k	Allows selection of the key positions used in the hash function.
	The allowable choices range between 1-126, inclusive.  The positions
	are separated by commas, ranges may be used, and key positions may
	occur in any order.  Also, the meta-character '*' causes the generated
	hash function to consider ALL key positions, and $ indicates the
	``final character'' of a key, e.g., $,1,2,4,6-10.
-K	Allow use to select name of the keyword component in the keyword structure.
-l	Compare key lengths before trying a string comparison.  This helps
	cut down on the number of string comparisons made during the lookup.
-L	Generates code in the language specified by the option's argument.  Languages
	handled are currently C++ and C.  The default is C.
-n	Do not include the length of the keyword when computing the hash function
-N	Allow user to specify name of generated lookup function.  Default
	name is `in_word_set.'
-o	Reorders input keys by frequency of occurrence of the key sets.
	This should decrease the search time dramatically.
-p	Changes the return value of the generated function ``in_word_set''
	from its default boolean value (i.e., 0 or 1), to type ``pointer
	to wordlist array''  This is most useful when the -t option, allowing
	user-defined structs, is used.
-r	Utilizes randomness to initialize the associated values table.
-s	Affects the size of the generated hash table.  The numeric argument
	for this option indicates ``how many times larger or smaller'' the associated
	value range should be, in relationship to the number of keys, e.g. a value of 3
	means ``allow the maximum associated value to be about 3 times larger than the
	number of input keys.''  Conversely, a value of -3 means ``make the maximum
	associated value about 3 times smaller than the number of input keys.
	A larger table should decrease the time required for an unsuccessful search,
	at the expense of extra table space.  Default value is 1.
-S	Causes the generated C code to use a switch statement scheme, rather
	than an array lookup table.  This can lead to a reduction in both
	time and space requirements for some keyfiles.  The argument to
	this option determines how many switch statements are generated.
	A value of 1 generates 1 switch containing all the elements, a value of 2
	generates 2 tables with 1/2 the elements in each table, etc.  This
	is useful since many C compilers cannot correctly generate code for
	large switch statements.
-t	Allows the user to include a structured type declaration for 
	generated code. Any text before %% is consider part of the type
	declaration.  Key words and additional fields may follow this, one
	group of fields per line.
-T	Prevents the transfer of the type declaration to the output file.
	Use this option if the type is already defined elsewhere.
-v	Prints out the current version number
-Z	Allow user to specify name of generated C++ class.  Default
	name is `Perfect_Hash.'
