This program tests the infrastructure controlled membership support
of the Cygnus Load Balancer. The aim is to allow Cygnus to set the
factories needed to create the "replicas", when the object group
is created. This way, the load balancer can decide when to create
the object group members.

Please see $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Loadbalancing for the implementations
of the Cygnus load balancer.
