examples/NotifyService/SupplierSideNC/README

This directory contains a simple example of using the Notification Service.

This example extends the Messenger example in Filtering directory 
to illustrate how the Notification channel can be used to push messages
from the supplier to the consumer. Furthermore, this example shows
how you could set up filters so that only a certain events are 
passed to the consumer.
 
This example uses the push/push model.

In this example, the Notify Service initiation is incorporated into the 
MessengerServer.

The MessengerSupplier in this example plays the role of a server for
the MessengerClient and the role of a supplier for the MessengerConsumer. 
The flow of messages is shown below:

MessengerClient->(MessengerSupplier->NotificationChannel)->MessengerConsumer.
