# Note 1: the above file from ACE 4.6 has been modified by Mike P. to get 
# rid of thread related stuff until we can obtain fsu-threads library.
#
# Note 2: You must setup FSU_PTHREADS_DIR environment var to your FSU
# pthreads directory.  

# Requires gcc 2.7.2 Skunkware 97
# to produce libACE.so correctly changed the specs file for gcc 2.7.2
# for not link -lc and -lgcc and other not shared libraries
