# SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2.x) with Sun C++ 4.2 and 5.x, *not* using Orbix.
#
# NOTE: Sun C++ 5.0 users might need to add this to their CCFLAGS:
#   -compat=4 and/or remove -instances=explicit.  Please note that
#   inlining is disabled by default with Sun C++ 5.0.  If you'd like
#   to try enabling it, comment out the "inline = 0" line below.
#
# To enable compilation of 64-bit binaries with Sun CC 5.0, a
# platform_macros.GNU file such as this can be used:
#     fast=1
#     include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU
#     CCFLAGS += -xtarget=ultra2 -xarch=v9a #### CPU specific!
#     SOFLAGS += -xtarget=ultra2 -xarch=v9a
#     LDFLAGS += -L/opt/SUNWspro/SC5.0/lib/v9 -L/usr/lib/sparcv9
# Please note that the xtarget and xarch settings are specific to
# the target CPU.  The /opt/SUNWspro/ Sun C++ installation directory
# is site-specific.
#
# With slight modification, this file could be used with Sun C++ 4.1.
# However, it's likely that you won't be able to build all of ACE
# with Sun C++ 4.1.
#
# NOTE: some ACE files might generate this warning:
#   "Warning: Could not find source for " one of the following:
#    default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, or assignment
#    operator.  It appears that with +w, Sun C++ 4.x issues this warning
#    whenever it has to generate one of these functions (because it wasn't
#    defined by the user).  This isn't really a problem.
#    This warning appears to be fixed by Sun C++ 4.2 jumbo patch 104631-02.
#
# -pta instantiates all template members, which makes libraries bigger.
# But, it's supposed to put each member into it's own .o, so executable
# size should not be penalized.  We don't use it because it's not
# necessary with automatic template instantiation.
