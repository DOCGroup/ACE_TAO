<H3>Modified Version of the OSE Documentation Tools</H3>

This <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-bin/">directory</A>
contains versions of the freely available <A
HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/">OSE</A> tools modified by <A
HREF="mailto:kdorn@erlh.siemens.de">Karlheinz Dorn</A>, which were
originally written by <A HREF="mailto:grahamd@nms.otc.com.au"> Graham
Dumpleton</A> I (<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">Doug
Schmidt</a>) am very grateful to Graham and Karlheinz for these tools.
You can obtain these files via the <A HREF="ACE-obtain.html">ACE</A>
release. <P>

The primary goal of the modifications was to create a <EM>class</EM>.hxx and
<EM>class</EM>.cxx file (for each class, struct, union included within the
original ACE header file) from the ACE *.h header files by collecting
the comments from that file and feeding them into the newly created
files, but keeping the ACE *.h file untouched. <P>

This helps when making product documentation using commercial
documentation tools (e.g., <A HREF="http://www.k2.co.uk">George</A>,
<A
HREF="http://www.zib.de/Visual/software/doc++/index.html">doc++</a>,
etc.)  by feeding in these newly created files with a customizable
layout.  The modifications are an upgrade to the original OSE-tools,
but many bug-fixes are also done for the OSE-tool files (some are
listed below). <P>

Incidentally, the Classinfo tools in OSE have evolved independently
since the copies in ACE were made and they support new features not
supported in the ACE version of the tools.  Certain subtle changes
were also made in the ACE copies for indicating sections,
<em>etc.</em>, which makes them different from the OSE
documentation. <P>

Karlheinz's extensions make it easy to include new ACE versions into
commercial documentations without doing any painful modifications of
the deltas within a frozen ACE-version or directly within ACE source
files when a new release arises. <P>

The following changes were made to the original OSE tools:

<UL>

<LI> The vendor headers can be suppressed within the hiding.fmt file,
so it is possible to generate <EM>class</EM>.cxx and
<EM>class</EM>.hxx files consisting only of pure class description
(hxx) and pure prototypes (cxx). Look at the vendor.fmt file and
change the field <EM>vendor</EM> in replacing it with your company
identifying line. <P>

<LI> Added a new script class2hxxcxx for making a <EM>class</EM>.hxx file for each
  class, struct, union included in an ACE *.h file as well as a *.cxx
  file that includes the correct prototypes for all classes within that
  *.h file. <P>

<LI>  Added new script info2headsrc for creating a <EM>class</EM>.hxx file for each
  class, struct, union included in an ACE *.h file as well as a <EM>class</EM>.cxx
  file that includes the correct prototypes for that class. <P>

<LI> added a new script class2hxxcxxsingle for the feature listed above. <P>

<LI> added a new format file named "hiding.fmt" to control more fine grained output 
  of a class in separating/suppressing PUBLIC, PROTECTED, PRIVATE parts of a 
  class, struct, union for output explicitly. <P>

<LI> added a new format file named "vendor.fmt" to control vendor specific 
  compilation-unit headers as well as class and method headers for the newly 
  created <EM>class</EM>.hxx and <EM>class</EM>.cxx files. The information for these headers 
  is collected from the headers and comments of the according ACE *.h files. <P>

<LI> changed info2doc and info2src for the features listed above. <P>

<LI> added the ability for handling multiline ENUMs properly (class2info,info2doc). <P>

<LI> added the ability for handling operator functions properly (info2src). <P>

<LI> added the ability for handling template functions properly (info2src). <P>

<LI> added the ability for handling nested classes, structs, unions properly
  by introducing gawk-function recursion within info2doc (class2info, 
  info2doc, info2src). <P>

<LI> added the ability for handling default values properly (info2src). <P>

</UL>

<HR><P>
<H3>Known Bugs</H3>

Some bugs inherited from the original OSE-tools are remaining. So the
developer of the *.h files should the following keep in mind:

- do not write multiline inheritance! <P>

INCORRECT: <P>

<pre><code>
  class x :
        public y
  {
  }
</pre></code>

CORRECT: <P>

<pre><code>
  class x : public y
  {
  }
</pre></code>

- do not write multiline templates!<P>

INCORRECT: <P>

<pre><code>
  template &ltclass t,
            class&gt
  class x 
  {
  }
</pre></code>

CORRECT: <P>

<pre><code>
  template &ltclass t, class u&gt
  class x 
  {
  }
</pre></code>
