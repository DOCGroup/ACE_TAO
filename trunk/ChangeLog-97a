	* ace: Replaced all uses of "delete mb" with mb->release ();

	* ace/Stream_Modules.cpp: Replaced the use of explicit bit
	  twiddling with the ACE_BIT* macros.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Make sure that we use the
 	  allocator_strategy_ to create the memory for the reference count
 	  since this may need to go into shared memory if that's the
 	  memory pool where the Message_Block allocations are coming from.

	* ace/OS.h: Added two new macros, ACE_ALLOCATOR_RETURN and
	  ACE_ALLOCATOR, which are similar to ACE_NEW_RETURN and ACE_NEW, 
	  except that these

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (release): Make sure to "delete this"
 	  outside the scope of the locking_strategy_.

	* ace/Service_Object.cpp: Added a destructor to ACE_Service_Type.
  	  Thanks to Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for
 	  suggesting this.

	* ace/Service_Object.i: Be smarter about how we reassign the name_
 	  pointer, i.e., delete the old one and make a copy.  Thanks to
 	  Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Module.cpp (open): Rearranged the assignments to
 	  reader_q->mod_ and writer_q->mod_ so that we don't try to
 	  initialize through NULL pointers.  Thanks to
 	  Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Service_Record.cpp (ACE_Service_Record): Initialized name_
 	  to NULL so that the following change works correctly now.
  	  Thanks to Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/Service_Record.i (name): Make sure to delete [] (char *)
 	  this->name_ before allocating a new one.  Thanks to
 	  Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Message_Block: Reworked the reference counting implemention
 	  so that reference counts are shared correctly amongst their
 	  various owners.  This requires making a deep copy the "header"
 	  portion, but a shallow copy of the "data."

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Message_Block): Updated all three
 	  ACE_Message_Block constructors so that they all call the init()
 	  method.  This centralizes all the initialization logic in one
 	  place.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Message_Block): Make sure to set the
 	  cont_ field to 0 after "releasing" it so that we don't
 	  mistakenly think it's still around later on.  This problem arose
 	  in the ACE_Message_Queue::close() method, which was trying to
 	  count the number of bytes being freed.

	* ace/Message_Queue.cpp (close): Fixed a subtle bug where we
 	  weren't actually deleting messages from the
 	  ACE_Message_Queue::close() routine.  This should work now...

	* ace/Message_Queue.cpp (close): Replaced the use of "delete mb"
 	  with "mb->release()" since the Message_Blocks are now reference
 	  counted.  

	* ace/Message_Block: Enhanced the reference counting scheme so
 	  that you can increment and decrement the count by an arbitrary
 	  amount.  This is particular useful when you know you'll be
 	  sending the same Message_Block to N consumers.

	* ace/Singleton: The dump() must be used same as instance()
          (without supplying an object) so it must be declarated *static*,
	  i.e.,

	  static void dump (void);

	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting
 	  this.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server: Completely rewrote and retested the
 	  ACE Event Server example.  The new code is *much* easier to
 	  understand, has many more comments, is more robust, and compiles
 	  much faster since I removed many of the templates.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Tranceiver/tranceiver.cpp: Fixed the
 	  tranceiver so that it shuts down correctly when the Event_Server
 	  exits.

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.cpp: Fixed a
 	  problem where we were trying to select() on ACE_STDIN on Win32.
  	  Naturally, this doesn't work, so we used the
 	  ACE::register_stdin_handler() to fix this.  Thanks to
 	  Samuel_Bercovici <Samuel_Bercovici_at_EFT__AD2@mail.icomverse.com>
	  for reporting this.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Options: Changed the
 	  Options class to be a Singleton...

	* ace/Task.h: Added "const" method qualifier to accessor methods
 	  like is_reader() and is_writer().

Wed Jan  1 00:10:47 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Message_Block: Added a new static release() method that
 	  behaves like the non-static method release(), except that it
 	  checks if <mb> is 0.  This is similar to CORBA::release(), which
 	  is useful if you want to eliminate lots of checks for NULL
 	  pointers before calling release() on them.

	* Updated all places in ACE where we use
 	  ACE_Event_Handler::READ_MASK when we should be using
 	  ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK.

	* examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_Thr_Stream.cpp:
 	  Changed the name of the acceptor class from Handle_Thr_Stream to
 	  Handle_Thr_Acceptor, which is more accurate.

	* ace/Reactor: Since we've now got an
 	  ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK (intended primarily to accept
 	  connections asynchronously using Win32 overlapped I/O) we can
 	  now use this with the ACE_Reactor, as well.  In particular, any
 	  time that we are registering a "passive-mode" socket acceptor we
 	  can now specify ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK.  This is much
 	  more intuitive than using the READ_MASK (which never made any
 	  sense...).  The ACE_Reactor now treats the ACCEPT_MASK as a
 	  READ_MASK internally, so you can still use READ_MASK if you'd
 	  like (i.e., this change doesn't break any existing code).

	* ace/Event_Handler: Changed "get_priority" and "set_priority" to
 	  simply "priority(void)" and "priority(int)" to be more
 	  consistent with other parts of ACE.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Updated the Gateway so that the
	  concurrency strategies can now be specified on the
	  command-line (or in the svc.conf file), rather than being
	  determined at compile-time.  This is much more flexible.
	  See the ./apps/Gateway/Gateway/README file for details.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Verified that all the multi-threading
 	  strategies still work.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Message_Block): Make sure that we
 	  "release" the continuation field, rather than delete it, since
 	  its reference count may be > 1.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Change the abort_prog logic a bit so that
 	  we always print a message to stderr if we're exiting,
 	  regardless...  Thanks to David Levine for pointing this out.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Moved all of the configuration file
 	  parsing logic *outside* of the Event_Channel into the Gateway
 	  class so that we wouldn't have unnecessary dependencies.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Redesigned the Gateway so that the
 	  Proxy_Handlers (i.e., the Consumer_Proxy and Supplier_Proxy)
 	  most of their work to the Event_Channel.  This "lightweight
 	  proxy" design is an improvement since it is now possible to
 	  emulate the COS Event Channel semantics within the Event_Channel
 	  "kernel."

	* Happy new year!  Let's start a new ChangeLog to celebrate the
	  new year.
