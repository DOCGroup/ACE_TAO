Wed Apr 09 16:46:16 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.{h,i}: fixed readPPCTimeBase declaration and return
	  value (for now: it really needs to return a 64 bit quantity).
	  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for
	  reporting these.

Tue Apr  8 00:04:22 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace: Changed the signature of all the make_svc_handler() methods
 	  so that they return int (rather than SVC_HANDLER *) and they
 	  pass back a SVC_HANDLER * by reference.  This makes it possible
 	  to totally control the creation of svc handlers (which is useful
 	  for the new ACE_Strategy_Connector).

	* ace/Connector.cpp: Factored out the active_svc_handler() call
 	  from the connect_svc_handler() method into the connect() method
 	  so that it would behave correctly as a Template Method and
 	  Strategy.

	* ace/Connector: Removed the explicit use of the Reactor data
 	  member from the ACE_Connector since it's inherited from the
 	  ACE_Service_Object.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: The MVS compiler doesn't like the call to
 	  atexit() in ACE_Log_Msg::instance() because atexit() requires an
 	  a function pointer of type extern "C" for its parameter.  I've
 	  fixed this via an adapter.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr
 	  <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/Strategies_T: Added a new ACE_Connect_Strategy that
 	  complements the ACE_Strategy_Connector in the same manner that
 	  the ACE_Accept_Strategy complements the ACE_Strategy_Acceptor.

	* ace/Connector.h: The destructor for ACE_Connector should have
 	  been virtual.  Now it is.

	* ace/Connector: Added a new factory method called
 	  make_svc_handler().  This behaves similiarly to the
 	  ACE_Acceptor::make_svc_handler().  However, for the
 	  ACE_Connector we only use this when the SVC_HANDLER * is NULL.

	* ace/Connector: Changed the signature for connect() to take a &
 	  to a SVC_HANDLER * in anticipation of our new
 	  ACE_Strategy_Connector.  This new connector will make it easy to
 	  implement cached connections.

	* ace/config-win32-common.h: Added a new #include for <mswsock.h>,
 	  which contains the declarations for TransmitFile() data
 	  structures.  They are in WINSOCK.H if you do not use
 	  ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2.  Thanks to Norbert Rapp
 	  <norbert.rapp@nexus-informatics.de> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i: Fixed a typo in the new condition variable
 	  implementation for Win32.  Thanks to Norbert Rapp
 	  <norbert.rapp@nexus-informatics.de> for reporting this.

Wed Apr  9 03:12:24 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-win32-common.h: Defining _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0400
 	  implies ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2.
	
	* ace/Asynch_IO: The implementation of ACE_Asynch_Transmit_File
 	  and ACE_Asynch_Accept are only supported if ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2 is
 	  defined or you are on WinNT 4.0 or higher. Therefore, added
 	  appropriate #defines.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
 	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for suggesting this.

Tue Apr  8 22:45:28 1997  Prashant Jain  <pjain@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* java/src/SOCKStream.java (SOCKStream): Made two small changes to
 	  the two send(). Instead of doing a println, I now do a
 	  print. This was really a bug!

Tue Apr 08 22:08:12 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++_4.1.GNU: removed
	  "rm -f $@" from AR command so that archive won't be removed
	  during incremental updates.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr
	  <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting this.

Tue Apr  8 00:04:22 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Task_T.cpp: Added a hack to work around the new weird HP/UX
 	  aCC template semantics.  Thanks to Neil B. Cohen
 	  <nbc@metsci.com> for reporting this.
 
	* ace/config-hpux-10.x[-g++].h: Added #define
 	  ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME.  Thanks to Neil B. Cohen <nbc@metsci.com>
 	  for reporting this.

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x[-g++].h: Added ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST and removed
 	  ACE_LACKS_STRRECVFD.  Thanks to Neil B. Cohen <nbc@metsci.com>
 	  for reporting this.

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x.h: Apparently some HP/UX 10.x C++ compilers
 	  don't support volatile, so I #defined it away as a macro.
  	  Thanks to Neil B. Cohen <nbc@metsci.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Put a #if defined (ACE_MT_SAFE) around the
 	  entire Log_Msg destructor.  Thanks to Neil B. Cohen
 	  <nbc@metsci.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x[-g++].h: Added #define ACE_HAS_STREAMS on
 	  the recommendation of Neil B. Cohen <nbc@metsci.com>.

Mon Apr 07 12:08:21 1997    <harrison@samba.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Set.cpp: For some reason, VC++ 5.0 doesn't like to have the
 	  constructors X::X(X&) and X::X(X*).  We can change the X::X(X*)
 	  constructor to take in an extra argument with a default value.
  	  This seems to have sufficiently satisfied the VC++ 5.0 for the
 	  time being.  There were no changes necessary to other Set.cpp
 	  code (as the extra argument has a default value).

Mon Apr 07 08:05:03 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-win32.h: enabled ACE_HAS_UNICODE by default.
	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for
	  suggesting this.

	* ace/config-sunos5.4-g++.h: enabled ACE_HAS_BROKEN_RANDR and
	  disabled ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T.  Thanks to Joey Zhu
	  <joey.zhu@wcom.com> for reporting these problems and testing
	  the fix.

	* ace/Proactor.h (ACE_Proactor): commented out unused arguments
	  in non-WIN32 version.

Sun Apr 06 22:51:02 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

	* ace/Proactor: Complete rewrite of Proactor that pushes all the
 	  differences in asynchronous I/O to the edges of the framework -
 	  i.e., into the new Asynch_IO classes. This allows the Proactor
 	  to easily support new asynchronous operations.

	  Currently, the new Proactor supports minimal functionality. In
 	  the future, we will complete this.

	  The Proactor is used in conjunction with the new Asynch_IO
 	  classes.  There is a different class for each operation. Please
 	  see Asynch_IO.h for details.

	  There is also a new ACE_Asynch_Acceptor that uses AcceptEx.

	  Example is in:
 	  ACE_wrappers/examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp.  

	  This example illustrates how the ACE_Proactor can be used to
 	  implement an application that does various asynchronous
 	  operations.

	* apps/JAWS/server: Complete rewrite of JAWS. The new JAWS has
 	  support for Asynch-Thread-Pool (on WIN32), Synch-Thread-Pool,
 	  and Thread-per-Request. Different models can be configured using
 	  the svc.conf file.  The server now supports both GET and PUT
 	  commands.
	  
	  The HTTP_Handler class is a state based implementation of the
 	  HTTP protocol. Therefore, it can be used synchronously and
 	  asynchronously. It uses an abstract IO class to move between
 	  different HTTP protocol states. It is up to the IO class to
 	  decide on synchronous or asynchronous I/O.

	* apps/JAWS/client: This is an example of the implementation of
 	  BlobStreaming in ACE. This version of BlobStreaming uses HTTP as
 	  a transport protocol. 

	  Blobby :-) is a simple application written using the ACE_Blob
 	  class, which is capable of doing both file uploads and
 	  downloads.  If a file is downloaded, the downloaded data is sent
 	  to standard output, so that it can be piped as necessary.

	* ace/Mem_Map.cpp (map_it): This method now uses ACE_OS::pwrite
 	  (if ACE_HAD_P_READ_WRITE is defined) instead of
 	  ACE_OS::lseek/ACE_OS::write to write the end-of-file byte. The
 	  old scheme does not work if the file is in OVERLAPPED mode.

	* ace/OS: Added pread and pwrite to the OS class (if
 	  ACE_HAD_P_READ_WRITE is defined). On Win32, these functions use
 	  the OVERLAPPED structure to specify the offset. This
 	  implementation will block until the write/read completes (even
 	  if the file is in OVERLAPPED mode).

	* ace/config: Added ACE_HAS_P_READ_WRITE to the following
	  platforms that support pread() and pwrite() calls:
	  config-sunos4-g++.h 
	  config-sunos4-lucid3.2.h
	  config-sunos4-sun3.x.h 
	  config-sunos4-sun4.1.4.h
	  config-sunos4-sun4.x-orbix.h 
	  config-sunos4-sun4.x.h
	  config-sunos5.4-centerline-2.x.h 
	  config-sunos5.4-g++.h
	  config-sunos5.4-sunc++-4.x-orbix.h
	  config-sunos5.4-sunc++-4.x.h 
	  config-sunos5.5-g++.h
	  config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.1.h	
	  config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.x-orbix.h
	  config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.x.h 
	  config-sunx86-sunc++-4.x.h
	  config-win32-common.h

Sun Apr  6 14:16:18 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp: Added tests to make sure that the
 	  new ACE_Timer_Queue::cancel() logic is working correctly.  So
 	  far, it seems to be fine.

	* ace/Timer_{Heap,List}.cpp (cancel): Changed the comparison for
 	  dont_call_handle_close to be correct.

	* ace/OS.cpp: Deleted a useless return.  Thanks to Gonzalo
 	  A. Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for reporting this.

	* ace/config-irix6.2-sgic++.h: Added the following definitions:

	  + ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_THR_SIGSETMASK
	  + ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_EQUAL
	  + ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_T
	  + ACE_HAS_SYSENT_H
	  + ACE_HAS_SYSINFO
	  + ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS

	  Deleted the following definitions:

	  + #define ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST (Irix's compiler only has a
	    _sys_siglist array when compiling their own internal
	    functions).

	  Thanks to Gonzalo A. Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for this.

	* ace/Process: Added new support for setting the environment
 	  variable and the current working directory.  Thanks to Gonzalo
 	  A. Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for this enhancement.

	* ace/OS.h: "sys/stat.h" was being included more than once, so I
 	  fixed this.  Thanks to Gonzalo A. Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl>
 	  for reporting this.

	* ace/XtReactor.cpp: Added the register_handler_i() method, which
 	  just delegates to the one defined in the Reactor.  This is
 	  necessary to adjust to the C++ type system rules.  Thanks to
 	  Gonzalo A. Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for reporting this.

	* ace/Service_Config.cpp: Added the Double-Checked Locking
 	  Optimization pattern to all the ACE_Service_Config Singletons
	  (e.g., thr_mgr(), reactor(), etc.) so that they behave correctly
 	  in multi-threaded programs.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
 	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for insisting on this.

	* ace/OS.i (nanosleep): If the nanosleep() system call isn't
 	  supported by the OS platform we'll just use ACE_OS::sleep(const
 	  ACE_Time_Value &) instead.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Changed the logic of
 	  ACE_Log_Msg_Manager::remove() so that it returns the number of
 	  remaining registered instances.  When this goes to 0 we'll
 	  cleanup.

	* ace/OS.i: Enhanced the ACE_OS::cond_[timed_]wait() methods so
 	  that they use SignalObjectAndWait() whenever possible to avoid
 	  potential problems with unfairness.  See
 	  http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/editorial-15.html for more
 	  details.  Thanks to David Holmes <ltdholmes@mri.mq.edu.au> for
 	  pointing out this subtlety.

Sun Apr 06 20:01:57 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: added "purify" and
	  "quantify" make command options.  To build Purified versions
	  of all executables in the current direction, for example:

		% make clean; make purify=1

	  These options assume that purify or quantify are in your PATH.

	* ace/Task.{h,cpp}: removed ACE_LACKS_STATIC_DATA_MEMBER_TEMPLATES
	  from ACE_Task_Exit declaration and ACE_Task_Exit::instance ().
	  ACE_Task_Exit is no longer a template class, so we don't need that.

	* ace/Task_T.h: added missing "*/" at end of comment after #endif.

	* tests/IOStream.cpp (server): added check for 0 strlen of
	  "buf" to avoid out-of-bound array reference.

	* ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp, Makefile: added #define ACE_BUILD_DLL.
	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for
	  reporting this.

	* ace/Set.cpp(ACE_Set_Node ctor): commented out unused arg MS_SUCKS.

Sat Apr  5 14:21:29 1997  Prashant Jain  <pjain@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* java/: Changed package name from ACE to JACE across all directories.

Sat Apr  5 13:12:37 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/MM_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp: Removed the use of dynamic
 	  memory allocation to avoid memory leaks.

	* ace/Service_Config: Changed _defaults to _static_svcs since this
 	  more accurately reflects what they do.

	* examples/Shared_Malloc/test_malloc.cpp: Removed the
 	  print_stats() call since it doesn't work via this API.  Thanks
 	  to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting this.

	* ACE-install.sh: Tweeked the install script by changing the
	  "gunzip; tar; gzip" sequence into "gunzip -c | tar xvf -" to
	  speed it up a little.  Thanks to Per Andersson
	  <Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se> for this fix.

	* examples/Threads/future1.cpp: Make sure to delete the char *name
 	  that is retrieved from the future in order to avoid a memory
 	  leak.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for
 	  figuring this out.
	
	* examples/Threads/future1.cpp: Make sure to delete this->name_ in
 	  the Scheduler destructor to avoid a memory leak.

	* examples/Threads/task_four.cpp (close): Enhanced the close()
 	  method so that it will actually delete the memory for the
 	  Worker_Task.

	* ace/XtReactor.cpp (register_handler_i): Added the 

	  if (mask & ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK)
	    ACE_SET_BITS (condition, XtInputReadMask);

	  Thanks to Jean-Marc Strauss <strauss@club-internet.fr> for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/Timer_Queue.cpp (expire): This is the only method that calls
 	  ACE_Timer_Queue::cancel() with dont_call_handle_close set to 0.

	* ace/Reactor: Modified the cancel_timer() methods so that they
 	  also take a dont_call_handle_close parameter and pass it on to
 	  the Timer_Queue::cancel() method.

	* ace/Timer_{List,Heap}.cpp: Modified all the cancel() methods so
 	  that they will not call handle_close() unless the new parameter
 	  dont_call_handle_close is 0 (it is 1 by default).  This will
 	  avoid nasty problems with recursion.  Thanks to Paul Han
	  <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for suggesting this.

	* ace/Timer_{List,Heap}.cpp (schedule): If a user tried to
 	  schedule a NULL ACE_Event_Handler then we return -1 with errno
 	  set to EINVAL.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Somehow the file got screwed up and was
 	  reverted back to an earlier incarnation where we didn't use
 	  ACE_Service_Config::alloc()...  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
 	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for figuring this out.

Sat Apr  5 19:11:46 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Signal.i (ACE_Sig_Guard): Changed the constructor of
 	  ACE_Sig_Guard so that it doesn't call ACE_OS::sigprocmask for
 	  Win32.  This keeps errno from being set to ENOSYS at random
	  times.

Sat Apr 05 17:27:02 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

	* Registry.cpp (resolve): Type and size of the object is only set
 	  if RegQueryValueEx() returns success. Thanks to Alan
	  (Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com) for reporting this.

Sat Apr 05 13:11:04 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (instance): Added another ACE_NO_HEAP_CHECK.
	  Matthias provided the fix.

	* ace/config-win32.h: Disable ACE_HAS_STRICT by default, because
	  it will break existing application code.

	* ace/OS.{h,cpp},Log_Msg.{h,cpp}: fixes from Matthias Kerkhoff
	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> to avoid memory-leak reports when MFC
	  or (the CrtHeapXXX()-functions of the Win32 runtime library)
	  are used.

	  The problem is, that MFC (and so may other Win32 applications
	  do) allocates a thread specific storage slot for each running
	  thread which contains various control and debug informations.
	  Part of this information is an object, which when constructed
	  makes a snapshop of the heap. When this object is destroyed,
	  the snapshot is compared to the actual heap. All object still
	  existing on the heap are reported as memory leaks (which
	  is in most situations correct).  Because the object is deleted
	  when the thread (or programs main) is left and this happens
	  before atexit is called, some leak reports are false (because,
	  e.g., all these ACE_Log_Msg's will be deleted in atexit).

	  The fix for ACE_Log_Msg consists of three changes (two only
	  relevant for Win32, one relevant for all platforms.)
	  Description of changes:

	  a) Introduced a new macro ACE_NO_HEAP_CHECK, which turns
	  off the built in heap checking until the current code block
	  is left. (defined for all platforms, but only does something
	  for Win32). This changes os.h and config-win32-common.h.

	  b) Added a static member function to ACE_Log_Msg. The function
	  (exists) returns 0 if the calling thread don't have an ACE_Log_Msg
	  and non-null if an ACE_Log_Msg exists. This changes Log_Msg.h
	  and Log_Msg.cpp.

	  c) Changed ACE_Thread_Adapter in a way that creating a new
	  thread does not automatically create an ACE_Log_Msg for the
	  calling thread. This happened until now, because the new
	  thread inherited the log settings of the calling thread.
	  This behaviour makes no sense, if the calling thread does
	  not have an ACE_Log_Msg, so i use ACE_Log_Msg::exists() (see
	  above) to prevent the implicit creation of an ACE_Log_Msg
	  for the calling thread.

	  Thanks, Matthias!

	* ace/config-win32.h and config-win32-common.h: new, consolidated
	  Win32 config files.  Thanks, again, Matthias!

	* ace/OS.h (ACE_UNUSED_ARG): determine whether we're building
	  on an Irix platform by looking for ACE_HAS_IRIX_GETTIMEOFDAY
	  instead of ACE_HAS_IRIX62_THREADS.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: VxWorks (only!) change: no longer strdups
	  program_name and local_host to avoid memory leaks.  Instead,
	  the addresses of these are copied by ACE_Log_Msg.  So, only
	  strings in the text segment should be passed to its functions!
	  Again, this change is for VxWorks only.

	* ace/Sched_Params.cpp: moved memsets of pcinfo so that entire
	  pcinfo structure is zeroed out, to _really_ avoid Purify warnings.

Fri Apr 04 12:28:40 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-mvs.h: removed ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST because MVS
	  doesn't define ip_mreq.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr
	  <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i (mutex_init): fixed the extra braces once and for all.
	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting it.

	* ace/OS.i, config-sco-5.0.0*.h: fixed for SCO so that it uses
	  single-argument gettimeofday () prototype, but calls two-arg
	  (SVR4) version in ACE_OS::gettimeofday ().  Thanks to Ganesh
	  Ganesh Pai <gpai@voicetek.com> for solving this problem.

	* ace/Log_Msg.{h,cpp}: added ACE_Log_Msg destructor.  In
	  instance (), added call to ::atexit () (::taskDeleteHookAdd ()
	  on VxWorks) to register cleanup handler.  Each new instance
	  of an ACE_Log_Msg is inserted into an ACE_Unbounded_Set; the
	  cleanup handler iterates over the Set and deletes the
	  ACE_Log_Msgs at program exit.  

	  Also, the two strings that are allocated get cleaned up after
	  the last ACE_Log_Msg instance is deleted.  Many thanks to
	  Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for figuring this out
	  and cranking out the code.

	  It works differently on VxWorks, because it doesn't have
	  ::atexit ().  VxWorks has ::taskDeleteHookAdd (), which is
	  called when each task exits.  So, the Set isn't used.  Instead,
	  the cleanup hook is called for each task when it exits, passing
	  the task control block (TCB) of the exiting task.  A pointer to
	  the ACE_Log_Msg instance is contained in one of the spare fields
	  of the TCB, so the cleanup handler simply deletes it.

	* ace/IOStream.h: specify template parameter (ACE_IOStream<STREAM>)
	  to ACE_OPERATOR{G,P}_SET macros.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr
	  <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for providing this fix.

Thu Apr  3 22:17:53 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Registry.cpp: Changed STRING_SEPARATOR from Istring to
 	  LPCTSTR.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for
 	  suggesting this.

Thu Apr  3 21:39:45 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (mutex_init): Removed errant open-brace ('{').  Thanks
 	  to Chuck Gehr (gehr@sweng.stortek.com) for the fix!

Thu Apr 03 08:52:34 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h,OS.cpp,Sched_Params.cpp: added /**/ to some #include
	  directives.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de>
	  for reporting these.

	* ace/OS.cpp (writev, readv): changed type of local variable "i"
	  from size_t to int to avoid signed/unsigned mismatch.	 Thanks
	  to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.cpp (readv), SOCK_Dgram.cpp (recv): added casts of
	  iov_len and copyn because iov_len is int on some platforms and
	  size_t on others.  This avoids compiler (MSVC 4.1) warnings.
	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for reporting
	  this.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sco5.0.0-nothread.GNU:
	  updated CCFLAGS and added LD=$(CXX).	 Thanks to
	  Ganesh Pai <gpai@voicetek.com> for these fixes.

	* ace/OS.h: added #include of <sys/regset.h> for SCO only.
	  Thanks to Ganesh Pai <gpai@voicetek.com> for this fix.

	* ace/config-sco-5.0.0*.h: added #define ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST.
	  Thanks to Ganesh Pai <gpai@voicetek.com> for this fix.

	* ace/config-{chorus,linux*,sco*}.h: removed #define of
	  ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS because it's no longer needed in the
	  config files:	 it's #defined in OS.h if needed.

Thu Apr  3 01:48:01 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Malloc.i (malloc): ACE_New_Allocator::malloc only calls new
	  if nbytes is > 0.  Purify was complaining that 0 bytes were
 	  allocated but never deleted.  Go figure.

Wed Apr  2 22:24:48 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.cpp: Moved the ACE_OS::inet_aton() method into the *.cpp
	  file and made it non-inline to work around a bug with HP/UX C++.
	  Thanks to Neil Cohen for this fix.

Wed Apr 02 10:09:37 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.1.h: added template specialization
	  with Sun C++ 4.2.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++_4.1.GNU: removed +w
	  and added comments about Sun C++ 4.2 support.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_chorus.GNU, platform_hpux_gcc.GNU,
	  platform_irix5.{2,3_g++}.GNU, platform_linux{_,pthread}.GNU,
	  platform_m88k.GNU,platform_osf1_4.0_g++.GNU,
	  platform_sco-nothread.GNU,platform_sco5.0.0-*.GNU,
	  platform_sunos{4,5}_g++.GNU, platform_sunos5_x86_g++.GNU,
	  platform_unixware_g++.GNU, platform_vxworks5.2_g++.GNU:
	  added -fno-implicit-templates to CCFLAGS.  See INSTALL file
	  for discussion of the g++ option.  Also, added -O2 because
	  it dramatically reduces object file sizes.

	* netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp: made
	  STDIN_Token::TID typedef public so that template
	  specialization (w/ Sun C++ 4.2) can access it.

Wed Apr  2 10:02:47 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Added definitions for THREAD- and PROCESS-LEVEL
 	  priorities because some implementations define these while
 	  others don't.  These are now
 	  ACE_{THR,PROC}_{FIFO,RR,OTHER}_{MIN,MAX,DEF}.  The only really
	  NEW concept is the *_DEF, which is a default value assigned by
	  ACE_OS::thr_create() if one isn't given.  Of special note is that
 	  we don't redefine a default values if it's already been
 	  defined, which allows individual programs to have their
 	  own ACE-wide "default".

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): Uses ACE_{THR,PROC}_* macros
	  rather than the PRI_* macros.

	* ace/Sched_Params.cpp (priority_min,priority_max): These now
	  use ACE_{THR,PROC}_* macros to ignore OS-specific priority
	  assignments.

	* ace/config-linux-lxpthreads.h: Removed definitions of
 	  PRI_{FIFO,RR,OTHER}_{MIN,MAX}.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_linux*.GNU (CCFLAGS): Added
 	  -fno-implicit-templates now that it's supported.  This
 	  eliminates messages of the sort 'ld: Warning size of
 	  <mangled template specialization name> change from xx to yy'
 	  when linking libACE.so.  Thanks to David Levine for making
 	  this possible!
	
Tue Apr  1 15:27:28 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/g++dep: Removed the "/bin" prefix so that this won't fail on
 	  platforms that don't have sed in /bin.  Thanks to Sandro Doro
 	  <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for this fix.

Tue Apr 01 09:55:07 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: protected definition of struct flock on VxWorks,
	  because it defines that type in sys/fcntlcom.h.  (It doesn't
	  appear to support flock (), though.)  Thanks to Dave
	  Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.h: define ACE_hrtime_t as u_longlong_t gcc, because
	  its long long types are only 4 bytes long.  Its longlong_t
	  types are 8 bytes.  Also made ACE_hrtime_t unsigned for
	  other than gcc on Unix platforms.

	* ace/OS.* (gethrtime), config-vxworks-ghs-1.8.h: added support
	  for PowerPC with Green Hills compiler.  Thanks to Dave
	  Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for providing the
	  readPPCTimeBase assembler routine.

	* ace/config-vxworks*.h: removed #include of vxWorks.h because
	  its no longer necessary with the TimeValue.h merged into OS.h.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (elapsed_time): added cast to
	  initialization of nseconds to avoid compiler warning from
	  MSVC 4.1 about narrowing from unsigned __int64.
	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for
	  reporting this.

Mon Mar 31 18:18:35 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@charlie>

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x-g++.h: 
	It was tuned to HP-UX 10.10 (and further) using g++ 2.7.2 without
	DCE/Threads.

	* ace/Task_T.cpp: 
	Another iteration on the Module.h file, this time it is not
	included *only* under HPUX and when using HP/aCC. Still IMHO
	problems will arise as template sintax checking becomes more
	popular.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h: 
	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp: 
	Replaced MAXNAMELEN with MAXPATHLEN since some platforms
	(e.g., HP/UX) have a very low value (e.g., 14 bytes) for
	MAXNAMELEN.

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x-aCC.h: 
	The comment did not make clear what was compiler/platform
	target. It also included some remarks that only applied to
	HP/C++.

	* tests/Future_Test.cpp: 
	* tests/Message_Block_Test.cpp: 
	* tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp: 
	Will not compile if ACE_HAS_THREADS was not defined and
	ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SPECIALIZATION was: they tried to
	instantiate templates that were only defined when ACE_HAS_THREADS.

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x-aCC.h: 
	More fine tuning: ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS,
	ACE_LACKS_LINEBUFFERED_STREAMBUF,
	ACE_HAS_STREAM_PIPES.

	* ace/TLI_Stream.h: 
	* ace/TLI_Acceptor.h: 
	No "Meta-type info" was defined (the PEER_ADDR and PEER_STREAM
	typedefs).

	* ace/Signal.h: 
	* ace/Signal.cpp: 
	With HP/aCC we can enable ACE_Sig_Handlers.

Mon Mar 31 22:36:55 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Service_Config.cpp (process_directives): Return -1 if
 	  ace_yyerrno > 0.  Thanks to Alan Cabrera
 	  <Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com> for reporting this.

Mon Mar 31 17:38:08 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): Moved priority determination after
 	  policy determination because it's possible for setting of the
 	  priority to fail if it's not a valid priority for the [default]
 	  policy.

Mon Mar 31 09:00:54 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* performance-tests/Misc/context_switch_time.cpp: this test no
	  longer worked.  So, reverted to revision 4.5, plus minimum
	  changes necessary to support build on platforms without threads.

	* examples/Threads/Makefile, performance-tests/Misc/Makefile:
	  moved context_switch_time.cpp from examples/Threads to
	  performance-tests/Misc.

	* examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp,
	  examples/Reactor/Misc/pingpong.cpp,
	  examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_Thr_Stream.cpp,
	  examples/Shared_Malloc/Malloc.cpp:
	  added template specializations.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU: removed dependency
	  of CCFLAGS on CFLAGS to avoid duplicate -g in build command.
	  Also, added -fno-implicit-templates in comment.

Sun Mar 30 12:52:58 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Malloc.h: The block begining with:
	  #if defined (ACE_MALLOC_STATS)
	  and ending with end of struct ACE_Malloc_Stats
	  must be moved (up) after line 107

	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for pointing
 	  this out.

	* ace/Malloc_T.cpp: The line
	  this->malloc_stats_.dump ();
	  must be changed in:
	  this->cb_ptr_->malloc_stats_.dump ();

	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for pointing
 	  this out.

	* ace/Malloc_T.cpp: the line
	  this->cb_ptr_->malloc_stats_.print ();    // print not exists
	  may be changed in:
	  this->cb_ptr_->malloc_stats_.dump ();

	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for pointing
 	  this out.

	* ace/Malloc_T.h: Added "virtual" to the ACE_New_Allocator methods
 	  to reinforce the fact that they are indeed virtual.  Thanks to
 	  Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for pointing this out.

	* ace/Malloc.h: Added "virtual" to the ACE_New_Allocator methods
 	  to reinforce the fact that they are indeed virtual.

Sat Mar 29 20:26:54 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: moved #defin of RTLD_LAZY after #include of dlfcn.h.
	  Thanks to Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for this fix.

	* ace/Task_T.h: replaced #include of "ace/Module.h" because some
	  Task_T methods use ACE_Module methods.

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking/test_{sock,spipe,tli}_{acceptor,
	  connector}.cpp,
	  examples/System_V_IPC/SV_Semaphores/Semaphores_{1,2}.cpp:
	  added template specializations.

Sat Mar 29 17:08:33 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.cpp: Added many new ACE_UNUSED_ARGS macros to eliminate
	  warnings when we are compiling without threads.

Fri Mar 28 11:34:38 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Task.{h,cpp},Thread_Manager.h: changed remaining
	  priority types to long and defaults to -1.

	* ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (spawn_i): don't clobber errno!
	  ACE_OS::thr_create () sets errno and returns -1.  So,
	  its return value should not be used to set errno.

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): fixed PTHREADS_1003_DOT_1C thread
	  priority logic.  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann
	  <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for the patch.

	* ace/config-sunos5.5*.h,README,OS.cpp (thr_create): added
	  ACE_HAS_ONLY_SCHED_OTHER to indicate that platform (Solaris 2.5)
	  only supports POSIX SCHED_OTHER scheduling policy.

	* tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp (open): added THR_SCHED_FIFO flag.
	  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for
	  for this suggestion.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Makefile,
	                            Transceiver/Makefile:
	  added -lGateway to LIBS to pick up its template
	  instantiations during links.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Peer_Router.cpp,
	                            Transceiver/transceiver.cpp,
	           Connection/blocking/SPIPE-{acceptor,connector}.cpp,
	                      misc/Connection_Handler.cpp,test_upipe.cpp,
	           Logger/simple-server/server_loggerd.cpp,
	           UPIPE_Event_Server/{Consumer,Supplier}_Router.cpp,
		   performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Options.cpp:
	  added template specializations.

Thu Mar 27 21:10:59 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/IOStream.h: only use built-in ipfx{0,1} () with __GNUC__,
	  because that's the only compiler we know of that has them.
	  Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@mat.puc.cl> for pointing this
	  out, and to James CE Johnson <jcej@lads.com> for providing the fix.

	* ace/OS.i: rearranged order of ACE_Time_Value functions (moved
	  set ()'s up, moved arithmetic operators down) so that they are
	  defined before use.

	* ace/Task_T.cpp: removed ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE around
	  #include of "ace/Module.h" so that it will build with Sun C++ 4.1.

	* apps/Gateway/Peer/Makefile: added -lGateway to LIBS to
	  pick up its template instantiations during links.

	* apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp: added template instantations.

Thu Mar 27 14:10:39 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Added two new accessors to ACE_Time_Value:

	  operator timeval *() const;
	  // Returns a pointer to the object as a timeval.

	  const operator timeval *() const;
	  // Returns a pointer to the object as a timeval.

	  Thanks to Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@mat.puc.cl> for this suggestion.

	* ace/OS.i (ACE_Time_Value): Inlined many of the ACE_Time_Value
 	  accessors.

	* ace/OS.h: Reimplemented ACE_Str_Buf at 

	  struct ACE_Export ACE_Str_Buf : public strbuf
	  {
	    // = Initialization method
	    ACE_Str_Buf(void* b = 0, int l = 0, int max = 0);
	    // Constructor.
	  };
 
          this makes the casting from ACE_Str_Buf* to strbuf* a "safe"
 	  cast and makes it more portable (say on platforms where the
 	  fields in strbuf are not in the right order).  Thanks to Carlos
 	  O'Ryan <coryan@mat.puc.cl> for this fix.

	* ace/OS.h: Moved the definition of imr_multiaddr to just before
 	  class ACE_OS so that it picks everything up appropriately.
  	  Thanks to Hakan Kallberg <hk@simulina.se> for reporting this.

	* ace/config-aix-4.[12].x.h and config-mvs.h: Fixed the
 	  ACE_HAS_MULTICAST macros, which should have said
 	  ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST.  Thanks to Daniel Montalibet
 	  <daniel_montalibet@stortek.com> for reporting this.

Thu Mar 27 15:54:10 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/{Thread,Thread_Manager}.{h,i,cpp} (ACE_Thread): Changed
	  type for priority arg to spawn*() from u_int to long to
	  support changes in thr_create indicated below.  Thanks to
	  Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for these
	  changes.

	* ace/OS.cpp: Ensure that whenever either a priority of a
	  scheduling policy is set explicitly, with POSIX threads, the
	  other argument and the flag THR_EXPLICIT_SCHED is set
	  automatically.  A range check for priority values for POSIX
	  1003.1c is also included.  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann
	  <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for these changes.

	* ace/OS.h: Changed type and default value of priority arg to 
	  thr_create from u_int to long and 0 to -1.  Thanks to Thilo 
	  Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for these
	  changes.  Also added ACE_MAX and ACE_MIN macros.

Thu Mar 27 11:25:38 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* netsvcs/servers/Makefile: removed SHOBJ so that main.so is not
	  built, because it wasn't needed.  Thanks to Sandro Doro
	  <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for this fix.

	* ace/config-aix-4.[12].x.h,config-mvs.h: changed
	  ACE_HAS_MULTICAST to ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST.  Thanks to Daniel
	  Montalibet <daniel_montalibet@stortek.com> for reporting
	  this. 

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU,
	                      platform_sunos5_x86_g++.GNU,
	                      platform_unixware_g++.GNU:
	  removed "-L$(WRAPPER_ROOT)/ace -L./" from LDFLAGS because it
	  is added to LDFLAGS in include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/{Event_Channel.cpp,Gateway.cpp,
	                        Proxy_Handler.cpp,Proxy_Handler_Acceptor.cpp,
	                        Proxy_Handler_Connector.cpp,
	  examples/IPC_SAP/UPIPE_SAP/ex{2,3}.cpp,
	  netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Client_Test.cpp,
	  netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:
	  added template specializations.

Thu Mar 27 10:05:59 1997  Prashant Jain  <pjain@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* netsvcs/lib/TS_Clerk_Handler.cpp: Fixed two things:
	  1) In TS_Clerk_Processor::parse_args() changed
	  "%n:\n[-p hostname:port] [-t timeout] [-p poolname]\n%a", 1),
	  to
	  "%n:\n[-h hostname:port] [-t timeout] [-p poolname]\n%a", 1),

	  2) In TS_Clerk_Processor::alloc() changed
	  void *temp = 0;
          // Only create the state if it doesn't already exist.
          if (this->shmem_->find (ACE_DEFAULT_TIME_SERVER_STR, temp) ==  -1)
          {
            // Allocate the space out of shared memory for the system time entry
            temp = this->shmem_->malloc (sizeof (this->system_time_));
 
          to:
 
          // Only create the state if it doesn't already exist.
          if (this->shmem_->find (ACE_DEFAULT_TIME_SERVER_STR) ==  -1)
          {
            // Allocate the space out of shared memory for the system time entry
            void *temp = this->shmem_->malloc (sizeof (this->system_time_));
 
          Thanks to Sandro Doro (alex@aureus.sublink.org) for suggesting these changes.

Thu Mar 27 01:00:18 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_irix6.2_sgiCC.GNU: Added a new
 	  platform config file for SGI Irix 6.2 using the CC compiler (not
 	  NCC nor the MipsProcompiler).  Thanks to Eric Dean Russell
 	  <edrusse@somnet.sandia.gov> for these changes.

	* ace/OS.h: Moved the ACE_LACKS_UTSNAME_T block into the right
 	  part of the code.  Thanks to Jonathan Biggar <jon@sems.com> for
 	  this fix.

	* ace/Malloc.h: Added an enhancement so that the new alignment
 	  features will work regardless of the size of ACE_MALLOC_ALIGN.
  	  Thanks to Fred LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for this fix.

	* ace/Synch_Options.cpp: We now automatically set the USE_TIMEOUT
 	  flag if a non-0 timeout value is supplied.  Thanks to Tim
 	  Liddelow <tim@cst.com.au> for this suggestion.

Wed Mar 26 08:47:24 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/{ACE.cpp,Log_Msg.cppOS.cpp},
	  tests/{Message_Queue_Test.cpp,Naming_Test.cpp}:
	  Changed ::sprintf calls to ACE_OS::sprintf.  Thanks to
	  Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for
	  reporting this.

	* netsvcs/lib/{Client_Logging_Handler.cpp,Name_Handler.cpp,
	               Server_Logging_Handler.cpp,TS_Service_Handler.cpp,
	               Token_Handler.cpp}: added template specializations.

Tue Mar 25 06:47:14 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Moved config.h to the top of OS.h so that we don't
 	  have to worry about not defining things in the right place.
  	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing
 	  this out.

Tue Mar 25 22:54:49 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Added UNICODE support for ACE_OS::chdir().  Thanks to
	  Ivan Murphy <Ivan.Murphy@med.siemens.de> for the code.

Tue Mar 25 21:26:10 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/TTY_IO.{h,cpp},README, and these config files:
	  config-aix-*.h, config-hpux-*.h, config-irix5.*.h,
	  config-mvs.h, config-osf1-*.h, config-sun*.h (except for g++
	  and config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.1.h), config-win*.h:
	  Added ACE_NEEDS_DEV_IO_CONVERSION to conditionally compile the
	  ACE_DEV_IO & conversion operator for ACE_TTY_IO, which is a
	  subclass of ACE_DEV_IO.  Thanks to Fred LaBar
	  <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> and Gonzalo Diethelm
	  <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for reporting warnings without this on
	  Irix 6.2 with the mipsPro compiler.

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): on VxWorks, always pass 0 as first arg to
	  ::taskSpawn () so that VxWorks will generate the task ID.
	  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com>
	  for providing this fix, without which random task names would
	  be assigned.

	* ace/ACE.cpp (get_bcast_addr): added return 0 at end of non-WIN32
	  code to avoid compile warning from g++.

	* tests/IOStream_Test.cpp: removed extra "(%P|%t)" from output.
	  I couldn't get ACE_ERROR_RETURN to work on g++:  it complained
	  about mismatched return types when returning an int from a
	  function that returns a void *, and about mismatched arguments
	  to an ACE_Log_Msg function if I cast the int to a void *.  So,
	  I used ACE_ERROR instead.
	  Added ACE_UNUNSED_ARG (arg).	Removed unused variables
	  error_at_server and error_at_client.

	* netsvcs/lib/TS_Clerk_Handler.cpp: added another template
	  specialization.

	* examples/Reactor/Multicast/client.cpp: Log_Wrapper::LOG_DEBUG
	  instead of LM_DEBUG.

	* examples/Threads/context_switch_time.cpp: use ACE_Sched_Params
	  to get platform-dependent thread priorities.	Also, moved #includes
	  so that config.h is read before testing for ACE_HAS_THREADS.

	* examples/Threads/{auto_event.cpp,barrier2.cpp,future1.cpp,
			    future2.cpp,reader_writer.cpp,tss1.cpp,tss2.cpp}:
	  added template specializations.

Tue Mar 25 10:01:05 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* config-linux.h: Added
 	ACE_HAS_{SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING,AUTOMATIC_INIT_FINI}.  Thanks to
 	alex@aureus.sublink.org (Sandro Doro) for the change.

	* platform_linux.GNU: Added -ldl to LIBS.  Thanks to
 	alex@aureus.sublink.org (Sandro Doro) for the change.

Tue Mar 25 16:01:34 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@charlie>

	* ace/Svc_Handler.cpp: 
	I forgot to comment this: "operator delete" used to call ::delete
	on a void*, on ANSI/C++ this is not allowed. Since "operator new"
	calls ::new for a char[] I do a casting to char* and call
	::delete[] on the char pointer.

	* ace/config-hpux-10.x-aCC.h: 
	HP-UX 10.10 supports CLOCK_GETTIME, my guess is that it should
	work with g++ and HP/C++, but I won't mess with those files yet.

	* ace/Connector.h: 
	The default address parameter for "connect" is a bit tricky, from
	the comments in the file:
	  //
	  // If the compiler supports 'typename' we cannot use
	  // 
	  // PEER_CONNECTOR::PEER_ADDR::sap_any
	  // 
	  // because PEER_CONNECTOR::PEER_ADDR is not considered a
	  // type. But: 
	  //
	  // typename PEER_CONNECTOR::PEER_ADDR::sap_any
	  // 
	  // will not work either, because now we are declaring sap_any a
	  // type, further:
	  // 
	  // (typename PEER_CONNECTOR::PEER_ADDR)::sap_any
	  //
	  // is considered a casting expression. All I can think of is
	  // using a typedef, I tried PEER_ADDR but that was a source of
	  // trouble on some platforms. I will try:
	  //
	  typedef ACE_PEER_CONNECTOR_ADDR ACE_PEER_ADDR_TYPEDEF;

	* ace/OS.h: 
	The stock HP C++ compiler (cfront based) gives lots of warnings in
	<net/if.h>. I used to define volatile to avoid this warnings. Now
	I think I'll rather like to see them.

	* ace/SPIPE_Stream.h: 
	* ace/SPIPE_Connector.h: 
	There was no meta-type info (PEER_ADDR) for SPIPE_Stream and
	SPIPE_Connector.

	* ace/Stream_Modules.h: 
	* ace/Stream_Modules.cpp: 
	Fixed a "bug" introduced in my last change: a couple of
	ACE_ALLOC_HOOK_* were commented but shouldn't.

	* examples/Connection/non-blocking/CPP-acceptor.cpp (open): 
	PR_AD cannot be used in this context, it expands to
	_ACE_PEER_ACCEPTOR::PEER_ADDR (via ACE_PEER_ACCEPTOR_ADDR), but
	the template parameter is _ACE_PEER_STREAM (aka PR_ST_1, aka
	ACE_PEER_STREAM_1).
	The right macro was ACE_PEER_STREAM_ADDR.

	* ace/Connector.h: 
	* ace/Connector.cpp: 
	The typedef trick I used (PEER_ADDR) did not work on every
	platform.
	I also broke some examples since ACE_PEER_CONNECTOR_ADDR did not
	include ACE_TYPENAME on its definition. Hopefully this new trick
	will work everywhere.

	* I finally sorted out the mistery of including "ace/Module.h"
	into "ace/Task_T.cpp": when compiling "ace/Stream_Modules.cpp" you
	get the following include sequence:
	Stream_Modules.cpp
	  Stream_Modules.h
	    Task.h
	      Task.i
	      Task_T.h
	        Message_Queue.h (descendants removed)
		Synch_T.h (descendants removed)
		Task.h (already included).
		Task_T.i
		Task_T.cpp
		  Module.h
		    ACE.h (descendants removed)
		    Task.h (already included).
		    Module.i
		    Module.cpp

	At this point Module.cpp uses ACE_Thru_Task declared on
	Stream_Modules.h, but after the #include "ace/Task.h";
	in fact Module.cpp tries to #include "ace/Stream_Modules.cpp" but
	that second #include expands to nothing due to the canonical
	protection on Stream_Modules.h.
	That explains the removal of Module.h in Task_T.cpp.
	If you are wondering why so long an explanation for this change
	the answer is simple: just because I was curious on now it worked.

Mon Mar 24 14:08:48 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast): Cleaned up the code a
 	  bit.

	* ace/ACE: Added a new method called get_bcast_addr() which will
 	  get the broadcast address for a host.  Thanks to Paul Han
 	  <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for suggesting this.

	* ace/UNIX_Addr: Added another set method in UNIX_Addr class:

	  void set (const ACE_UNIX_Addr &sa);
	  // Creates an ACE_UNIX_Addr from another <ACE_UNIX_Addr>.

	  Thanks to Paul Han <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for this.
	  
	* ace/SOCK_Dgram: Removed the #if defined (ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST) 
	  since this is now handled at the ACE_OS level.

	* ace/OS.h: Added support for IP multicast macros and structs even
 	  on platforms that don't support it so that the tests will
 	  compile without having lots of #ifdefs.

	* tests/Future_Test.cpp: Added a check for platforms that lack
 	  threads.  Thanks to Hakan Kallberg <hk@simulina.se>
	  for reporting this.

	* netsvcs/lib/Server_Logging_Handler.cpp: Added a check for
	  platforms that lack threads.  Thanks to Hakan Kallberg
	  <hk@simulina.se> for reporting this.

	* examples/Threads/context_switch_time.cpp: Added an #ifdef for
 	  ACE_HAS_THREADS to this test so that it will compile on
 	  platforms that don't have threading.  Thanks to Scott Halstead
 	  <scott.halstead@gs.com> for reporting this.

	* tests/IOStream_Test.cpp: Fixed up this test so that it works
 	  correctly on platforms that lack multi-threading.  Thanks to
 	  Scott Halstead <scott.halstead@gs.com> for reporting this.

	* netsvcs/lib/Makefile: Reincluded the LIB target so that we'll
 	  build a static library.  Thanks to Scott Halstead
 	  <scott.halstead@gs.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp (recv): Added a check to make sure that we
 	  don't try to copy more into the recv buffer than we've really
 	  got.  Thanks to Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com for this fix.

	* ace/OS.cpp (readv): Added a check to make sure that we don't try
 	  to copy more into the recv buffer than we've really got.  Thanks
 	  to Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com for this fix.

	* ace/Malloc.h: Modified the alignment strategy to define
 	  ACE_MALLOC_ALIGN to a number of bytes. (it gets rounded to a
 	  number of long's).  This makes it easier to work with more
 	  complex buffer alignment strategies (e.g., DMA).  Thanks to Fred
 	  LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for this.

	* ace/OS.cpp (readv): Added several more changes for the readv()
 	  emulation.  Thanks to Alan Cabrera <Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com>
 	  and Adam Porter <aporter@cs.umd.edu> for these fixes.

Mon Mar 24 14:22:17 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): For VxWorks, fixed call to ::taskSpawn ().
	  ACE's arguments are in an array, not individual arguments.
	  Also, set flags to VX_FP_TASK if it's 0, to match behavior
	  of ::sp ().  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer
	  <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for reporting these and providing
	  the fix.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (elapsed_time (struct timespec &):
	  fixed, using same approach as in elapsed_time
	  (ACE_hrtime_t &nanoseconds), to get nanosecond resolution.

	* netsvcs/lib/TS_Clerk_Handler.cpp (handle_close): added
	  ACE_UNUSED_ARG (mask).  Also, added template specializations.

	* examples/Reactor/Multicast/server.cpp (Server_Events ctor):
	  rearranged initializers to match declaration order.

	* examples/IOStream/server/iostream_server.cpp,
	                    client/iostream_client.cpp:
	  added template specializations.

Mon Mar 24 13:21:31 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (elapsed_time): Added an
	  ACE_High_Res_Timer::elapsed_time (ACE_hrtime_t &nanosecond)
	  method that returns the number of elapsed nanoseconds.  This is
	  accomplished even with the scale factors converting to
	  microseconds.  It also does not use floating point
	  calculations.

Sun Mar 23 13:25:39 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.h: Removed <scale_factor> from the
	  constructor of High_Res_Timer.  All High_Res_Timers now use
	  global_scale_factor_ directly.  Hopefully, this will not break
	  any existing code!

Sat Mar 22 12:06:22 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: The include statement for config.h was too low.  Some
 	  defines for key_t, needed for NT, didn't work.  Thanks to Alan
 	  Cabrera <Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com> for these fixes.

	* examples/Reactor/Multicast: Improved the multicast client and
 	  server programs to work better.

	* ace/Connector.cpp: Modified the ACE_Connector::handle_close()
 	  method to prevent recursive calls to itself.  Thanks to Paul Han
 	  <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for reporting this.

	* ace/Svc_Handler.cpp: Put the check (closing_ == 0) in the
 	  destructor as well as in the destroy() method.  This prevents a
 	  possible core dump when the timer exists.  The instruction
 	  reactor::remove_handler in the shutdown method currently will be
 	  called twice when ACE_Svc_Handler object is being deleted.  Core
 	  dump occurs when it tries to execute ACE_Reactor::remove_handler
 	  method the second time because the ACE_Svc_Handler object
 	  pointer has already been deleted by the previous instruction
 	  ACE_Reactor::cancel_timer.  Thanks to Paul Han
 	  <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.cpp: Added new thread-safe implementations of writev()
 	  and readv() for platforms that lack these functions.

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp: Added new implementations of
 	  ACE_SOCK_Dgram::{send,recv} that define methods for
 	  send(iovec[], ...)  and recv(iovec[], ...) for systems that
 	  don't have sendmsg() and recvmsg().  Thanks to Alan Cabrera
 	  <Alan_Cabrera@fp.cibc.com> for these fixes.

	* apps/jaws/HTTP_Handler.cpp: Removed some problematic template
 	  specializations that were left over from an earlier version of
 	  JAWS.  Thanks to Adam Porter <aporter@cs.umd.edu> for reporting
 	  this.

	* examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp: Revised the
 	  code to use the new ACE_Svc_Handler logic that checks to ensure
 	  that we don't recurse infinitely in handle_close().
	  Thanks to Jean-Marc Strauss <strauss@club-internet.fr> for
	  reporting this problem.

	* examples/Logger/simple-server/Logging_Handler.cpp
 	  (handle_close): Added a check to make sure we don't end up
 	  recursively calling handle_close().  This will prevent
	  a segfault.

Sat Mar 22 07:30:49 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.*: Changed scale factor to convert
	  platform-dependent clock units to microseconds instead of
	  nanoseconds.  That way, it should be greater than 1 for
	  all supported platforms.  So, it's now an unsigned long
	  instead of a double.

	* ace/OS.h: Changed ACE_hrtime_t to unsigned __int64 with
	  _MSC_VER.  Also, fixed typo: "uint64" instead of "unit64"
	  without _MSC_VER.

Fri Mar 21 08:37:34 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@charlie>

	* makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
	I use the macro SOEXT to support HP non-standard extension for
	shared library names (.sl instead of .so).
	I also changed the rule to build shared libraries: under HP-UX you
	cannot pass extra libraries (-lXXX options) when building a shared
	lib. Before HP-UX 10.10 it wasn't a problem because no library was
	needed with ACE, but to support XLI the '-lxti' flag must be used
	on binaries (but not on shared libs).

	* include/makeinclude/platform_hpux.GNU: 
	The PIC option (+Z) was used always, clearly not intended.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU: 
	Added a config file for g++ under HP-UX.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: 
	Added a config file for HP/aCC compiler under HP-UX.

	* ace/Makefile: 
	* netsvcs/lib/Makefile: 
	Changed to support the SOEXT macro.

	* config-hpux-10.x.h: 
	* config-hpux-10.x-aCC.h: 
	* config-hpux-10.x-g++.h: 
	I updated the files to HP-UX 10.10, AFAIK since that version HP-UX
	uses fd_set instead of int in select(2) (so ACE_SELECT_USES_INT is
	not needed) and the OS supports siginfo_t and ucontext_t so
	ACE_HAS_SIGINFO_T and ACE_HAS_UCONTEXT_T are defined.
	I *do not* have threads at my site nor the infamous PHSS_6246
	patch so I couldn't test the threaded version nor the HP cfront
	based one.
	ACE compiled fine with g++ and HP/aCC though.

	* ace/OS.h: 
	* ace/Malloc_T.h: 
	HP/aCC supports the typename keyword. I added a new config macro
	'ACE_HAS_TYPENAME_KEYWORD', when it is defined ACE_TYPENAME
	expands to 'typename' when not it expands to nothing.
	On the cases where HP/aCC requires the usage of 'typename' I added
	a 'ACE_TYPENAME'.

	* ace/OS.i: 
	* ace/OS.cpp: 
	ACE_OS::inet_aton cannot be inlined under HP-UX.

	* ace/Connector.h: 
	* ace/Connector.cpp: 
	I have decided to use a typedef (PEER_ADDR) instead of
	ACE_PEER_CONNECTOR_ADDR, mainly because the second form
	requires a ACE_TYPENAME before each usage.

	* ace/Event_Handler_T.i: 
	Much to my surprize ACE_TYPENAME is required when using a template
	typedef as a return value.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h: 
	HP/aCC does not like the usage of a private typedef from another
	class.

	* ace/Strategies_T.h: 
	* ace/Strategies_T.cpp: 
	ACE_Process_Strategy declared two defaults constructors:
	ACE_Process_Strategy(void) and ACE_Process_Strategy(int = 1).
	The constructor code was wrong, it called open() with parameters:
	open(thr_mgr, thr_flags, n_threads)
	none of which were defined, worse, open() receives just one
	parameter (the number of processes) just as the constructor, I
	believe that C-w programming is lurking here.

	* ace/Signal.cpp: 
	Though the header file does not declare ACE_Sig_Handlers under
	HP-UX (and the code is not defined too) some auxiliary functions
	that use ACE_Sig_Handlers were defined. I removed their
	definition.
	Some day I'll try to take a look at the code, trying to find out
	was wrong with them.

	* ace/Stream_Modules.h: 
	* ace/Stream_Modules.cpp: 
	By mistake I commented out the ACE_ALLOC_HOOK_* macros; have to
	fix it *real soon*.

	* ace/Task_T.cpp: 
	No need to include "ace/Module.h" since only the template
	declaration is used. When ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE is defined
	you end up using ACE_Thru_Task before it gets defined.
	This is no problem unless your compiler checks template	sintax
	before instantiation as the HP/aCC compiler do.

	* examples/Reactor/Misc/test_demuxing.cpp: 
	ACE_MT_SYNCH was used, but it is only defined if ACE_HAS_THREADS,
	I used ACE_SYNCH instead, which is defined as ACE_MT_SYNCH if
	ACE_HAS_THREADS and as ACE_NULL_SYNCH if not.
	Maybe the semantics are wrong, but the thing compiles.

Fri Mar 21 15:10:59 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Makefile (FILES): Moved Log_Msg to the beginning of the
 	  source list in the ace Makefile.  This is nice because it forces
 	  the compilation of OS.i and that, obviously, is where you get
 	  the complaints for the port.  It's nice to have it at the
 	  beginning so you catch the errors very early on before you've
 	  compiled 30 or 40 files.  Thanks to Scott Halstead
 	  <scott.halstead@gs.com> for this suggestion.

	* ace/Memory_Pool.cpp: Added #if !defined
	  (ACE_LACKS_SYSV_SHMEM) to handle systems like Chorus that
	  lack this feature.  

Thu Mar 20 18:58:50 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Svc_Handler.cpp (destroy): Added a state variable to keep
 	  track of when we are closing down the Svc_Handler.  This is
 	  necessary to prevent endless recursive calls to handle_close()
 	  due to the recent enhancements to ACE_Timer_{List,Heap}.  Thanks
 	  to Bert Craytor <Bert_Craytor@peoplesoft.com> for reporting
 	  this.

	* tests/Conn_Test.cpp: Added a new test that makes sure the
 	  Acceptor, Connector, and Svc_Handler are working correctly.

	* ace: Added some more changes for Chorus.  Thanks to Wei Chiang
 	  <chiang@tele.nokia.fi> for these changes.

	* ace/OS.h: Added #define for SIGSEGV for platforms that lack it
 	  (e.g., Chorus).

	* ace: Made a bunch of minor changes to support SunOS 4.x better.
	  Thanks to Scott Halstead <scott.halstead@gs.com> for reporting
	  these problems.

	* tests/Conn_Test.cpp: Added ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SPECIALIZATION
 	  for the various templates used in this test.  Thanks to Thilo
 	  Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for reporting this.

	* ace/Connector.cpp (connector): Fixed some minor bugs that
 	  prevented the ACE_Connector from compiling.  Thanks to David
 	  Levine for noticing this.

	* ace/OS.h: Moved the ACE_LACKS_SIGACTION block so that it will
 	  work on Win32.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
 	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing this out.

Thu Mar 20 22:38:27 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_Heap.cpp: added template specializations.

	* netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp,
	              Name_Handler.cpp
	              Server_Logging_Handler.cpp
	              TS_Clerk_Handler.cpp
	              TS_Server_Handler.cpp
	              Token_Handler.cpp: added template specializations.
	  There are still many missing from libnetsvcs.

	* tests/Conn_Test.cpp,
	        Future_Test.cpp
	        IOStream_Test.cpp
	        Map_Manager_Test.cpp
	        Message_Block_Test.cpp
	        Message_Queue_Test.cpp
	        Reader_Writer_Test.cpp
	        SV_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp
	        Thread_Pool_Test.cpp}: added template specializations.
	  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
	  for providing these.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: removed commented-out template specialization.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_{chorus,hpux,hpux_gcc}.GNU:
	  split out CFLAGS and CCFLAGS from CC and CXX.

	* ace/config-aix-4.[12].x.h: added back ACE_HAS_THREAD_SELF and
	  and ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING; removed ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_T.
	  Thanks to Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for figuring these out.

Thu Mar 20 12:25:30 1997    <harrison@samba.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace.{mak,mdp}: Build->Settings->Code Generation->Processor is
	  now set to "Pentium" instead of "Blend*" for Debug and Release
 	  builds.

	* ace/config-win32-msvc4.x.h:
	* ace/config-win32-msvc2.0.h:
	* ace/config-winnt-4.0-msvc4.x.h: Only define ACE_HAS_PENTIUM when
	  _M_IX86 == 500.  Projects must specify Pentium in
	  Build->Settings->Code Generation->Processor to use the RDTSC
	  instruction in ACE_OS::gethrtime.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.{cpp,i}: By default, High_Res_Timer is
	  constructed with a scale_factor == 1.  This allowed me to remove
	  all the checks for scale_factor == 0 in the code.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.h (static gettimeofday): If
	  global_scale_factor_ is not set, and we're on a platform that
 	  requires global_scale_factor_ (e.g., Win32),
 	  ACE_OS::gettimeofday will be used instead of ACE_OS::gethrtime.
  	  This allows the scale_factor of 1 to still result in correct
 	  values.

Wed Mar 19 15:02:09 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace: Added zillions of minor changes so that ACE will compile on
 	  the new aCC compiler for HPUX.  Thanks to Gonzalo A. Diethelm
 	  <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> and Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@mat.puc.cl> for
	  help with this.

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp (subscribe): In addition to the
 	  SO_REUSEADDR option, Irix has a SO_REUSEPORT option that must
 	  also be set to allow multiple sockets to bind to the same
 	  multicast address.  Thanks to Robert V. Head <rhead@vtcs20a> for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace: Added a slew of changes to support CHORUS.  Thanks to
	  Wei Chiang <chiang@tele.nokia.fi> for these changes.

	* ace/config-sunos4.*.h: Added #define ACE_HAS_UNION_WAIT based
	  on the recommendation of Kumar Neelakantan
	  <kneelaka@painewebber.com>.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log_hexdump): Replaced the use of ::sprintf()
	  with ACE_OS::sprintf() so that the return value would be correct
	  on SunOS 4.x!

	* ace/OS: Added ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SPRINTF and ACE_SPRINTF_ADAPTER
 	  to ACE_OS::sprintf() for SunOS 4.x platforms.  Thanks to Kumar
 	  Neelakantan <kneelaka@painewebber.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/Handle_Set.cpp (ACE_Handle_Set_Iterator): If the bound was
 	  reached in the following loop, we should set this->num_ =
 	  this->handles_.max_handle_ + 1 rather than go into the 2nd loop.
  	  Thanks to Michael Newton <michaeln@in.ot.com.au> for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Handle_Set.cpp (ACE_Handle_Set_Iterator):
 	  ACE_Handle_Set_Iterator::ACE_Handle_Set_Iterator did not work
 	  properly if called with a zero handleset, as there was no bounds
 	  check on the first loop therein.  Thanks to Michael Newton
 	  <michaeln@in.ot.com.au> for reporting this.

Wed Mar 19 16:06:32 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h,README: added ACE_HAS_AIX_BROKEN_SOCKET_HEADER to wrap
	  #include of sys/socket.h with #undef/#define of __cplusplus.

	* ace/config-aix-4.[12].x.h: added ACE_HAS_AIX_BROKEN_SOCKET_HEADER,
	  ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_T, ACE_LACKS_TCP_H, and ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED.
	  Removed ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING and ACE_HAS_THREAD_SELF.

	Thanks to Daniel Montalibet <daniel_montalibet@stortek.com> for
	both of the above modifications.

	* platform_{dgux4_epc,irix5.3_g++,linux*,m88k,osf1_3.2,sco*,
	  sunos4_g++,sunos5_centerline*,sunos5_g++,sunos5_sunc++*,
	  unixware_g++,vxworks5.2_g++}.GNU: split out CFLAGS and CCFLAGS.
	  Also, removed -lstdc++/-lm from g++ versions, because we now set
	  CXX to g++ instead of gcc, so those libraries are picked up.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0{,_g++}.GNU:
	  added -lrt to support ACE_Sched_Params.  Thanks to
	  Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for
	  suggesting this.  Also, split out CFLAGS and CCFLAGS.

	* ace/OS.h: removed SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING protection around
	  #define of RTLD_LAZY because it's used in ace/Parse_Node.cpp.
	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing
	  this out.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_setcanceltype): added ACE_UNUSED_ARGS for STHREADS
	  case.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for
	  providing this fix.

Tue Mar 18 21:53:03 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast): Modified the
 	  SOCK_Dgram_Bcast class by adding a const char *host_name to the
 	  contructor, and open, and mk_broadcast methods.  If the user
 	  passes in the host_name, then only the broadcast address of an
 	  interface that has a matching ip address with the host will be
 	  added to the if_list_.  Otherwise, nothing changes.  Thanks to
 	  Paul <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for this feature.

Tue Mar 18 13:20:59 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ace.mdp: Reverted the change for DllMain as the entry point
 	  to ace.dll.  This is causing problems in multi-threaded
	  applications. 

	* netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp: Added a check in fini()
 	  to make sure we have a valid handler.  If the connect attempt
 	  failed, this->handler_ will be set to 0.

	* tests/Mem_Map_Test.cpp: Added code that removes all temporary
 	  files created by the test.

	* tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp: Made sure we remove the backing
 	  store file left behind by a aborted clerk process.

	* examples/Reactor/Ntalker/ntalker.cpp: The ntalker now uses
 	  ACE::register_stdin_handler to register the STDIN. This function
 	  allows for portability.

Tue Mar 18 08:12:22 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp,Makefile: replaced "y.tab.c" string with
	  "Svc_Conf_y.cpp" to ease debugging.  Thanks to Luca Priorelli
	  <lucapri@mbox.vol.it> for suggesting this.

	* ace/IOStream.cpp (close): replaced call to
	  ACE_SOCK_Stream::close () with one to generic STREAM::close ().
	  Thanks to Kumar Neelakantan <kneelaka@painewebber.com> for
	  reporting this problem.

	* ace/OS.h,README,config-*.h: removed ACE_HAS_RTLD_LAZY_V, and
	  replaced with #define of RTLD_LAZY macro only if it's not
	  already defined (and if ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING is defined).
	  Thanks to Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for providing this fix.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_setcancelstate, thr_setcanceltype, thr_cancel):
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG calls to avoid compiler warnings.  Thanks
	  to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for suggesting them.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h: moved #include of Local_Name_Space.h up
	  because this file needs declaration of ACE_NS_String.	 There
	  _shouldn't_ be a circular include problem because the #includes are
	  protected.  Thanks to Daniel Montalibet
	  <daniel_montalibet@stortek.com> for reporting this problem and
	  providing the fix.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space.h: removed #include of ace/Service_Config.h.

	* include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: put -I. before
	  -I$(WRAPPER_ROOT) instead of after.

	* tests/IOStream_test.cpp: added checks for receipt of proper values.

Tue Mar 18 01:38:14 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ace.mdp: Add DllMain as the entry point of ace.dll.  This
	  allows us to call WSAStartup when ace.dll is loaded in and
	  WSACleanup when ace.dll is unloaded.  People using ace as a
	  static library are still out in the cold with respect of getting
	  WSACleanup called before the process exits. 
 	
	  I am not sure of two cases: (1) What happens when an application
 	  crashes and was not able to call WSACleanup and (2) if the
	  application wants to continue using sockets when ace.dll is
	  unloaded.  I hope this solves more problems than it creates ;-)

Tue Mar 18 01:38:14 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Parse_Node.cpp: Added END_OF_LINE characters to some
 	  ACE_ERRORs.

	* netsvcs/{lib,servers}: Fixed the project files to produce and
	  use the dll in the correct place (which is netsvcs/lib).

	* ace/Log_Record.cpp: Corrected format string for fprintf().

	* examples/Threads/test.mdp: Added context_switch_time.cpp to the
	  project.

	  All of the above bugs were reported by Luca Priorelli
	  <lucapri@mbox.vol.it>.  Thanks for the contribution.

Mon Mar 17 12:59:56 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.{h,i}: added nanosleep (), currently supported only
	  on POSIX platforms (if ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME is defined).

	* examples/Mem_Map/IO-tests/{IO_Test.cpp,test_io.cpp):
	  LM_ERROR instead of ACE_ERROR, and fixed call to ACE::basename ().

	* ace/OS.cpp (sched_params): return -1 if not supported,
	  instead of ENOTSUP.

	* ace/OS.cpp (fork): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (program_name) for WIN32
	  and VxWorks.

	* ace/Sched_Params.cpp (priority_min, priority_max, next_priority,
	  previous_priority): not supported on MVS, via ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED.
	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for figuring this
	  out and providing the fix.

	* tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp (test_performance): changed type of
	  local variable "i" to (signed) int to avoid signed/unsigned
	  comparison, and eventual seg fault because a loop would never
	  terminate.

Sun Mar 16 11:31:46 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_{List,Queue,Heap}.h: Defined copy constructors and
 	  assignment operators in the private part of the class so that
 	  users won't accidentally make mistakes.

Sat Mar 15 21:44:45 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_{Queue,List}.cpp (cancel): handle_close() should be
 	  called only once (especially when handle_close() implements
 	  "delete this;" ).  Since it is possible that the EH will be
 	  registered more than once, I changed the code to do the
 	  following:

          if (number_of_cancellations == 1)
	    // Call the close hook.
            curr->handler_->handle_close (ACE_INVALID_HANDLE, 
                                          ACE_Event_Handler::TIMER_MASK);

          Thanks to Hamutal Yanay <Hamutal_Yanay@mail.icomverse.com> for
 	  suggesting this.

	* examples/Mem_Map/IO-tests/test_io.cpp (run_tests): Removed all
 	  uses of ::perror and replaced them with calls to ACE_ERROR
 	  macros.

	* ace/Mem_Map.i (unmap): The ACE_Mem_Map::close method does not
	  work properly if the value of file_mapping_ is equal to
	  ACE_INVALID_HANDLE.  In this case the method calls a useless
	  close (-1).  Therefore, I changed:

	  if (this->file_mapping_ != this->handle_)
	    ACE_OS::close (this->file_mapping_);
 
          in:
 
          if (this->file_mapping_ != this->handle_ &&
	      this->file_mapping_ != ACE_INVALID_HANDLE)
	    ACE_OS::close (this->file_mapping_);

	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting
 	  this.

Thu Mar 13 18:21:15 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ReactorEx.h: Change protection of methods/variables of
	  ReactorEx from private to protected. Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for suggesting this.

Thu Mar 13 16:31:54 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (thr_getprio): Added missing ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN
	  for the case of pthreads && !defined (ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED).
	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for
	  reporting this.

Thu Mar 13 00:12:15 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp (dump): Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG around
 	  fake_this to stop the compiler from complaining about unused
 	  variables.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Data_Block::size): Moved the copying
 	  of the old base before freeing it up. Thanks to Dieter Quehl
	  (dietrich.quehl@med.siemens.de) for pointing this out.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp: Added code to the list methods such
 	  that structured exceptions are handled correctly.  Thanks to
 	  Karlheinz Dorn (karlheinz.dorn@med.siemens.de) for reporting
 	  this.

Wed Mar 12 21:31:51 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/Reactor/Ntalker/ntalker.cpp: Made changes to the
	  program which allows it to run under Win32. 

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp: Made changes to the setting of the
 	  interface address so that it works correctly under Win32. 
	  Thanks to Todd L. Montgomery (tmont@cs.wvu.edu), Anton van
 	  Straaten (anton@appsolutions.com), Ole O. Johnsen
	  (Ole.Johnsen@gpi.telemax.no), Mike Flinn
	  (mike.flinn@smtpgate.aws.waii.com), Steve Weismuller
 	  (spweismu@rsoc.rockwell.com) and others who helped out.

Wed Mar 12 17:05:52 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-linux-lxpthreads.h: Added ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST.

Wed Mar 12 16:07:07 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (gethrtime): Added support for VxWorks and
	  other platforms that support ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME.

Tue Mar 11 21:38:42 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (open): Improved support for passing flags through to
	  CreateFile ().

Tue Mar 11 14:30:12 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-vxworks-ghs-1.8.h: added ACE_LACKS_SYS_NERR.
	  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for
	  reporting this.

	* ace/OS.{i,cpp} (uname, hostname): added VxWorks support.
	  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for
	  providing this.  (Also, uninlined ACE_OS::uname on WIN32
	  and VxWorks because it contains string literals.)

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.{i,cpp}: fixed interpretation of units:
	  ACE_hrtime_t is in nanoseconds, so it should be divided by
	  1000000000 to get seconds.  Fixed divs/mods to first divide
	  by 1000, then div/mod.  Thanks to Luca Priorelli
	  <lucapri@mbox.vol.it> for identifying this problem.

	  Also, removed some casts that are no longer necessary, and
	  added some casts of ACE_hrtime_t values to longs to avoid
	  compiler warnings.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing this out.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (unbind): cast "index" to int to avoid
	  signed/unsigned comparison.  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff
	  <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing this out.

	* ace/ReactorEx.cpp (bind): changed type of "current_size" to
	  size_t to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.  Thanks to Matthias
	  Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing this out.

	* ace/Timer_Heap.cpp (ctor, grow_heap): cast unsigned value
	  (i + 1) to int before negating to avoid compiler warning.
	  Thanks to Matthias Kerkhoff <make@cs.tu-berlin.de> for pointing
	  this out.

	* examples/Threads/context_switch_time.cpp (main): added
	  ACE_SCOPE_PROCESS param to ACE_Sched_Params instances so
	  that the test works on WIN32.  Thanks to Luca Priorelli
	  <lucapri@mbox.vol.it> for identifying this problem.

	* ace/Registry.{h,cpp},Registry_Name_Space.{h,cpp},Svc_Conf_Tokens.h,
	  Svc_Conf_{l,y}.cpp,Timer_{Heap,List}.cpp,config-aix-4.2.x.h,
	  config-dgux-4.11-epc.h,config-mvs.h,config-sco-5.0.0-fsu-pthread.h,
	  config-sco-5.0.0-mit-pthread.h,config-sco-5.0.0-nothread.h:
	  added CVS header (Id wrapped in $).

	* netsvcs/clients/Logger/indirect_logging.cpp (main): declare loop
	  index as signed int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Tue Mar 11 07:34:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp: Added some code to illustrate how
 	  the new handle_close() hook for ACE_Timer_{Heap,List} work.

	* ace/Timer_Heap.cpp (cancel): Modified the Timer_Heap and
 	  Timer_Queue so that it will call the handle_close() hook when
 	  Event_Handler's are cancelled.  This is necessary to reclaim
 	  resources.  Thanks to Hamutal Yanay
 	  <Hamutal_Yanay@mail.icomverse.com> for suggesting this.

	* ace/Event_Handler.h (signal): Added a TIMER_MASK, which is
 	  passed to handle_close() when a timer is cancelled.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed a bug by setting LPTSTR lpMsgBuf =
 	  0 on line 524.  Thanks to Mark Wright <markw@odi.com.au> for
 	  reporting this.

Sun Mar  10 13:06:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Mem_Map/IO-tests: Fixed a small bug in "IO_Test.cpp"
 	  file.  In the "int Mmap1_Test::run_test" method I inserted an
 	  lseek to rewind the output file.  With this correction the speed
 	  go up due to IO cache.  Thanks to Sandro Doro
 	  <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting this.

Sun Mar  9 18:24:37 1997  Prashant Jain  <pjain@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* java/src/IOCntlMsg.java (IOCntlMsg): Added two new
	  classes/files, namely IOCntlCmds and IOCntlMsg.

	* java/src/Task.java: Added accessors to get/set the flags of the
	  Task. 

Sun Mar  9 13:06:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Reactor: Fixed an evil bug where the expression
	
	  if (handle >= 0 || handle < this->max_handlep1_)
	  
	  should be
	  
	  if (handle >= 0 && handle < this->max_handlep1_)

	  Thanks to Mark Wright <markw@odi.com.au> for reporting this.

Sun Mar  9 13:06:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* apps/Gateway: Updated the Peer and Gateway applications so that
 	  they don't try to register ACE_STDIN with the Reactor on Win32.

	* apps/Gateway: Changed a bunch of calls to
 	  ACE_Reactor::remove_handler() so that it no longer tries to
 	  remove descriptor 0, but instead uses ACE_STDIN.  Naturally,
 	  this doesn't work due to the way that Win32 implements select()
 	  but at least it compiles...  Thanks to Elliot Lau
 	  <eeklau@post1.com> for reporting this.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/File_Parser: Changed the enumerated type
 	  ERROR to PARSE_ERROR to avoid a name clash with a symbol
 	  reserved by Win32 (barf).  Thanks to Elliot Lau
 	  <eeklau@post1.com> for reporting this.

Sat Mar  8 12:37:44 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Changed the implementation of ACE_Log_Msg so
 	  that all accesses to the lock_ are now through a Singleton.
  	  This makes it possible to define multiple instances of
 	  ACE_Log_Msg within the same thread.  Thanks to Jeff Morgan
 	  <jeff@audioactive.com> for helping track this down.

	* Added support for SCO 5.0.  Thanks to Auturo
 	  <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for these patches.

Thu Mar 06 13:24:04 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (gettimeofday): moved declaration of "result" so
	  that it's not declared on VxWorks, where it's not needed;
	  (stat): added cast of file arg to char * for VxWorks;
	  (thr_getprio): added missing "#else" before ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN (-1).
	  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for
	  reporting these.

	* ace/OS.cpp (sched_param): with STHREADS, map ACE_SCOPE_THREAD
	  to ACE_SCOPE_PROCESS'.

	* ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp: commented out YY_BREAK after ace_yyterminate ()
	  to avoid GHS compiler warning about unreachable statement.
	  Thanks to Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for
	  reporting this.

	* ace/ace.mak: removed Thread_Priority and renamed Scheduling_Params
	  to Sched_Param.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/FD-unserver.cpp (handle_client):
	  added "l" qualifier for sprintf of ACE_OS::getpid ().

	* tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp,
	  examples/Threads/{context_switch_time.cpp,Makefile}:
	  adapted to new thread priority/ACE_Sched_Params.

Wed Mar  5 14:33:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/UNIX_Addr.cpp: Enhanced the implementation of set() so
	  that it works correctly on MVS, which has a different definition
	  of struct sockaddr_un:
	  
	  struct sockaddr_un {                                               
	        unsigned char  sun_len;                                         
		unsigned char  sun_family;                                      
		char  sun_path[108];                                   
	  };

	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting
 	  this.

Wed Mar 05 14:47:14 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.{h,cpp},Makefile; also, renamed Scheduling_Params.* to
	  Sched_Params.* and removed Thread_Priority.*:

	  Major change in scheduling parameters interface:
	  The key change is that there is no longer a special thread priority
	  enum.	 Thread_Priority was changed to int, so applications can do
	  whatever they want.  The ACE_Sched_Params class has some static
	  functions to help do this portably.

	  Here	are the changes from the ACE 4.1.3:

	  1) ACE_Thread_Priority:  removed this class.

	    It contained "priority class" and "thread priority".
	    "Priority class" is platform-specific and doesn't
	    need to be visible in ACE; it is subsumed by scheduling policy,
	    see below.	"Thread priority" is replaced by the global
	    ACE_Sched_Priority typedef in ace/OS.h, see next change.

	  2) ace/OS.h:	added ACE_Sched_Priority typedef (to int)
	     and ACE_SCOPE_THREAD.

	  3) ace/OS.h:	added scheduling policy #defines:  ACE_SCHED_OTHER,
	     ACE_SCHED_FIFO, and ACE_SCHED_RR.	There's an ACE_Sched_Params::
	     Policy typedef that can take one of these values.

	  4) ACE_Sched_Params:	added priority_min (), priority_max (),
	     next_priority (), and previous_priority () functions.  All
	     require an ACE_Sched_Params::Policy argument and take an
	     optional scope argument (to support the distinct thread
	     and process priorities on DEC UNIX).

	     min_priority () and max_priority () have platform-specific
	     and policy-specific values, and direction (the min value may
	     be higher than the max value).  The increment and decrement
	     operations allow applications to iterate over them, etc.,
	     without explicitly specifying the direction of the priority
	     (0 for high or low priority).

	  5) The only way to apply ACE_Sched_Params is through
	     ACE_OS::sched_params (const ACE_Sched_Params &).
	     (This is not really a change, except for the name change from
	     ACE_OS::set_sched_params ().

	     It sets both policy and priority of current thread or
	     process (depending on the scope in ACE_Sched_Params).
	     Not all combinations of policy, priority, and scope are
	     legal on all platforms.  Unfortunately, I see no way around
	     this, because the intersection of legal ranges
	     on our supported platforms is empty.  If an illegal request
	     is made, ACE_OS::sched_params () sets errno to EINVAL and
	     returns -1.

	  6) added ACE_OS::thr_setprio (const ACE_Sched_Priority prio)
	     to set the current thread's priority, only.

	  Many thanks to Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
	  for his careful review of this class design, thoughtful comments,
	  and assistance with implementation, especially for PTHREADS
	  platforms.

Wed Mar  5 14:36:59 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* SString.cpp: Fixed ACE*String initialization bugs. Thanks to
	  jmorey@tbi.com (John Morey) for reporting this.

Wed Mar  5 14:33:04 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Fixed a bug in gethrtime

	  const ACE_Time_Value now = ACE_OS::gettimeofday (void);

	  which should be

	  const ACE_Time_Value now = ACE_OS::gettimeofday ();

	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting
 	  this.

Tue Mar  4 16:37:26 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP-unserver.cpp (main): Make life
 	  easier by doing an unlink(rendezvous) before reopening the
 	  UNIX-domain socket.  Thanks to Jeff Morgan
 	  <jeff@audioactive.com> for suggesting this.

Sun Mar 02 19:58:00 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config*.h: removed #define of ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS
	  because it's no longer needed in the config files:  it's
	  #defined in OS.h if needed.

Sun Mar  2 17:14:29 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude: Updated all the platform-*g++.GNU files so
 	  that they no longer -D__ACE_INLINE__ (since this is handled in
 	  the the config-*g++.h files).

	* ace: Updated all the config-*g++.h files so that they now
 	  #define __ACE_INLINE__ rather than having this set in the
 	  platform_*.GNU file.  This makes ACE easier to build and
 	  integrate with other software packages.

Fri Feb 28 02:22:33 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SOCK_*: There were problems starting UDP broadcast servers
	  (all using the same well known port number) multiple times on
 	  one machine (this is very useful test distributed applications
 	  on one single machine).  Setting the SO_REUSEADDR option for the
 	  broadcast socket allows binding of a socket that is already in
 	  use and thus allows us to start more than one broadcast servers
 	  in parallel on one machine.  Thanks to Dieter Quehl
 	  <dietrich.quehl@med.siemens.de> for this fix.

	  Therefore, I patched ACE_SOCK_Dgram_Bcast, ACE_SOCK_Dgram and
 	  ACE_SOCK to include this feature.  In addition, I also changed
 	  ACE_SOCK_Connector/ACE_SOCK_Acceptor to use this feature instead
 	  of calling setsockopt() there explicitly.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/FD-unserver.cpp (main): Fixed up the
 	  use of ACE_OS::fork() here to use the new "named" version.

	* ace/OS.h: Added a clever new wrapper function called fork (const
 	  char *program_name), which calls fork() and then automatically
 	  calls ACE_LOG_MSG->sync (program_name) to sync up the program
 	  name.  This eliminates a common source of error when forking
 	  children and using ACE_Log_Msg::log().

	* examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/FD-un{client,server}.cpp: Updated the
 	  FD client and FD server programs so that it is now a concurrent
 	  server.

	* ace/config-mvs.h: Added #define ACE_LACKS_TCP_H for MVS.  Thanks
 	  to Chuck Gehr for pointing this out.

	* ace/OS.h: Added a new #define ACE_LACKS_TCP_H that skips the
 	  inclusion of the netinet/tcp.h file if it isn't on the platform.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_cancel): Changed the line

	  ACE_UNUSED_ARG (t_id);

	  to

	  ACE_UNUSED_ARG (thr_id);

	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/SString.cpp: Fixed up all the ACE_[CSW]String code so that
 	  always allocates a rep_ even in the null constructor.  This
 	  saves us from having to handle odd special cases later on...
  	  Thanks to John Morey <JMOREY@tbi.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/Service_Repository.cpp (close): Changed the order in which
 	  services are destroyed when the Service Configurator is closed.
  	  Currently, services are destroyed in the order in which they are
 	  created according to the svc.conf file.  Now, we shut them down
 	  in reverse order.  This makes more sense when services are
 	  related, i.e., one service has to be started before another.
  	  Thanks to Karlheinz for this suggestion.


Fri Feb 28 12:13:09 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: fixed definition of ACE_TIMER_SKEW.  Thanks
	  to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for pointing this out.

Thu Feb 27 21:36:28 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.{i,cpp} (gethrtime):  support on all platforms by
	  using ACE_OS::gettimeofday () if there is no native high
	  resolution timer. Moved ACE_OS::getimeofday () definition
	  toward top of OS.i so that it is always defined before
	  being called.  Finally, expanded gethrtime () support from
	  linux to __GNUC__ with ACE_HAS_PENTIUM; it should work on
	  platforms such as VxWorks with gcc on Pentiums.

	* ace/config-osf1-4.0-{,g++}.h:  added ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME.
	  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
	  for pointing this out.

Thu Feb 27 17:06:12 1997    <harrison@samba.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.h (get_env_global_scale_factor):  This static
	  method will set the global_scale_factor to the value in an
 	  environment variable (ACE_SCALE_FACTOR by default).

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.*: Changed all calculations to divide by
	  scale_factor before doing / and %.  This must be done before the
	  mod for correctness.

	* ace/Profile_Timer.i (start): Changed start and stop methods to
	  call ACE_High_Res_Timer::gettimeofday.  This should allow
	  greater timing accurracy.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.h (global_scale_factor): Added a static
	  global_scale_factor that allows applications to set one scale
	  factor for all high res timers.  This is important for platforms
	  like intel where the scale factor will vary based on the
	  processor clock speed.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.i (gettimeofday): This static method calls
	  ACE_OS::gethrtime and converts to an ACE_Time_Value based on the
	  global_static_factor.

Wed Feb 26 18:28:35 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ACE-install.sh: Added some fixes for the ACE-install.sh script.
  	  Thanks to Eugene R. Somdahl <gene@endo.com> for reporting these.

	* ace/Connector.cpp (handle_close): Added a test to see if the
 	  reactor_ is NULL and if it is, don't bother trying to use it to
 	  clean up.  Thanks to Paul Han <phan@CCGATE.HAC.COM> for this
 	  suggestion.

Tue Feb 25 21:19:57 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h,config-sunos*.h: default ACE_TIMER_SKEW to 0,
	  and override to 10 ms in all Solaris config files.

	* ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp,Makefile: #undef ACE_HAS_TERM_IOCTLS
	  so that /usr/include/sys/termios.h won't be included; it
	  #defines ECHO, and Svc_Conf_l.cpp has an ECHO symbol.

	* ace/ACE.cpp (sock_error): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (error);.

	* ace/Timer_Queue.cpp (ctor): rearranged initializers to
	  match declaration order.

Tue Feb 25 19:57:54 1997    <harrison@samba.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_Queue.cpp (gettimeofday): Added gettimeofday accessors
	  on the Timer_Queue.  The default implementation calls
	  ACE_OS::gettimeofday.  Applications can specify, via pointers to
	  functions, that a timer queue use an alternate gettimeofday
	  implementation (e.g., a high resolution timer).

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (schedule_timer): The Reactor no longer calls
	  ACE_OS::gettimeofday.  Instead, it calls
	  Timer_Queue::gettimeofday.

	* ace/ReactorEx.cpp (schedule_timer): The ReactorEx no longer calls
	  ACE_OS::gettimeofday.  Instead, it calls
	  Timer_Queue::gettimeofday.

Tue Feb 25 17:40:57 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Updated the 'p' option of the log() method to
 	  use the new ACE::sock_error() method for cases where
 	  FormatMessage() fails.

	* ace/ACE: Added a new sock_error() method to class ACE which
 	  returns the appropriate message for each WinSock error code.
  	  This makes up for an apparent oversight in Win32.  Thanks to
 	  Michael R. MacFaden" <mrm@cisco.com> for this.

Tue Feb 25 01:33:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Moved <netinet/tcp.h> outside of the VXWORKS #ifdef
 	  since it seems to be available on other platforms (e.g.,
 	  Solaris).  If people find this not to be the case on all
 	  platforms please let me know and I'll #ifdef it.  Thanks to
 	  Sumedh Mungee <sumedh@cs.wustl.edu> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 25 16:20:29 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-acceptor.cpp: Added a
 	  specific checl for timeouts. Also, changed
 	  ACE_PEER_ACCEPTOR_ADDR to ACE_PEER_STREAM_ADDR

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking/non-blocking.{mak,mdp}: New
	  project files for Win32.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Minor changes.

Mon Feb 24 17:16:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (ACE_Log_Msg): Enable the thread-specific
 	  tracing flag by default.  This ensures that tracing will work
 	  "out of the box."

	* ace/config-sunos5.[45]-g++.h: Added a #define for
 	  ACE_HAS_TERM_IOCTLS.  Thanks to Joey Zhu <joey.zhu@wcom.com> for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/Synch.cpp (acquire): Simplified the recursive mutex logic
 	  for acquire().  Thanks to Arthur J. Lewis" <hfdh99a@prodigy.com>
 	  for reporting this.

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-acceptor.cpp (init): Added
 	  a #ifdef for ACE_WIN32 so that we don't register the signal
 	  handler for SIGPIPE since it's not supported on Win32.  Thanks
 	  to Ivan Murphy <Ivan.Murphy@med.siemens.de> for reporting this
 	  problem.

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking: The SPIPE examples in
	  (test_spipe_{acceptor,connector}.cpp) aren't ported to Win32
 	  yet.  They currently don't work because ACE_SPIPE*'s can't be
 	  registered with the ACE_Reactor (which only works with sockets).
  	  I've #ifdef'd these examples so that they don't get compiled on
 	  Win32.  Thanks to Ivan Murphy <Ivan.Murphy@med.siemens.de> for
 	  reporting this problem.

Mon Feb 24 20:28:10 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: use signed __int64 for ACE_hrtime_t because VC++
	  won't convert unsigned __int64 to double.  Thanks to Irfan
	  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu> for reporting this.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_{irix5.3_g++,linux*,m88k,
	  osf1_4.0_g++,sco-nothread,sunos*g++,unixware_g++}.GNU:
	  changed C++ compiler (CXX) from gcc to g++ so that libg++
	  will be linked in.  Thanks to James CE Johnson <jcej@lads.com>
	  for suggesting this.

	* examples/IOStream/{client,server}/Makefile,tests/Makefile:
	  removed -lg++, when gcc is the compiler, because it's no
	  longer needed with g++ as the compiler.

Sat Feb 22 23:03:45 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: restored version 4.89 and 4.90 changes that
	  were lost in version 4.91.

	* ace/OS.{i,cpp},config-linux*.h: added ACE_OS::gethrtime ()
	  support for Linux on Pentiums.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.*: changed scale_factor type from
	  u_long to double so that it can be less than 1.

	* ace/Thread_Priority.cpp: "linux" instead of "LINUX".

	* tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp (open): set this->priority_ because
	  an assertion uses it.  Also, use ACE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS so that
	  root doesn't have to run the test on Solaris.

Sat Feb 22 22:07:35 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp (open): Now use
	  ACE_Thread_Priority while setting the priority of the new
	  thread.

	* ace/Thread_Priority.cpp (convert_to_os_priority): Changed
	  return type for this to 'int' from 'long' on Linux.  Thanks
	  to James CE Johnson <jjohnson@lads.com> for pointing this
	  out!

	* ace/OS.i (thr_cancel): Corrected erroneous macro argument.
	  Thanks to James CE Johnson <jjohnson@lads.com> for pointing
	  this out!

Sat Feb 22 17:00:59 1997    <harrison@samba.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (gethrtime): Added support for intel's RDTSC
	  instruction for pentium architectures.

Sat Feb 22 10:57:47 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Stream.cpp (open): Make sure that if we allocate the Tasks
 	  in the Stream head and the Stream tail that we set the M_DELETE
 	  flag so that the close() method will clean up the memory.
  	  Thanks to David Levine and Purify for noticing this problem.

Fri Feb 21 08:06:41 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Yikes, it looks like the Solaris and the POSIX version
 	  of sigwait() are different!  The Solaris version returns the
 	  signal number, whereas the POSIX version returns 0 on success,
 	  errno on failure, and sets a parameter with the signal on
 	  success.  I've fixed the ACE_OS C++ wrapper so that the right
 	  thing happens, i.e., errno is always set to the error (if
 	  sigwait() returns -1) and the signum is always returned as the
 	  argument and the return value on success ...  Thanks to Harry
 	  Gunnarsson <hg@carmenta.se> for reporting this.

Fri Feb 21 11:01:22 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Thread_Priority.cpp: fixed return type of
	  convert_to_os_priority () for Linux.  Thanks to
	  James CE Johnson <jcej@lads.com> for pointing this out.

	* examples/Shared_Malloc/test_malloc.cpp,
	  examples/System_V_IPC/SV_Message_Queues/{T,}MQ_Server.cpp (main):
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sa);.

Fri Feb 21 04:12:31 1997    <irfan@TWOSTEP>

	* ace/OS.h: Added ACE_SEH_FINALLY.

	* ace/ReactorEx.h: Added ACE_ReactorEx_Test as a friend class. I
 	  think we should have one such friend class for all classes in
 	  ACE.

	* examples/Reactor/ReactorEx/test_exceptions.cpp: New test which
 	  checks how ReactorEx deals with structured exceptions thrown by
 	  user code

	* ace/ReactorEx.cpp (safe_dispatch): Added protection against
 	  structured exceptions caused by user code when dispatching
 	  handles

Thu Feb 20 17:32:54 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* apps/Gateway: Added a new -v flag to the peerd and gatewayd
 	  applications so that they will print out the strings that are
 	  passed to them.  This makes it easier to debug and see what's
 	  happening.

Wed Feb 19 19:39:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/Concrete_Proxy_Handlers.cpp (recv): Removed
 	  the VERBOSE #ifdefs since they weren't used and were causing
 	  compile errors.  Thanks to Bert Craytor
 	  <Bert_Craytor@peoplesoft.com> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 19 00:39:50 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server: Updated the README file a bit to
 	  clarify some loose ends.  The documentation now explains
 	  precisely how to start up the transceivers correctly.  Thanks to
 	  Patty Genuald <genualdp@agcs.com> for suggesting this.

	* include/makeinclude: Removed the default symlink for
 	  platform_macros.GNU since it is "Solaris-biased" ;-).  Thanks to
 	  Amos Shapira <amos@dsi.co.il> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 19 14:41:18 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Modified to use timer_queue_->gettimeofday().

	* ace/Proactor.cpp: Modified to use timer_queue_->gettimeofday().

	* ace/ReactorEx.cpp: Modified to use
	  timer_queue_->gettimeofday().  Also had to modify the
	  ReactorEx_Notify mechanism to use the ReactorEx's timer queue to
	  call gettimeofday.

	* ace/Timer_Queue.h: Added a gettimeofday method.  This allows
	  applications to replace the timer mechanism used by the
 	  Reactors.  The default implementation returns
 	  ACE_OS::gettimeofday.  However, a real-time application can
 	  inherit from Timer_Queue and override gettimeofday to return a
 	  value from a high resolution timer.

	* STL/bool.h: Changed the defines for type bool.  First, bool is no
	  longer defined for WIN32 since yvals.h typedefs it already.
  	  Also, I moved the defines out the namespace.  I'm not sure if
 	  that's the right thing to do.

Tue Feb 18 16:41:02 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude: Added minor enhancements to rules.local.GNU
 	  and wrapper_macros.GNU so that it works with MVS.  Thanks to
 	  Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for this.

	* include/makeinclude: Added a new platform_mvs.GNU file that
 	  supports builds on MVS!  Thanks to Chuck Gehr
 	  <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for this.

	* tests/TSS_Test.cpp (worker): To get TSS_Test.cpp to compile on
	  MVS we changed line 69 from:

	  ACE_thread_key_t key = 0;
 
          to:
 
          ACE_thread_key_t key = ACE_OS::NULL_key;
 
          and line 122 from:
 
          key = 0;
 
          to:
 
          key = ACE_OS::NULL_key;

	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (dispatch): Fixed the dispatching logic so that
 	  we bail out as soon as we discover that our state has changed.
  	  Thus, we'll recompute the fd_sets used for select().

Tue Feb 18 19:02:53 1997    <irfan@cha-cha.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ReactorEx: 

	(a) Made wakeup_all_threads() public. Thanks to Hamutal Yanay
 	    <Hamutal_Yanay@mail.icomverse.com> for suggesting this.

	(b) Change closed_for_business_ to open_for_business_. Also made
 	    sure that open and close can potentially be called multiple
 	    times from multiple threads.

	(c) Changed unbind and unbind_all such that they iterate through
 	    all the handles.

	(d) Added a check to see if the handle has been scheduled for
 	    deletion before dispatching it.

Tue Feb 18 21:24:57 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/IOStream.h,README: replaced ACE_WIN32 conditional with
	  ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_FX.

	* ace/config-{mvs,win*}.h: added #define ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_FX.
	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for pointing
	  out the need for this support for MVS.

	* examples/Reactor/Misc/test_demuxing.cpp: removed unused
	  variable "done".

	* examples/Reactor/Misc/test_signals_1.cpp (main),
	  examples/Reactor/Ntalker/ntalker.cpp (main):
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sig);.

Tue Feb 18 17:15:24 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace.mdp, ace/mak: Modified release configuration to build
	  acer.dll.

Tue Feb 18 11:43:04 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: removed destructor because it's not declared
	  and it's empty.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_setprio): added another case (that is NOTSUP)
	  for platforms with Pthreads and with LACK_SETSCHED.  Thanks to
	  Chuck Gehr <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for pointing this out.

	* tests/Reactor_Notify_Test.cpp (main): added shutdown flag so
	  that normal termination reaches ACE_END_TEST.

	* tests/Reactors_Test.cpp (worker): changed "timeout" message to
	  "Reactor shutdown" because that indicates normal termination,
	   and won't fool the one-button test.

	* examples/Mem_Map/IO-tests/test_io.cpp (main): added
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sa);.

	* examples/Misc/test_trace.cpp (main): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG
          for sig1 and sig2.

Tue Feb 18 03:50:10 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ReactorEx: 

	  (a) Added a closed_for_business_ flag so that handle_events()
 	      cannot be called after the ReactorEx has been closed down.

	  (b) Transfer of ownership of the ReactorEx to a new owner has
 	      changed. The transfer will not complete until all threads
 	      are ready for it (just like the handle set).
  	      ReactorEx->update_state() now looks out for changes in
 	      ownership.

	* examples/Reactor/ReactorEx/test_MT.cpp:
	  
	  (a) The test now terminates and number of iterations can be
	      specified on the command line.
	      
	  (b) Graceful shutdown of ReactorEx is now exercised in the
 	      test. This is a change for the earlier infinite loop. This
 	      also shows how to gracefully close ReactorEx which is being
	      shared by multiple threads.

	  (c) Timers were added to the test.

	* ace/config{win32}: Added flag ACE_LACKS_LINEBUFFERED_STREAMBUF.

Mon Feb 17 22:37:35 1997  Tim H. Harrison  <harrison@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.h (ACE_RETURN): Modified all ACE_RETURN macros to
	  use ACE_OS::last_error instead of errno.  This makes these more
	  portable to Win32.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Modified Win32 version to use
	  FormatMessage if errnum is greater than sys_nerr.

	* ace/OS.i (last_error): Modified Win32 version to return
	  GetLastError if errno == 0.

Mon Feb 17 18:32:29 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Protected the #ifdef for CLOCK_REALTIME so that it
 	  won't conflict with an existing macro in AIX.  Thanks to Chris
 	  Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for this.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h: Added Local_Name_Space.h to
 	  Local_Name_Space_T.h so that templates will work correctly on
 	  AIX.  Thanks to Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for this.

	* tests: Added a new test, Reactor_Notify_Test.cpp, which tests
 	  out the new max_notify_iterations() method on the Reactor.

	* ace/Reactor: Finished rewriting and testing the new dispatching
 	  logic of the Reactor.  The new implementation guards against
 	  pathological cases where ACE_Event_Handler::handle_*() methods
 	  remove registered ACE_Event_Handler objects whose handles are
 	  pending in the dispatch_set.  Previously there was no good way
 	  to guard against this.  Now, it should be handled automatically.

	* ace: Added many minor fixes to remove warnings with the SGI C++
 	  compiler.  Thanks to Gonzalo Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for
 	  suggesting this.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_irix6.2_sgic++.GNU: Turned on all
 	  the warnings for the SGI C++ compiler.  Thanks to Gonzalo
 	  Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for suggesting this.

Mon Feb 17 20:59:47 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/IOStream.h: added null ipfx (), etc., methods for ACE_WIN32
	  because its iostream class doesn't have them.

 	* ace/OS.h: added #include of <netinet/tcp.h> on VxWorks.

	* ace/Pipe.cpp (open): enabled TCP_NODELAY on VxWorks now that
	  OS.h #includes <netinet/tcp.h>.

	* ace/ReactorEx.h: made ACE_ReactorEx_Handler_Repository destructor
	  virtual because the class has other virtual functions.

	* tests/IOStream_Test.cpp: removed ACE_WIN32 #ifndef, and
	  removed q_char bool conversion operator because it shouldn't
	  be needed.

	* examples/Reactor/Misc/pingpong.cpp (handle_input): cast buf_len
	  to ssize_t to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

	* examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/client/\
	  remote_dgram_client_test.cpp (main): cast mmap.size () to
	  ssize_t to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Feb 17 09:25:08 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-linux-lxpthreads.h: Bumped the Linux kernel version
 	number assigned to the symbol LINUX.  Also added conditional
 	defines for PTHREAD_{MAX,MIN}_PRIORITY when using Xavier Leroy's
 	LinuxThreads.

	* ace/Thread_Priority.cpp: Added convert_to_os_priority() for Linux.
	
Mon Feb 17 03:15:48 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/SOCK_Test.cpp (server): Changed recv_n() to recv().

	* tests/tests.{mak,mdp}: Added two new tests: IOStream and
	  Reactor_Notify.

	* ace/Reactor: Removed all special checks for setting
 	  ACE_Reactor::max_notify_iterations_ on WIN32 to be 1.  This was
 	  made possible after we figured out that the errno was being
 	  reset after the recv() call in handle_input().  This allows
 	  ACE_Reactor_Notify::handle_input() to serve upto
 	  ACE_Reactor::max_notify_iterations_ notifications in one shot
 	  rather than just 1 on WIN32. This should speed up the Reactor on
 	  WIN32 platforms.
	
Sun Feb 16 12:23:23 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Totally rewrote the ACE_Reactor's dispatching
 	  mechanism so that it now keeps track of whether the state of the
 	  wait_set_ has changed during a dispatch (i.e., whenever
 	  register_handler_i() or remove_handler_i() is called).  If the
 	  wait_set_ state *has* changed, then we bail out and rerun
 	  select() in order to get the latest changes.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Changed the implementation of the
 	  ACE_Reactor_Notify class so that (1) it short-circuits a trip
 	  through the ACE_Reactor::notify_handle() method (after all, it's
 	  just going to call its own handle_input() method back) and (2)
 	  the ACE_Reactor_Notify::handle_input() method now returns a
 	  count of the number of handlers that it dispatched.

	* ace/Log_Msg.h: Added a (%P|%t) so that we now print out the
 	  process id and thread number for failed ACE_ASSERT() calls.

	* tests: Removed the unnecessary template specializations of
 	  ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_Thread_Mutex, int> since this is already done
 	  in libACE.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Removed the #ifdef preventing the enabling of
 	  non-blocking mode for the recv() side of the Reactor's
 	  notification pipe (socket) for Win32.  I believe that with the
 	  new max_notify_iterations scheme we should be all set.

	* ace/ReactorEx.cpp: Added an identical API for bounding the
 	  max_notify_iterations() for ReactorEx.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Enhanced the Reactor's notify() mechanism so
 	  that it is now possible to set the max_notify_iterations(),
 	  which limits the number of times that the
 	  ACE_Reactor_Notify::handle_input() method will iterate and
 	  dispatch the ACE_Event_Handlers that are passed in via the
 	  notify pipe before breaking out of its recv() loop.  This is
 	  necessary to keep from starving out other Event_Handlers.
  	  Thanks to Rod Skinner <rods@in.ot.com.au> for pointing out the
 	  need for this.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Fixed a bug in the WIN32
 	  ACE_Reactor_Notify::handle_input() logic.  We were calling
 	  requeue_position(0) when we should have been calling renew().

Sat Feb 15 11:46:39 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ACE.cpp: It appears that VxWorks doesn't support fcntl().
  	  However, it does seem to support ioctl().  Therefore, that's how
 	  we'll set the descriptors into non-blocking mode.  Thanks to
 	  Dave Mayerhoefer <mayerhoefer@svappl36.mdc.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/SOCK_Stream.h: Corrected the documentation for
 	  ACE_SOCK_Stream::recv_n (void *buf, size_t len, int flags, const
 	  ACE_Time_Value *timeout).  Thanks to Paul Roman
 	  <proman@npac.syr.edu> for reporting this.

	* ace/SOCK_Stream.i (recv_n): Fixed a minor bug in the
	  SOCK_Stream.i line 38: 

	  ACE_TRACE ("ACE_SOCK_Stream::send_n");

	  should be

	  ACE_TRACE ("ACE_SOCK_Stream::recv_n");

	  Thanks to Paul Roman <proman@npac.syr.edu> for reporting this.

Fri Feb 14 00:40:14 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/TTY_IO.cpp (control): Moved the drop out timer value from
 	  the ACE struct to the WinNT struct.  Thanks to Brad Flood
 	  <BFLOOD@tcs.lmco.com> for this fix.

Thu Feb 13 21:24:17 1997    <irfan@cha-cha.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (event_wait): Fixed the missing check for success.

	* ace/Synch: Fixed problems with multiple removal of
 	  resources. Thanks to Bert (Bcraytor@aol.com) for pointing this
 	  out.

	* examples/Threads/test.{mdp,mak}: Reorganized project so that it
	  is easier to use. 

	* examples/Threads: Small changes to make tests run faster.	

Thu Feb 13 01:49:38 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (stat): Added stat() to ACE_OS.

	* apps/jaws: The ACE web server has now been ported to Win32. 

	* ace/ReactorEx: Add a new version of remove_handler().

	* examples/Reactor/ReactorEx/test_MT.cpp: Fixed stuff so that only
 	  <concurrent_threads> are activated.

Wed Feb 12 22:58:15 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ReactorEx: Made minor changes to the ReactorEx.

	* examples/Reactor/ReactorEx/test_MT.cpp: Updated Irfan's new
 	  ReactorEx test to use ACE_Tasks.

Wed Feb 12 00:08:42 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ReactorEx: Finished a complete rewrite of
	  ReactorEx.  The new version allows multiple threads of
	  control to wait simultaneously in
	  ::WaitForMultipleObjects(). This was difficult because the 
 	  set of ACE_HANDLEs used in ReactorEx->handle_events() is 
	  shared between all threads.  We devised a clever protocol
	  that ensures all changes to the handle set are
	  serialized. This serialization was achieved by using
	  multiple (auto and manual) events and mutexes and by taking
	  advantage of the "waitAll" semantics of
	  WaitForMultipleObjects().

	  Concept of "owner" thread is introduced in ReactorEx.  We
	  need to keep track of the "owner" because we don't want
	  multiple threads to try to expire timers. Therefore the
	  "owner" thread is the only one allowed to expire
	  timers. Also, the owner thread is the only thread which
	  waits on the internal notify handle (which is used to
	  dispatch explicit calls to
	  ACE_ReactorEx::notify(). Initially, the creator thread of
	  ReactorEx becomes the "owner" thread. Ownership can later be
	  transferred among threads, just as with the standard
	  ACE_Reactor.

	  We also updated the Handler Repository since it now
 	  keeps track of <handle, event_handler> tuples to be added
	  and deleted from the current handle set at the appropriate
	  time (i.e., when all threads are out of
	  WaitForMultipleObjects() and have completed all necessary
	  dispatching).  The Handler_Repository implements the update
	  protocol that is used to serialize changes to its internal
	  state.
	
	  Two slots were added to the <size> parameter in the
 	  constructor and open methods of ReactorEx that will store
 	  handles used for internal management. Therefore, users can add
 	  upto MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS - 2 handles into ReactorEx.  On
	  current WinNT platforms (e.g., 3.51 and 4.0)
	  MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS is 64.

	  Note that the interface to ReactorEx did not change in this
 	  process. Your existing code should work without changes.
	  Moreover, we've optimized the implementation so that if only
	  1 thread calls ACE_ReactorEx::handle_events() the code is
	  very efficient.  Moreover, you can dynamically add or remove
	  threads without having to register them with the ReactorEx.

	* examples/Reactor/ReactorEx/test_MT.cpp: This application tests
 	  multiple threads simultaneously calling
 	  ReactorEx->handle_events(). It also shows how different threads
 	  can update the state of ReactorEx.

Wed Feb 12 00:08:42 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Synch: Added a remove() call to ~ACE_Thread_Mutex so that it
 	  will be removed (and resources cleaned up) automatically when an
 	  ACE_Thread_Mutex object goes out of scope.  Thanks to Jay
 	  Denkberg <jay_denkberg@mail.icomverse.com> for reporting this.

	* ace: Added a new config file (config-irix6.2-sgic++-nothreads.h)
 	  that works for non-Pthread versions of SGI 6.2.  Thanks to Fred
 	  LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for this.

	* ace/XtReactor: Fixed a bunch of minor bugs that crept into the
 	  ACE_XtReactor.  Thanks to Fred LaBar
 	  <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_getprio): Fixed a typo in the #ifdefs so that we
 	  return ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN(-1) if threading isn't enabled.  Thanks
 	  to Fred LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 11 11:26:03 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.{h,i},config-vxworks*.h,README: added ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME,
	  and only support ACE_OS::clock_gettime if that's defined.
	  It can be supported on Solaris 2.5, but -lposix4 is then required.

	* ace/Thread_Priority.*: added increment () and decrement ()
	  operations.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++_4.1.GNU:
	  added -pta back to avoid link problems with template classes
	  that have virtual functions that are all inline, if inlining
	  is disabled.  Though we don't see the problem, other 4.1 users do.
	  Thanks to mscallinan@CCGATE.HAC.COM for reporting this.

	* examples/Logger/simple-server/Logging_Handler.cpp (handle_input):
	  cast "len" to ssize_t to prevent mixed signed/unsigned comparison.

	* examples/Logger/simple-server/server_loggerd.cpp (main):
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sa);.

	* examples/Reactor/Misc/notification.cpp (Thread_Handler ctor):
	  changed type of n_threads argument from int to size_t to avoid
	  signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Feb 10 15:27:02 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_Queue: Added a virtual destructor so that subclasses
 	  deleted via ACE_Timer_Queue *'s will call the right destructor.
  	  Thanks to Stuart Powell <stuartp@in.ot.com.au> for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Timer_Heap.cpp: Added support for automatically growing
 	  ACE_Timer_Heaps.  This allows heaps to grow automatically as new
 	  ACE_Event_Handlers are added dynamically.  Thanks to Stuart
 	  Powell <stuartp@in.ot.com.au> for this enhancement.

	* ace/Memory_Pool: Added support that allows flags to be passed in
 	  to the MMAP_Memory_Pool.  This can be used to set the
 	  appropriate type of backing store semantics (e.g., MAP_PRIVATE
 	  and MAP_SHARED).  Thanks to Fred LaBar
 	  <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for providing this.

Sun Feb  9 11:56:37 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Map_Manager.cpp (bind_i): A recent change to Map_Manager
 	  broke the Connector since errno was getting set to ENOENT rather
 	  than EWOULDBLOCK.  Thanks to Mark Rabotnikov
 	  <mark@usp.elscintcorp.co.il> for finding this.

Sun Feb 09 21:44:34 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ACE.{h,cpp}: added static u_long is_prime ().

	* ace/{OS.cpp,Thread_Priority.cpp}: added comment about thread
	  priorities only being tested for 1003.1C version of Pthreads.
	  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
	  for suggesting this.

	* ace/OS.{h,i}: added ACE_OS::clock_gettime ().  It allows
	  applications to get high-resolution time on POSIX systems.

	* ace/Future.cpp (dump): cast ref_count_ to an int because
	  g++ doesn't figure it out (it's an ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_Thread_Mutex,
	  int>, which does have an int conversion operator).

	* ace/Timer_List.cpp (constructor): added initializer for
	  timer_id_ to prevent unitialized memory read report from Purify.

	* tests/IOStream_Test.cpp,Makefile: added IOStream_Test,
	  complements of James CE Johnson <jcej@lads.com>.  Very cool!

	* tests/Future_Test.cpp: replaced call to ::sin ()
	  with one to ACE::is_prime () to remove dependency on libm.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/UPIPE_SAP/ex1.cpp (peer1, peer2): removed
	  unused variables c_addr and serv_addr: they were replaced by
	  a global.

	* examples/Threads/future{1,2}.cpp: replaced call to ::sin ()
	  with one to ACE::is_prime () to remove dependency on libm.

	* netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/createfile.cpp: removed
	  #include of math.h, it wasn't needed.

Sat Feb 08 15:19:50 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ReactorEx.h: commented out ACE_ReactorEx_Notify::message_queue_
	  declaration if not ACE_WIN32 because Sun C++ chokes on it.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/{FILE,SPIPE}_SAP/client.cpp: declare "len" as
	  ssize_t to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Fri Feb  7 01:13:05 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (select): Simplified Chris' fixes for the weird
	  Linux select() semantics.

	* ace/OS: Added a new accessor method called waiters() in
 	  ACE_cond_t that returns the number of waiters on the condition
 	  variable.  Thanks to Karlheinz for suggesting this.

	* ace/OS: Changed all the ACE_cont_t, ACE_rwlock_t, etc. so that
 	  their fields are private, but made class ACE_OS a friend.
  	  Applications should not be mucking with these fields since they
 	  may change.

	* ace/OS.h: Fixed a minor typo where friend class ACE_rwlock_t
 	  should be friend class ACE_OS.  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann
 	  <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for reporting this.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Added a destructor to ACE_Log_Msg and changed
 	  ACE_TSS_cleanup so that it calls delete (ACE_Log_Msg *) ptr.
  	  Thanks to Per Anderson <Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se> for
 	  reporting this.

	* tests/Map_Manager_Test.cpp: Create a file Map_Manager_Test_Key.h
 	  and move the class Key into the include file.  Include this *.h
 	  file in Map_Manager_Test.cpp.  This is needed for template
 	  generation on AIX.  Thanks to Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for
 	  pointing this out.

Fri Feb  7 17:29:40 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.cpp (set_sched_params): added support for POSIX
	  threads.  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann
	  <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for figuring it out and
	  for providing the code.

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp (test_find): Changed final delete[] to
	  not try to delete a static buffer. :-(

	* tests/SOCK_Test.cpp (server): Added assertion test for
	  modified select timeval.

Fri Feb 07 13:56:24 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/{OS.cpp,Thread_Priority.cpp}: added ACE_Thread_Priority
	  support for Digital Unix.  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann
	  <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for figuring the priorities
	  and priority classes out and for providing the code.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.{h,cpp},config-linux*.h,README:
	  use struct timespec instead of timespec_t, because not all
	  platforms have the timespec_t typedef.  Thanks to
	  Marius Kjeldahl <marius@funcom.com> for reporting this on Linux
	  and Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for reporting it on AIX.

	* ace/IOStream.h: use "ssize_t send (...)", etc., instead of exact
	  function prototypes.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/db-server.cpp: declare struct member as
	  const char * instead of const char [] because it's not static and
	  the struct doesn't have constructors.

	* examples/Reactor/Multicast/server.cpp (Server_Events ctor):
	  reordered initializers to match declaration order.

Fri Feb 07 05:08:51 1997    <irfan@cha-cha.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Synch.cpp (dump): Fixed access error.

	* ace/OS.h: Fixed ACE_rwlock_t friend declaration.

	* ace/OS.i: Moved ACE_cond_t::waiters() such that it is now
 	  visiable to NT. Also fixed ACE_OS::cond_timed_wait by returning
 	  the correct return value on a TIMEOUT. Also fixed typo in
 	  ACE_OS::sema_wait.	

Thu Feb  6 20:25:13 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (select): Adapted ACE_OS::select methods for use on
	  platforms (such as Linux) that allow select(2) to modify its
	  struct timeval arg.  New behavior is triggered by the define
	  ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SELECT_TIMEVAL.  Thanks to Jorn Jensen
	  <jornj@funcom.com> for reporting this!

Thu Feb 06 09:48:43 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-sunos-sun*.h,README: added
	  ACE_LACKS_LINEBUFFERED_STREAMBUF and ACE_LACKS_SIGNED_CHAR.

	* ace/IOStream.{h,cpp}: support
	  ACE_LACKS_LINEBUFFERED_STREAMBUF and ACE_LACKS_SIGNED_CHAR
	  so that this builds with SunC++.

	* examples/IOStream/client/iostream_client.cpp:
	  reordered args and fixed argv indexes.

	* examples/IOStream/server/iostream_server.cpp:
	  use ACE_DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT for default port.

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp (randomize): changed type of "size" arg to
	  size_t to avoid compiler warnings about signed/unsigned comparison.

Thu Feb 06 09:40:47 1997  Chris Cleeland <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-linux*.h: added typedef of timespec_t.

Wed Feb  5 01:45:03 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Changed the Win32 implementation of all methods that call
	  WaitForMultipleObjects() so that errno is set to
	  WAIT_ABANDONED if the mutex is abandoned.  This makes it
	  possible for users to understand why ACE_OS methods that use
	  synchronization operations fail.  Thanks to Ivan Murphy
	  <Ivan.Murphy@med.siemens.de> for reporting this problem.

	* ace/IOStream.cpp (ACE_Streambuf): Moved the const initialization
 	  from the header file to the constructor since this is the only
 	  portable way to do this.  Thanks to Michael Maxie
 	  <maxie@acm.org> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i: Updated the call to thr_setprio() for pthreads so that
 	  it first determines the existing scheduling parameters and then
 	  updates the priority.  Thanks to Thilo Kielmann
 	  <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for help with this.

	* ace/config-osf1-4.0*.h: Updated ACE_NEEDS_HUGE_THREAD_STACKSIZE
 	  to be 1 mega to minimize porting surprises.  Thanks to Thilo
 	  Kielmann <kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> for help with this.

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp: Cleaned up a few minor things related to
 	  int i = 0 vs. size_t i = 0.

	* ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp: Added a new macro called
 	  ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_MSG_NAME, which is used on platforms (e.g.,
 	  DG/UX) that require a cast to (struct sockaddr *) for the
 	  msg_name field of struct msghdr.

Wed Feb 05 10:45:41 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/IOStream.h: replaced __*manip with expanded types, because
	  Sun C++ doesn't have those typedefs; and added complete prototypes
	  for send, recv, send_n, and recv_n.

	* ace/IOStream.cpp: fixed "#define ACE_IOSTREAM_C" to keep g++ sane.

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager.{h,cpp},Map_Manager.{h,cpp}: replaced
	  DEFAULT_SIZE with ACE_DEFAULT_MAP_SIZE so that Naming_Test runs
	  on SunC++ 4.1.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.*: added optional scale factor.

	* examples/IOStream/{client,server}/Makefile:  addd -g++ if building
	  with gcc.

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp: moved declaration of "i" out of for loop
	  because it is used after the loop.

	* examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_server/{Consumer,Supplier}_Router.cpp
	  (open): return 1 if init () succeeds.  There's a commented-out
	  call to activate the objects that would (should?) return a value.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO-client.cpp (main): declare n
	  as ssize_t instead of size_t to avoid compiler warning about
	  signed/unsigned comparison.

Tue Feb  4 19:06:52 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Signal.cpp: Fixed all the ACE_Sig_Handler[s] methods so that
 	  they now use ACE_Guard, rather than ACE_TSS_Guard, *unless* they
 	  are actually performing callbacks to user-code.  Not only is
 	  this faster, but it also avoids thread-specific storage key
 	  leaks on platforms like Solaris!

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_keyfree): Added a new #ifdef for
 	  ACE_HAS_THR_KEYDELETE, which is defined for UNIXWARE.  This
 	  fixes a nasty problem with leaking thread-specific keys.  Thanks
 	  to Nigel Owen <Nigel@voicelink.co.nz> for reporting this.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Added a #include for
	  "ace/Service_Config.h".

	* ace/Malloc.i: Fixed a few warnings by removing the names of
 	  unused parameters.

	* ace: Added many minor changes to ACE so that it will work on
 	  DG/UX.  Thanks to Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org> for all these.

	* ace/LSOCK_Stream.cpp: Applied the same fix as to LSOCK.cpp.

	* ace/LSOCK.cpp: Removed the cast of 0 to (char *) for msg_name
 	  since some platforms use (struct sockaddr *).  By omitting the
 	  cast the compiler will figure it out correctly.  Thanks to
 	  Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org> for this.

	* ace/IOStream: Added a new template adapter for creating an
 	  iostream-like object using an ACE IPC Stream for the actual I/O.
  	  Thanks to James CE Johnson <jcej@lads.com> for this.

	* examples/Misc/test_iostreams.cpp: Added a test that illustrates
 	  how the new ACE_iostreams mechanism works.  Thanks to James CE
 	  Johnson <jcej@lads.com> for this.

	* ace/Message_Block: Updated the ACE_Message_Block implementation
 	  to use ACE_Service_Config::alloc() if the user doesn't supply a
 	  customize version.  This also means that we never delete the
 	  allocator_strategy_, so we can remove this flag and reduce the
 	  amount of storage by 4 bytes.  Thanks to Irfan for noticing that
 	  we can do this.

	* ace/platform_dgux4_epc.h: Added a new platform config file
	  for DG/UX.  Thanks to Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org> for
	  this.

	* ace/config-dgux-4.11-epc.h: Added a new config file for DG/UX.
  	  Thanks to Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org> for this.

Tue Feb 04 18:26:01 1997    <irfan@cha-cha.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Service_Config.cpp (alloc): The implementation now creates a
 	  ACE_New_Allocator rather than a ACE_Allocator_Adaptor.  If
	  you still want the old behavior, simply provide your own
	  custom allocator singleton for ACE_Service_Config.

	* ace/OS.i (mktemp): Added the missing ACE_INLINE directive.

	* ace/OS.h: ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS is now automatically defined
	  when __ACE_INLINE__ is defined.  This avoids mysterious linking
	  problems that occur otherwise.

	* ace/Malloc: Added a virtual destructor to ACE_Allocator.  Also
 	  added a new class ACE_New_Allocator which is a sub-class of
 	  ACE_Allocator. This class uses the new/delete operators to
 	  allocate and free up memory.  Please note that the only methods
 	  that are supported are malloc() and free(). All other
	  methods are no-ops.  If you require more functionality, please use:
 	  ACE_Allocator_Adapter <ACE_Malloc <ACE_LOCAL_MEMORY_POOL,
 	  MUTEX>> This will allow you to use the added functionality of
 	  bind/find/etc. while using the new/delete operators.

Mon Feb  3 15:35:24 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-aix-*.h: Added a (char *) cast to
 	  ACE_DEFAULT_BASE_ADDR.  Thanks to John Cosby
 	  <John.D.Cosby@cpmx.saic.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.cpp: Added a new set() method that sets the Time_Value
 	  from a double.  Thanks to Brad Flood for this suggestion.

	* ace/OS: Changed ACE_OS::flock_t to ACE_OS::ace_flock_t to avoid
 	  a name clash on DG/UX.  Thanks to Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org>
 	  for reporting this.

Tue Feb  4 03:02:52 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp: Added timing and made debug print outs
 	  optional. Also added randomization of the test data.

	* ace/OS.h: Fixed prototype for gethrtime ()

Mon Feb 03 21:00:56 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: define ACE_SCOPE_PROCESS and ACE_SCOPE_THREAD
	  even if ACE_HAS_THREADS is not defined.  Thanks to
	  Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org> for pointing this out.

	* examples/Threads/{process_mutex.cpp,process_semaphore.cpp,
	  task_three.cpp,thread_manager.cpp,thread_specific.cpp} (main):
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sa);.

	* examples/Threads/reader_writer.cpp: fixed declaration of
	  "shared_data" to be "static volatile" instead of "volatile
	  static", and removed unused variable "n".

	* examples/Threads/thread_pool.cpp: removed unused variable "result".

Sun Feb 02 21:24:02 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: changed hrtime_t to ACE_hrtime_t.

	* ace/{config-win*.h,README}: added #define ACE_HAS_PENTIUM to
	  enable gethrtime () support.

	* ace/High_Res_Time.{h,i,cpp}: removed platform-specific #ifdef's,
	  instead added "unsupported ()" static member function; changed
	  changed signature of elapsed_time to take time reference as
	  argument instead of return value; added elapsed_time
	  (ACE_Time_Value &) and elapsed_time_incr (ACE_Time_Value &).

	* examples/Thread/context_switch.cpp: use ACE_High_Res_Timer
	  instead of the old Timer adapter.

	* ace/config-aix-4.1.x.h: fixed typo: #defind ACE_HAS_LONGLONG_T.

	* ace/config-aix-4.2.x.h: added #define ACE_HAS_LONGLONG_T.

	* ace/Thread_Priority.{h,cpp}: moved #include of OS.h from .cpp
	  to .h file.

Sun Feb 02 10:30:29 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Local_Name_Space.cpp: removed ACE_Map_Manager, ACE_Map_Iterator,
	  and ACE_Map_Entry: they don't appear to be used and, without
	  including their headers, this file won't compile.

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager.cpp (Hash_Map_Manager (ACE_Allocator *)):
	  reordered initializers to match declaration order.

Sat Feb  1 15:11:28 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_aix4.2.GNU (LD): Removed the -qnoro
 	  flag since it is no longer needed.  Thanks to Rob Jordan
 	  <jordan@hursley.ibm.com> for reporting this.

Sat Feb  1 03:25:21 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SString.cpp: Added two methods to the wide string
 	  implementation for high-performance. Even though these methods
 	  are somewhat ugly and not the "OO" way of doing things,
 	  performance was at stake here.

	* ace/Registry_Name_Space.cpp (resolve): Fixed the implementation
	  by correctly figuring out the size of the value in the
	  Registry. This allows us to dynamically allocated the correct
	  amount of memory.

	* ace/Registry: Fixed the constant MAX_CONTEXT_NAME_SIZE to be the
	  maximum path length.

	* ace/Naming_Context.cpp: Fixed various memory leaks.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h: Replaced the simple-minded Map_Manager
	  with the new (improved) Hash_Map_Manager.	

	* ace/Local_Name_Space.cpp: Added new methods operator!= and hash
 	  required by the map.

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager.cpp (ACE_Hash_Map_Manager): Added an extra
	  constructor.

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp: Removed memory leaks.

Fri Jan 31 19:39:48 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager.cpp (ctor): reordered initializers
	  to match declaration order.

	* tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp: cast double argument to long
	  because there no longer is a constructor that takes a double.

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager.{h,cpp}: removed #include of
	  ace/Hash_Map_Manager.i because it doesn't exist.
	  Protected .cpp file against multiple includes.  Moved
	  #include of "ace/Malloc.h" from .h to .cpp file.

	* ace/Map_Manager.cpp (current_size, total_size): cast -1 to
	  size_t to avoid warning about signed-to-unsigned conversion.

	* ace/OS.h: moved hrtime_t typedef for ACE_WIN32 so it doesn't
	  get defined twice.

	* ace/OS.i (getservbyname): one last ACE_HAS_NONCONST_GETBY change:
	  missed "lproto" to "proto".

	* bin/create_ace_build: added checks for existing symlinks, so
	  now the script can be re-run safely at any time on a build
	  tree to update it.

Fri Jan 31 02:16:30 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-aix-*.h: Made the default value for
 	  ACE_DEFAULT_BASE_ADDR 0x80000000 to work around restrictions
 	  with AIX.  Thanks to Rob Jordan <jordan@hursley.ibm.com> for
 	  this.

	* examples/Map_Manager: Added a new example of the
	  Hash_Map_Manager.

	* tests/Map_Manager: Integrated the Hash_Map_Manager into the
 	  Map_Manager test and greatly improved the test (e.g., by adding
 	  timing).

	* ace: Added a new implementation of the Map_Manager called
 	  Hash_Map_Manager.  This, of course, uses hashing rather than
 	  linear search.  The result should be a much faster
 	  implementation for many types of applications. 

Thu Jan 30 13:55:08 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Map_Manager: Changed the return type of total_size() and
 	  current_size() to size_t.

	* ace/OS: Had to remove the ACE_Time_Value (double) constructor
 	  since it caused ambiguities with ACE_Time_Value (long).  Thanks
 	  to Per Andersson for figuring this out.
  
	* include/makeinclude/platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU (CXX): Added
 	  -D_REENTRANT to make things work correctly in MT programs.
  	  Thanks to Marius for this fix.

	* ace/OS.h: Added several extra constructors for ACE_Time_Value so
 	  that it won't cause problems with the new ACE_Time_Value
	  (double) constructor.

	* ace/Log_Record.cpp (ACE_Log_Record): Added an "L" to the 0
 	  initial value used for time_stamp_.  Thanks to Marius for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace: Added the new config-aix-4.2.x.h file, which supports the
 	  AIX4.2 platform.  Thanks to Rob Jordan <jordan@hursley.ibm.com>
 	  for this.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_aix4.2.GNU: Added support for the
 	  new AIX4.2 platform.  Thanks to Rob Jordan
 	  <jordan@hursley.ibm.com> for this.
 
	* ace/OS.h: It's now possible to override ACE_DEFAULT_BASE_ADDR in
 	  a config.h file.  This is important for platforms that need to
 	  put shared memory segments at particular address ranges.  Thanks
 	  to Rob Jordan <jordan@hursley.ibm.com> for suggesting this.

Thu Jan 30 16:01:37 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/{config-aix-4.1.x.h,README}: added ACE_HAS_AIX_HIRES_TIMER,
	  see change to gettimeofday in OS.i below; and ACE_HAS_LONGLONG_T.

	* ace/OS.i (gettimeofday, gethrtime): use read_real_time () if
	  ACE_HAS_AIX_HIRES_TIMER.  Thanks to Bob Olson
	  <olson@mcs.anl.gov> for this suggestion.

	* ace/OS.h: define hrtime_t as long long if ACE_HAS_AIX_HIRES_TIMER.

	* ace/OS.{i,cpp}: uninlined ACE_OS::gethostbyname (),
	  and ACE_OS::inet_ntoa () on VxWorks, because they have
	  static char arrays.

	* ace/OS.i (gethostbyaddr, getservbyname, gethostbyaddr,
	  gethostbyname, getservbyname_r): with ACE_HAS_NONCONST_GETBY,
	  instead of copying the const argument, just cast it to (char *).
	  Thanks to Michael Maxie <maxie@acm.org> for pointing out the
	  problem with the nonstatic char arrays with sizes determined at
	  runtime.

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.*: added ACE_HAS_AIX_HIRES_TIMER support.
	  Also, renamed get_time () to elapsed_microseconds ().

	* examples/Threads/{Timer.h,context_switch_time.cpp}:
	  ACE_High_Res_Timer::elapsed_microseconds () instead of
	  ACE_High_Res_Timer::get_time ().

	* bin/create_ace_build: added this script: it creates an ACE build
	  tree in directory "build/<build name>" below the current
	  directory, which must be a ACE "top level" directory (such as
	  $WRAPPER_ROOT).  The build tree directory structure mirrors that
	  of the ACE top level directory structure, except that instead of
	  containing any plain files, it contains only symlinks to the files
	  in the ACE top level structure.

Thu Jan 30 06:57:50 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Thread_Priority.cpp (convert_to_os_priority): changed
	  switch (priority_class) to switch (priority_class_).
	  Thanks to Chris Lahey <CLahey@cccis.com> for pointing this out.
	  Also, return -1 on other than Solaris, Win32, and VxWorks.

Wed Jan 29 22:05:01 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp: Added the prefix "test_" to the bind(),
 	  find(), rebind(), and unbind() functions.  This avoids name
 	  clashes with the bind() call from the socket API.  Thanks to
 	  Marius for this info.
	  
	* ace/OS.cpp (ACE_Time_Value): Added a new constructor that makes
 	  it possible to construct an ACE_Time_Value from a double.
  	  Thanks to Brad Flood <BFLOOD@tcs.lmco.com> for this.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_join): If ACE_HAS_THREADS is defined, but none of
 	  the threading APIs match (e.g., AIX) then we'll return
 	  ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN(-1).  Thanks to Chris Lahey for help with
 	  this.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_aix.GNU: Made some changes to the
 	  type of dynamic linker and libraries used by AIX 4.1.  Thanks to
 	  Chris Lahey for help with this.

	* ace/config-aix-4.1.x.h: Changed from BSD 4.3 to 4.4.  Thanks
	  to Chris Lahey for help with this.

Wed Jan 29 09:03:48 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: moved ACE_id_t and ACE_pri_t typedefs out of the
	  ACE_HAS_THREADS section.

	* ace/OS.cpp: fixed ACE_OS::set_sched_params on Win32 and VxWorks.

	* ace/Scheduling_Parameters.*, ace/Thread_Priority.*: updated
	  comments.

	* examples/Threads/{context_switch_time.cpp,Timer.h,Makefile}:
	  added context switch timing test.  Currently only works on
	  Suns because that's the only platform for which ACE has a
	  high-resolution timer.

	* Makefile: added chmod of VERSION file in TIMESTAMP macro.

Wed Jan 29 00:59:12 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU (CXX): Removed
 	  the -D_MIT_POSIX_PTHREADS symbol since we're using Xavier's
 	  threads instead.  Thanks to Marius Kjeldahl <marius@funcom.com,
 	  mariusk@sn.no> for reporting this.

	* ace/config-linux-lxpthreads.h: Removed the _MIT_POSIX_PTHREADS
 	  symbol since we're using Xavier's threads instead.  Thanks to
 	  Marius Kjeldahl <marius@funcom.com, mariusk@sn.no> for reporting
 	  this.

Tue Jan 28 23:32:58 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SString: Added hash() methods to each ACE String class so
 	  that we can use this with the new ACE_Hash_Set implementation of
 	  ACE_Map_Manager.

	* ace/ACE.h (ACE): Added a UNICODE version of hash_pjw() so that
 	  we can use it to hash ACE_WString.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_setprio): Fixed a typo that was left over from a
 	  previous change.  Thanks to Fred LaBar
 	  <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for reporting this.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/{proxy_config,consumer_config}: Added
 	  comments to these config files so they are easier to understand.
  	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for motivating this.

	* apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp: Changed the name from connection_id_
 	  to proxy_id_, which is more accurate.

	* apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp: Added a destructor to Peer_Handler
 	  so that it can clean itself up properly when shutdown with a
 	  signal.  This fixes a nasty bug.

	* ace/config-win32-msvc4.x.h (ACE_HAS_MFC): By default, ACE now
 	  enables ACE_HAS_MFC.  This makes it possible to use
 	  AfxBeginThread() with the ACE_THR_AFX flag.

	* ace/OS.cpp: Fixed a typo in the call to ::AfxBeginThread()
 	  function.  Thanks to Karlheinz for reporting this.

	* apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp: Removed all uses of the Map_Manager
 	  from the Peer.  There's only ever one connection from a Gateway
 	  per-Peer, so what was this doing here anyway?!  It was causing
 	  problems due to multiple deletions, so removing it improves
 	  robustness of the tests.

	* ace/OS.i: Commented out the "extern char **_sys_siglist"
 	  definition since this was conflicting with the definition in
 	  Solaris.  If some platforms needs this, we'll need to add a
 	  specific #ifdef.

Tue Jan 28 21:57:45 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.{h,cpp}:  added ACE_OS::set_sched_params ().  It permits
	  platform-independent setting of thread priorities and
	  priority classes.  It is currently supported on Solaris,
	  Win32, and VxWorks.

	* ace/Scheduling_Parameters.{h,i,cpp},
	  ace/Thread_Priority.{h,i,cpp}, ace/Makefile:
	  Added these two classes to support ACE_OS::set_sched_params ().

Tue Jan 28 12:42:39 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace.mdp: Added the "Using MFC in a Shared DLL" flags.

	* tests/test_config.h (ACE_INIT_LOG): Made this UNICODE safe.

	* tests/Pipe_Test.cpp (main): Added an iteration count to control
	  the number of children created by the main process.

	* ace/Memory_Pool.cpp (init_acquire): cast this->minimum_bytes_ to
	  size_t to avoid compiler warning if size_t is unsigned.

	* ace/OS.h: Added strncat to the OS class.

Tue Jan 28 09:13:00 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ACE.cpp (ACE::ldfind),
	  ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp,
	  ace/Local_Token.cpp (ACE_TPQ_Entry::ACE_TPQ_Entry),
	  ace/Log_Msg.cpp (ACE_Log_Msg::msg, ACE_Log_Msg::find),
	  Memory_Pool.cpp (ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool::ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool),
	  ace/Naming_Context.cpp (ACE_Naming_Context::open),
	  ace/Parse_Node.cpp (ACE_Location_Node::open_handle),
	  ace/Registry.cpp (ACE_Predefined_Naming_Contexts::is_local_host, 
                ACE_Registry::Binding_Iterator::Object_Iteration::next_n,
		ACE_Registry::Binding_Iterator::Context_Iteration::next_n),
	  tests/UPIPE_SAP_Test.cpp:
	  changed "sizeof char" to "sizeof (char)" because g++ and Sun C++
	  (properly) choked on it.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp (create_manager_i):
	  -- ::strncat () instead of ACE_OS::strcat ()
          -- "lock_name_for_backing_store" instead of
	     "lock_name_for_local_name_space"

	* ace/Naming_Context.cpp (both constructors): reordered
	  initializers to match declaration order.
 
	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU: removed
	  -fno-strict-prototypes because it's not needed with SunOS 5.5.1.

Mon Jan 27 21:33:00 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Naming_Test.cpp (main): Made modifications to the test to
	  make it more dynamic.  Also made it work with UNICODE and
	  ACE_Naming_Context.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp (create_manager_i): Added a better
	  naming scheme for the locks.

	* ace: Changed the calculations of string lengths such that the
 	  size of the character type is carefully considered.

	  The following were affected:
	  
	  ACE.cpp (ACE::ldfind)
	  Local_Token.cpp (ACE_TPQ_Entry::ACE_TPQ_Entry)
	  Log_Msg.cpp (ACE_Log_Msg::msg, ACE_Log_Msg::find)
	  Memory_Pool.cpp (ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool::ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool)
	  Naming_Context.cpp (ACE_Naming_Context::open)
	  Parse_Node.cpp (ACE_Location_Node::open_handle)
	  Registry.cpp (ACE_Predefined_Naming_Contexts::is_local_host, 
                ACE_Registry::Binding_Iterator::Object_Iteration::next_n,
		ACE_Registry::Binding_Iterator::Context_Iteration::next_n)
			
	* ace/OS.h: Added UNICODE support for ACE_DEFAULT_LOCALNAME.

	* ace/Proactor.cpp: Redid "lost" changes to add UNICODE support to:

	  /* Proactor */
          ACE_Overlapped_File::ACE_Overlapped_File
          ACE_Overlapped_File::open

	* ace/Registry_Name_Space.h: Changed the order of #include and
	  #define as that the correct set of MACROS are defined for the
	  include files.

	* tests/MM_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp: Added UNICODE support.
	
Mon Jan 27 09:16:03 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU,
	  include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++_orbix.GNU,
	  ace/config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.x-orbix.h
	  ace/config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.x.h:
	  disabled exception handling by commenting out ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS
	  in the config files and adding -noex to the platform files,
	  because it causes trouble, at least on MP machines.

Mon Jan 27 14:54:31 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Memory_Pool.h: Added code to ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool_Options to
 	  take a minimum_bytes parameter.  This is needed to prevent mmap
 	  remapping when a large segment is requested.  Thanks to Fred
 	  LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for this.

Sun Jan 26 13:39:13 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Changed the typo sis_siglist to sys_siglist.  Also,
 	  changed the logic from #if !defined (ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST) to
	  #if defined (ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST) since this makes more sense...
  	  Thanks to Nanbor Wang <nw1@cs.wustl.edu> for noticing this.

Sat Jan 25 20:30:23 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.1.h: commented out ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS
	  #define because -noex is required with it, and that causes core
	  dump during thread exit on multiprocessor UltraSparcs.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++_4.1.GNU: added -noex
	  back because of core dump during thread exit on
	  multiprocessor UltraSparcs.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Event_Analyzer.cpp,
	  examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/Event_Analyzer.cpp (control):
	  added "default" case to switch statement to eliminate compiler
	  warnings about enumeration values not being handled in switch.

	* examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/event_server.cpp (consumer):
	  removed unused variable "iter".

Sat Jan 25 12:50:24 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Updated all the cond_timedwait() and cond_wait()
 	  methods so that they decrement the count of waiters by one even
 	  when errors occur.  Thanks to Irfan for finding this.

	* ace/Map_Manager.cpp: Updated the ACE_Map_Iterator code so that
 	  it no longer crashes if the Map has been closed.  Thanks to
	  Slawomir Kuzniar <kuzniar@Bear.COM> for reporting this.

Sat Jan 25 11:34:56 1997  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SOCK_Connector.cpp (complete): Added a sleep of zero seconds
	  which allows non-blocking connects to work properly on NT.

	* ace/config-winnt-4.0-msvc4.x.h and config-win32-msvc4.x.h: 
	  Added ACE_HAS_BROKEN_NON_BLOCKING_CONNECTS.

	* ace/OS.i: Moved out all code for Time_Value from #if region. It
	  is common to all.

	* ace/Reactor: Added helper routines to stop the VC++ compiler from
	  bitching about destructors in exception handling code.

	* ace/ace.{mak,mdp}: Removed Time_Value.cpp from project.

	* tests/tests.{mak,mdp}: Corrected the creation of SOCK_Test and
	  Message_Blob_Test executables and temporary files.

Fri Jan 24 09:01:50 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/Connection/misc/Connection_Handler.cpp: added
	  specialization of ACE_Svc_Handler<ACE_SOCK_STREAM, ACE_NULL_SYNCH>
	  so that subproject will build with g++ without optimization.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/Proxy_Handler.cpp: added specializations
	  of ACE_Svc_Handler<ACE_SOCK_STREAM, ACE_SYNCH> and
	  ACE_Svc_Handler<ACE_SOCK_STREAM, ACE_NULL_SYNCH>
	  so that subproject will build with g++ without optimization.

	* tests/Reactor_Exceptions_Test.cpp (main): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG
	  for argc and argv when ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS is not defined.

	* performance-tests/Misc/test_mutex.cpp: made destructor of
	  Thread_Mutex_Derived virtual because the class has other virtual
	  functions.

Thu Jan 23 11:51:45 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-sunos5.5-g++.h: commented out ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS because
	  -fhandle-exceptions is broken in g++ 2.7.2 (and is required in order
	  to use exception handling); also, added ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS, if
	   __ACE_INLINE__ is #defined.

	* ace/config-sunos5.5-sunc++-4.1.h: added ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS,
	  if __ACE_INLINE__ is #defined.

Wed Jan 22 15:04:47 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Moved the ACE_TIMER_SKEW macro to below the #inclusion
 	  of config.h and updated it so that it can be overridden in the
 	  config.h file if necessary.  Thanks to Bob Olson
 	  <olson@mcs.anl.gov> for motivating this.

	* ace/OS.cpp: Fixed the implementation of
 	  ACE_Thread_ID::operator== so that it works correctly when thread
 	  ids and thread handles aren't ints.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i (thr_getprio): Moved a stray #else into the right
 	  place.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i (sema_post): this->count_++ should have been
 	  s->count_++.  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for reporting this.

	* ace/Synch_T.cpp: Added an extern "C" definition for
 	  ACE_TSS_C_cleanup().  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for reporting this.

	* ace: Added a new #define called ACE_LACKS_SYS_NERR to the
	  config files for MVS and VxWorks.  This is used in OS.cpp
	  as follows:

	  #if defined (ACE_LACKS_SYS_NERR)
	  int sys_nerr = ERRMAX + 1;
	  #endif /* ACE_LACKS_SYS_NERR */

	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for reporting this.

	* Removed all #inclusions of "ace/Time_Value.h."  This file
	  no longer contains anything besides a #include "ace/OS.h"
	  and is only kept around due to backwards compatibility.

	* ace: Moved the contents of Time_Value.h into OS.h to reduce the
 	  confusion that arises from the #inclusion of "config.h" in
 	  Time_Value.h.  Also merged the contents of Time_Value.{i,cpp}
 	  into OS.{i,cpp}.  Thanks to the MDA guys for motivating this.

	* tests/Reactor_Exceptions_Test.cpp: Added a new test that
 	  exercises the Reactor with C++ exceptions.  Thanks to Luca for
 	  the test.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (handle_events): Added Win32 structured
 	  exception handling support to the ACE_Reactor::handle_events()
 	  method so that it correctly releases the token lock when Win32
 	  SEH occur in callback routines.  Thanks to Luca for reporting
 	  this problem.

	* ace: Added a new macro called ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS, which
 	  indicates that the compiler supports C++ exception handling.

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++*.GNU: Commented out
 	  the -noex flag for now.  Hopefully, things will work correctly
 	  now.

	* ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (exit): Removed the final acquire() on
 	  ace_mon, which is no longer necessary since the Guard classes
 	  now keep track of whether they are "owned".  Thanks to Karlheinz
 	  and Detlef for this fix.

Wed Jan 22 09:05:31 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* Makefile,VERSION: modified top-level Makefile (and VERSION)
	  to add a timestamp to the VERSION file if creating a release
	  from the /project/adaptive/ACE_wrappers directory.  If it
	  causes problems, this will disable it:
	  % make  TIMESTAMP=  release.

	* ace/Local_Tokens.cpp (dump): replaced "ACE_TSS<ACE_TPQ_Entry>"
	  with "ACE_TPQ_ENTRY" so that ACE_NO_TSS_TOKENS is supported.

	* ace/Synch.h: fixed typo in comment header for ACE_Thread_Semaphore

	* ace/config-vxworks-ghs-1.8.h,config-vxworks5.2-g++.h,
	  config-unixware-2.01-g++.h:
	  protect ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS #defined with
	  #if defined (__ACE_INLINE__).

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/Event_Channel.cpp (open): added
	  ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sig);.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Peer_Router.h:
	  declared a friend of class Peer_Router_Context because it
	  has a private destructor, to eliminate compiler warning
	  about not having any friends.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Supplier_Router.cpp
	  (open): added return 0 in "true" branch of if statement so
	  that the function always returns a value.

Tue Jan 21 09:19:44 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Reader_Writer_Test.cpp (reader): commented out unused
	  variable "n"; also, commented out unused function
	  print_usage_and_die.

	* tests/TSS_Test.cpp, Thread_Manager_Test.cpp (main): added
	  ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sa);.

	* tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp (open):  added return 0 at end.

Tue Jan 21 11:00:12 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway/Gateway.cpp (parse_args): There was a small
 	  bug in parse_args (latest beta), it mixed proxy and consumer
 	  conf files.  Thanks to Per Andersson
 	  <Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se> for reporting this.

Mon Jan 20 13:29:28 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i, ace/Task.h, and ace/Thread_Manager.h: changed a few
	  occurrences of NULL to 0 (for other than Win32 platforms),
	  primarily to avoid compiler warnings on VxWorks if ACE.h isn't
	  #included before stddef.h.

	* netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.cpp
	  (handle_input): replaced %d format with %hu for u_short arg.

	* netsvcs/clients/Tokens/deadlock/deadlock_detection_test.cpp
	  (run_writer): initialized variable "t" to avoid compiler warning.

	* examples/Connection/misc/Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_timeout):
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (tv); also, added explicit int return type
	  to definition of Connection_Handler::close (u_long).

	* examples/Threads/task_four.cpp (Invoker_Task::svc):
	  moved declaration of "task" out of for loop because it is
	  also used after the for loop.

	* netsvcs/lib/Name_Handler.cpp, Server_Logging_Handler.cpp,
	  TS_Clerk_Handler.cpp, TS_Server_Handler.cpp, Token_Handler.cpp:
	  added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (sig);.

Sun Jan 19 11:10:49 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU,
	  platform_sunos5_sunc++_4.1.GNU:
	  added comment about compiler warnings with +w option.
	  Also, added +w to platform_sunos5_sunc++_4.1.GNU.  With the
	  other changes in this ChangeLog entry, there no longer should
	  be significant warnings from Sun C++ when building ACE.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Peer_Router.cpp
	  (Peer_Handler::put): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (tv);.

	* examples/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/NPServer.cpp (main),
	  netsvcs/clients/Tokens/invariant/invariant.cpp (main):
	  commented out argc and argv.

	* examples/Mem_Map/file-reverse/file-reverse.cpp (main):
	  removed unused variable "cp".

	* netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp (handle_input,
	  handle_exception): added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (fd); and
	  (create_proxy): added return statement at end:  even
	  though it should never be reached, it eliminates a
	  compiler warning.

	* examples/OS/Process/process.cpp,
	  examples/Reactor/Misc/test_reactors.cpp,
	  netsvcs/clients/Tokens/deadlock/deadlock_detection_test.cpp,
	  netsvcs/clients/Tokens/mutex/test_mutex.cpp,
	  netsvcs/clients/Tokens/rw_lock/rw_locks.cpp,
	  performance-tests/TTCP/ORBeline/ttcp_i.cpp,
	  performance-tests/TTCP/Orbix/ttcp_i.cpp (main):
	  return 0 instead of 42.

Sat Jan 18 10:54:25 1997  Prashant Jain  <pjain@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* java/src/README: Updated the README file to indicate how
	  documentation for Java ACE cab be automatically generated.

Fri Jan 17 11:47:10 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Added an equivalent set of
 	  ACE_LSOCK_{STREAM,ACCEPTOR,CONNECTOR} macros to complement the
 	  ones for ACE_SOCK_*.  Thanks to Gonzalo Diethelm
 	  <gonzo@ing.puc.cl> for suggesting this.

	* ace/OS.cpp (ACE_Thread_Adapter): Added a new feature that allows
 	  logging features to be inherited by threads.  It works with
 	  those OSs (e.g., Win32) that use ACE_Thread_Adapter class.  At
 	  some point, we might do this for all the OSs.  Thanks to Luca
 	  for this.

	* examples/Connection/misc/Connection_Handler.cpp: Added a
	  new example that illustrates how to use the Acceptor pattern
	  to create multiple threads, each running its own Reactor.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (dump): Some of the variables in the dump()
 	  method have the wrong format specification type. These are:
 	  restart_ (%d), flags_ (%x), priority_mask_ (%d).  They are now
 	  fixed, thanks to Luca.

	* tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp (open): Add an ACE_ASSERT to make
 	  sure that the tasks activate() correctly.  Thanks to David for
 	  finding this.

	* ace/config-linux-lxpthreads.h: Added #defines for
 	  ACE_HAS_AUTOMATIC_INIT_FINI and ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING.
  	  Thanks to Marius for this.

	* ace/Malloc.h: Changed the typedef of ACE_Malloc_Align to a macro
 	  called ACE_MALLOC_ALIGN to allow users to override this value in
 	  their config.h file.  This is necessary for platforms that don't
 	  have "long" word alignments.  Thanks to Fred LaBar
 	  <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for this suggestion.

	* ace/OS.h: Added an #ifdef check for ACE_HAS_IRIX62_THREADS and
 	  if so, we'll use the if (&a) /* null */; } form of the
 	  ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro to avoid unnecessary warnings.  Thanks to
 	  Fred LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for testing this out.

Fri Jan 17 16:33:25 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.*: added elapsed_time () and get_time ().

	* netsvcs/clients/Tokens/collection/collection.cpp, rw_locks.cpp:
	  commented out unused variables to avoid compiler warnings; and
	  return 0 from main ().

	* include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU,
	  netsvcs/lib/Makefile,
	  examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Makefile:
	  fixed ESOBUILD mechanism to work on all platforms, not just Linux.
	  Thanks to Marius Kjeldahl <marius@funcom.com> for this fix.

	* ace/OS.i and OS.cpp: uninlined functions that use varargs, because
	  they usually won't get inlined anyways.

	* ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): added #else clause to be sure that
	  always sparam.sched_priority always get set to the priority argument.

	* netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Client_Test.cpp: commented out
	  unused parameters and wrapped combined assignments/conditional
	  values to avoid compiler (g++) warnings.

	* tests/Priority_Task_Test.cpp: added check for successful thread
	  spawn, and ACE_NEW_THREAD to svc () so that messages get logged.

Thu Jan 16 17:03:47 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude: Added support for shared object files
	  on Linux.  Thanks to Marius Kjeldahl <mariusk@sn.no,
	  marius@funcom.com> for his help with this. 

	* ace: Merged in the IRIX support, mainly the missing netdb reentrant 
	  functions.  Thanks to Gonzalo Diethelm <gonzo@ing.puc.cl>
	  and Carlos O'Ryan <coryan@mat.puc.cl> for their help.

	* ace/Timer_{List,Heap,Queue}: Changed iterator() to iter() to
 	  avoid name clashes with STL (ugh).

	* ace/Timer_{Heap,List}.cpp: Added ACE_BUILD_DLL so that things
 	  will link.  Thanks to John Morey for reporting this.

	* ace/Synch_T.h: Fixed: class ACE_Write_Guard: method:
 	  tryacquire_write so that it will call
 	  ...->lock_->tryacquire_write() and not
 	  ...->lock_->acquire_write().  Thanks to Alexandre Karev
	  <Alexandre.Karev@cern.ch> for this fix.

Thu Jan 16 15:51:16 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* Dump.cpp (register_object): initialized "slot" so that g++ doesn't
	  complain about uninitialized use.

	* Reactor.cpp (initialized): use ACE_GUARD_RETURN instead of
	  ACE_GUARD because the function returns a value;
	  (find): initialize "i" if handle is out of range so that g++
	  doesn't complain about uninitialized use.

	* Service_Repository.cpp (remove): removed unused variable "handle".

	* Thread_Manager.h: made destructor virtual now that spawn_i () is
	  virtual.

	* Timer_Heap.cpp: changed some int loop indicies to size_t to
	  make sure that comparisons are consistently signed or unsigned.

	* OS.h, config-vxworks*.h: removed ACE_HAS_GREENHILLS_SOCKETS
	  ACE macro because the code it wrapped applies to all VxWorks
	  compilers, not just GreenHills.

Wed Jan 15 02:06:21 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ACE.cpp (round_to_pagesize): If _SC_PAGESIZE is enabled then
 	  we set the ACE::pagesize_ variable using sysconf(2).  Thanks to
 	  James Mansion for this suggestion.

Wed Jan 15 02:06:21 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_Queue.cpp (expire): Changed a line of code from
	
	  ACE_Timer_Queue_Iterator &iterator (this->iterator ());

	  to

	  ACE_Timer_Queue_Iterator &iterator = this->iterator ();

	  so that the Visual C++ compiler can grok it.  Thanks to John
 	  Morey for reporting this.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Modified the close() method so that it can be
 	  called multiple times with no bad side-effects.

	* ace/Pipe.cpp: Modified the close() method so that it can be
 	  called multiple times with no bad side-effects.

	* ace/Reactor: Added an initialized() method that indicates
 	  whether the Reactor was successfully initialized.  Also
 	  rearranged the code in ACE_Reactor::open() so that initialized_
 	  is only set at the end of the method when everything succeeds.
  	  If things *don't* succeed, we call close() on the way out.
  	  Thanks to Luca for these suggestions.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (close): When closing down the ACE_Reactor, we
 	  now set initialized_ back to 0 so that it can be reopened again
 	  later.

	* tests/Reader_Writer_Test.cpp: There were some problems with this
 	  test due to the fact that on many pthreads platforms pthread_t
 	  isn't an int (it's a struct).  Thanks to Chuck Gehr
 	  <gehr@sweng.stortek.com> for the fix.

	* ace/OS.i (exit): In WIN32 when the process exits through an
 	  ExitProcess() call, some process resources (e.g., file handles)
 	  are freed before the static variable destructors are
 	  called. This results in an application error when tracing is
 	  enabled.  Removing the ACE_TRACE call in ~ACE_Event_Handler
	  seems to fix this.  Thanks to Luca for this fix.

	* ace/OS: Fixed the implementation of semaphores for the POSIX
 	  port (POSIX lacks semaphores).  The trick was to add a "waiters"
 	  field, along with the semaphore count.  Thanks to John Bossom
 	  <John.Bossom@Cognos.COM> for reporting this.

	* examples/Threads/wfmo.cpp: Added a new test program that seems
 	  to indicate that the Win32 WaitForMultipleObjects() function can
 	  be called in multiple threads, all of which wait on the same set
 	  of HANDLEs.  Note that the dispatching of the threads is
 	  relatively "fair" (i.e., everyone gets a chance to process the
 	  various HANDLEs as they become active).  Thanks to Ari Erev
 	  <Ari_Erev@comverse.com> for suggesting this and providing the
 	  initial code.

	* ace/Thread_Manager.h: Made the spawn_i() method virtual and
 	  moved it into the protected section of the class so that it can
 	  be over-ridden by subclasses.  Thanks to Tim Harrison for
 	  suggesting this.

Tue Jan 14 15:57:55 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Changed the default size of ACE_DEFAULT_TIMERS to
 	  _SC_TIMER_MAX (which is typically around 40 or so).
	  Thanks to Stuart Powell <stuartp@in.ot.com.au> for
	  suggesting this.

	* tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp (main): Added some additional logic
 	  so that we can test the performance of the preallocated and
 	  non-preallocated ACE_Timer_Heap.

	* ace/Timer_Heap: Added a new "preallocate nodes" mechanism to the
 	  ACE_Timer_Heap.  If this is enabled by the constructor, then we
 	  preallocate as many ACE_Timer_Nodes as there are slots in the
 	  heap.  This allows us to completely remove the need for dynamic
 	  memory allocation, which is important for real-time systems.

	* ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (remove_thr): Optimized the code just a
 	  tad by decrementing the current_count_ *first*.  Thanks to Per
 	  Andersson <Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se> for suggesting this.

	* ace/ReactorEx: Updated the implementation so that the
 	  handle_events() method now in fact *does* return the number of
 	  event handler's dispatched (i.e., the implementation matches the
 	  documentation...).  Thanks to Hamutal Yanay
 	  <Hamutal_Yanay@mail.icomverse.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/Service_Repository.cpp (remove): Removed an extra call to
 	  ACE_OS::dlclose().  This is already being called in the
 	  destructor of ACE_Service_Record.  Thanks to Karlheinz for
 	  reporting this.

	* man: Updated all the nroff and html documentation.

	* ace/Timer_Heap: Implemented the spiffy new timer cancellation
 	  algorithm that requires only O(log N) time to remove a timer
 	  from the ACE_Timer_Heap.  This is about 50 to 100 times faster
 	  than using the ACE_Timer_List implementation.

Tue Jan 14 21:01:36 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Replace "Linux" preprocessor symbol with "linux".

Mon Jan 13 17:57:50 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Synch: Added lock() accessor methods to both
 	  ACE_Process_Semaphore and ACE_Process_Mutex.  Thanks to Hamutal
 	  Yanay <Hamutal_Yanay@mail.icomverse.com> for suggesting this.

	* ace/config-mvs.h: Added a #define for ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE.
	  Thanks to Chuck Gehr for this information.

	* ace/LSOCK_Stream.h: Added a new typedef for PEER_ADDR that is
 	  associated with ACE_UNIX_Addr.  Thanks to Mark Rabotnikov
 	  <mark@usp.elscintcorp.co.il> for suggesting this.

Mon Jan 13 22:24:09 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Added #undefs of sigemptyset and sigfillset on Linux
	  when __OPTIMIZE__ is enabled.  Yes, the system header on Linux
	  really #defines them when optimizing!  Thanks to an anonymous
	  ACE user for pointing this out.

	* tests/tests_config.h: Dropped ACE_MAX_ITERATIONS back to 10.

Sun Jan 12 16:59:52 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Timer_List.cpp (schedule): Cleanup the code so that (1)
 	  timer_id never == -1 (in order to distinguish it from error
 	  return values and (2) so that we avoid an unnecessary check for
 	  operator new failure.

	* ace/OS.h: Added a new #define called ACE_DEFAULT_MAX_TIMERS,
 	  which specifies the maximum number of ACE_Event_Handlers
 	  supported by ACE_Timer_Heap.

	* ace/Proactor.cpp (ACE_Proactor): Updated the allocation of
 	  ACE_Timer_Queue so that it really points to an ACE_Timer_List by
 	  default.  Naturally, this can be overridden by users.

	* ace/ReactorEx.cpp (open): Updated the allocation of
 	  ACE_Timer_Queue so that it really points to an ACE_Timer_List by
 	  default.  Naturally, this can be overridden by users.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (open): Updated the allocation of
 	  ACE_Timer_Queue so that it really points to an ACE_Timer_List by
 	  default.  Naturally, this can be overridden by users.

	* ace: Added two new classes called ACE_Timer_List and
 	  ACE_Timer_Heap, which derive from ACE_Timer_Queue.
  	  ACE_Timer_List is essentially the old behavior of
 	  ACE_Timer_Queue, i.e., it uses an implementation of a linked
 	  list of ACE_Timer_Nodes.  ACE_Timer_Heap, on the other hand,
 	  uses a heap-based callout queue, which is more appropriate for
 	  certain real-time applications.

	* ace/Timer_Queue: Revised the ACE_Timer_Queue implementation so
 	  that it's now an abstract base class with most of the
 	  implementation details pushed into the ACE_Timer_List and
 	  ACE_Timer_Heap subclasses.

	* ace/Timer_Queue.h: Made all the ACE_Timer_Queue methods public
 	  so that we can override them in a subclass (e.g., the new
 	  ACE_Timer_Heap).

	* examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp: Fixed this
 	  example application so that it only uses a single Reactor (the
 	  REACTOR::instance()) rather than two Reactors.  Thanks to Sandro
 	  Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting this.

	* netsvcs/lib/Logging_Strategy.cpp: Fixed the #include of
 	  fstream.h and iostream.h to use the '<' '>' notation rather than
 	  the '"' and '"' notation.  This avoids problems with running
 	  "make depend".  Thanks to Rino Simioni <sir@necsy.it> for
 	  reporting this fix.

Sun Jan 12 18:20:49 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ACE.cpp (round_to_pagesize): fixed typo in reference to
	  ACE::pagesize_.

	* ace/ACE.cpp: initialize ACE::pagesize_ to 0.

	* ace/config-irix*.h and config-win*.h: removed ACE_PAGE_SIZE
	  definition because these platforms no longer use it.

	* tests/UNIX*.conf and Win32server.conf:  replaced net_svcs
	  with netsvcs.

Sat Jan 11 15:11:28 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (thr_setprio): The POSIX implementation of
 	  ACE_OS:thr_setprio did not set the priority.  It calls:

	  pthread_setschedparam( thr_id, &policy, &param )
 
          and then does
 
          prio = param.sched_priority.
 
          instead of

	  param.sched_priority = prio;
	  
	  This is now fixed.  Thanks to John Bossom <John.Bossom@Cognos.COM>
	  for reporting this.

	* ace/config-irix*.h: Modified all the IRIX config files to
	  use the new ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE feature since this is necessary 
	  to differentiate between IRIX and IRIX64.
	  Thanks to Fred LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for
	  reporting this.

	* ace/ACE.cpp: Modified the round_to_pagesize() so that if
	  a config.h file enables ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE then we use
	  that function in preference to the value in config.h.
	  Thanks to Fred LaBar <flabar@fallschurch.esys.com> for
	  suggesting this.

	* ace/ACE.cpp: Modified the round_to_pagesize() so that on
 	  platforms that allow the page size to be obtained dynamically
 	  we'll get that rather than replying on what it set in the
 	  config.h file.  We'll cache this value in a static variable
	  to speedup searches.  Thanks to James Mansion for suggesting
	  this.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Finished adding support for thread-safe
 	  reference counting to the uses of ACE_Message_Block.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Peer_Router.cpp: Replaced
 	  the use of ACE_MT_SYNCH with ACE_SYNCH so that this will compile
 	  correctly on non-MT platforms.

Fri Jan 10 12:38:42 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Added a COPYING file that explicitly states the copyright status
 	  of ACE.

	* ace/config-win32-msvc4.x.h and ace/config-winnt-4.0-msvc4.x.h:
 	  By default, we'll revert to *not* enabling
 	  ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS for MSVC++ 4.2, even though this is
 	  well-support by the compiler since it breaks some application
 	  code that expects to use 3 template parameters for
 	  ACE_Svc_Handler<>.  The "fix" is to use the ACE_SOCK_STREAM
 	  macros (rather than using the "ACE_SOCK_Stream, ACE_INET_Addr"
 	  tuple) in order to achieve portability in either case.  Thanks
 	  to Karlheinz for pointing out the need for backwards
 	  compatibility.

Wed Jan  8 01:00:05 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Message_Block_Test.cpp: Enhanced the torture test of the
 	  ACE_Message_Block so that it stresses the reference counting
 	  implementation in a multi-threaded environment.

Wed Jan 08 10:26:45 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (~ACE_Data_Block): assigned 0 to
	  allocator_strategry_ after deleting it; fixed template
	  specializations (for g++) by using macros instead of class names;
	  commented out template specializations because Service_Record.cpp
	  already has them, and they should only appear once in the library
	  in order to avoid link clashes

	* ace/Service_Object.cpp (ACE_Service_Object): reordered
	  initializations in constructor

	* ace/Service_Record.cpp (ACE_Service_Record): reordered
	  initializations in constructor

	* ace/config-linux-lxpthreads.h:  added
	  ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_THR_EXIT_SEMANTICS, thanks to
	  James CE Johnson <jcej@lads.com> for tracking down this
	  problem and testing the fix.

Tue Jan  7 13:03:25 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Message_Block: Continued to improve the
	  ACE_Message_Block/ACE_Data_Block implementation.

	* ace/Message_Block: Added a new constructor to ACE_Message_Block
 	  that takes an ACE_Data_Block * and "owns" it.  Thanks to Tim for
 	  this idea.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Now that we've prevented signal handlers from
 	  occurring within critical sections of ACE_Log_Msg::log() we
 	  don't need to use the ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex anymore.
  	  Instead, we just need ACE_Thread_Mutex.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Added an ACE_Sig_Guard to the block in
 	  ACE_Log_Msg::log() that acquires the mutex that serializes
 	  output.  This prevents nasty problems with recursive to
 	  ACE_Log_Msg::log() from within signal handlers.

	* ace/Service_Config.cpp (end_reactor_event_loop): Added a timeout
 	  of ACE_Time_Value::zero to the ACE_Reactor::notify() method when
 	  called in the ACE_Service_Config::end_reactor_event_loop().
  	  This prevents the Reactor from blocking indefinitely if there's
 	  no longer a thread to receive from the notification pipe.
  
	* netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore: Removed the vestigal
 	  nametest.cpp and nametest.h files.  I'm not sure why they were
 	  still there, but they shouldn't have been!

	* ace/Synch.i (remove): this->owner_ should be set to -1 before
 	  calling this->release().  Thanks to Per Andersson
 	  <Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se> for suggesting this.

	* ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (exit): Added a flag called "do_thr_exit"
 	  to the ACE_Thread_Control::exit() method.  This controls whether
 	  we call ACE_OS::thr_exit() after removing the thread from the
 	  Thread Manager's internal table.  This is necessary to work
 	  around pthread bugs on certain platforms (e.g., AIX and Linux).

	* ace/Synch.h: Removed the
 	  ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex::set_nesting() method since this
 	  isn't being used and is potentially dangerous.  Thanks to Per
 	  Andersson <Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se> for suggesting this.

	* ace/XtReactor: Updated the XtReactor so that it uses the next
 	  internal Reactor implementation.  Thanks to Mark Rabotnikov
 	  <mark@usp.elscintcorp.co.il> for reporting this.

	* ace/Task.i: Updated the grp_id(int) method to cache the group id
 	  in the task and then set it in the Thread_Manager, if there is
 	  one.  Thanks to Hamutal Yanay <Hamutal_Yanay@mail.icomverse.com>
 	  for suggesting this.

	* ace/Log_Record.h: Updated the ACE_Log_Record class to use the
 	  new ACE_MAXLOGMSGLEN macro.

	* ace/OS.h: Added a new #define called ACE_MAXLOGMSGLEN.  By
 	  default this is 4k.  However, you can reset it in the config.h
 	  file if you'd like to increase or decrease the size.  Thanks to
 	  Anthony McConnell for suggesting this.
	  
	* examples/Threads/tss[12].cpp: Tidied up the tss1.cpp and
 	  tss2.cpp examples and improved the comments.  Thanks to Luca for
 	  suggesting this.

	* ace/Service_Object.cpp (fini): Added the "virtual" keyword to
 	  the new destructor of ACE_Service_Type.  Thanks to David for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/Message_Block.i: Rearranged the order of the ACE_Data_Block
 	  and ACE_Message_Block locking_strategy() methods so that they'd
 	  be defined as inline before being used.  Thanks to David for
 	  reporting this.

Mon Jan  6 16:46:06 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Service_Manager.cpp (fini): Only try to remove the
 	  ACE_Service_Manager from the Reactor if it's actually been
 	  registered in the first place (i.e., if it's get_handle() method
 	  does not return ACE_INVALID_HANDLE).

	* netsvcs/servers/svc.conf: Changed the name of the net services
 	  .so file from libnet_svcs to netsvcs so that it will work
 	  correctly with our new "cross-platform" svc.conf ACE::ldfind()
 	  strategy.  Thanks to Marius Kjeldahl <marius@funcom.com> for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (find): Added a strategic break and a check for
 	  handle_in_range().  Thanks to Tim for this help!

	* netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/svc.conf: Removed the "lib" part
 	  from the executable shared object file names in the svc.conf
 	  file so that it will work with the new "cross-platform" svc.conf
 	  ACE::ldfind() strategy.  Thanks to Marius Kjeldahl
 	  <marius@funcom.com> for reporting this.

	* ace/Service_Record.cpp (fini): Added an extra assignment to a
 	  temporary const void *obj to avoid problems with MSVC++ and it's
 	  cast mechanism.

	* ace/ReactorEx.h: Added a default parameter to
 	  ACE_ReactorEx::notify().  Thanks to Tim for noticing this.

	* tests: Added a new test for ACE_Message_Block, which is called
 	  Message_Block_Test.cpp (no surprise there ;-)).  This test
 	  exercises the reference counting mechanisms.

	* ace/Message_Block.h: Made the destructors for ACE_Message_Block
 	  and ACE_Data_Block virtual, so that these classes can be
 	  subclassed and ACE_Message_Blocks can delete these
	  subclasses (either via release() or delete).  Thanks to Tilo
	  Christ for suggesting this.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Modified the implementation
	  of ACE_Message_Block/ACE_Data_Block so that we always create
	  an allocator_strategy_.  By default, this strategy will be
	  ACE_Allocator_Adapter <ACE_Malloc <ACE_Local_Memory_Pool, ACE_Null_Mutex> >;
	  This greatly simplifies the code.

	* ace/Message_Block.h: It's now possible to assign a
 	  Message_Block's priority when you create it.

	* ace/Reactor: Sped things up some more by merging the Reactor's
 	  any_ready() and fill_in_ready() methods together.  This reduces
 	  redundant computations.

	* ace/Reactor: Changed the name of ACE_Reactor::detach() to
 	  ACE_Reactor::remove_handler_i() and changed the name of
 	  ACE_Reactor::attach() to ACE_Reactor::register_handler_i().
  	  This is more consistent with the other naming schemes.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Reworked the implementation of the Handler
 	  Repository's unbind() method in order to simplfy the logic.
  	  Also merged in all the Reactor's detach() functionality into the
 	  unbind() method in order to localize all the handler removal
 	  processing.

	* ace/Reactor[Ex].cpp: Added more descriptive errno entries for
 	  failed operations in the handler repository.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Modified the implementation of the Handler
 	  Repository's bind() method so that it reports an error if you
 	  try to register an Event_Handler for an invalid HANDLE.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Reimplemented the internals of the Reactor to
 	  prepare for the upcoming merge of the Reactor and ReactorEx to
 	  use a single code base.

	* ace/Timer_Queue.cpp: Modified the behavior of the expire()
 	  methods so that they return the number of ACE_Event_Handlers
 	  whose handle_timeout() method was called.

Sat Jan  4 11:47:05 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Reactor.h: Removed the #ifdefs for ACE_HAS_POLL.  This will
 	  be recast as a strategy in subsequent implementations.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Added a new call,
 	  ACE_Handler_Repository::handle_in_range(), which checks to make
 	  sure that the HANDLE is within the range of 0 .. max_handlep1_.
  	  This factors out some redundant code.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp: Sped up the performance of the Reactor by
 	  removing redundant calls to
 	  ACE_Handler_Repository::invalid_handle() and
 	  ACE_Handler_Repository::find().

	* tests/Reactors_Test.cpp: Added a test for
 	  the new Reactor::notify() method with timeouts.

	* examples/Reactor/Misc/notification.cpp (svc): Added a test for
 	  the new Reactor::notify() method with timeouts.

	* ace/Reactor[Ex]: Modified the Reactor and ReactorEx so that they
 	  use timed send() operations for their notify() methods.  This
 	  makes it possible for users to bound the amount of time they're
 	  willing to wait to try and notify the Reactor.  This is mostly
 	  useful to avoid infinite blocking if there is congestion in the
 	  Reactor's notification mechanism.

	* ace/ACE.cpp: Added a new timed send() method that uses the
 	  write() system call on UNIX and the socket send() call on Win32.
  	  This new method is used in the new ACE_Reactor::notify() method,
 	  which now supported timed notifications.

	* ace/Reactor.cpp (ACE_Handler_Repository): To simplify the code
 	  and reduce unnecessary #ifdefs, I've merged the max_handlep1_
 	  and cur_size_ fields (which are now called max_handlep1_).

Fri Jan  3 10:47:15 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace: Replaced all uses of "delete mb" with mb->release ();

	* ace/Stream_Modules.cpp: Replaced the use of explicit bit
	  twiddling with the ACE_BIT* macros.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Make sure that we use the
 	  allocator_strategy_ to create the memory for the reference count
 	  since this may need to go into shared memory if that's the
 	  memory pool where the Message_Block allocations are coming from.

	* ace/OS.h: Added two new macros, ACE_ALLOCATOR_RETURN and
	  ACE_ALLOCATOR, which are similar to ACE_NEW_RETURN and ACE_NEW, 
	  except that these

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (release): Make sure to "delete this"
 	  outside the scope of the locking_strategy_.

	* ace/Service_Object.cpp: Added a destructor to ACE_Service_Type.
  	  Thanks to Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for
 	  suggesting this.

	* ace/Service_Object.i: Be smarter about how we reassign the name_
 	  pointer, i.e., delete the old one and make a copy.  Thanks to
 	  Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Module.cpp (open): Rearranged the assignments to
 	  reader_q->mod_ and writer_q->mod_ so that we don't try to
 	  initialize through NULL pointers.  Thanks to
 	  Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Service_Record.cpp (ACE_Service_Record): Initialized name_
 	  to NULL so that the following change works correctly now.
  	  Thanks to Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/Service_Record.i (name): Make sure to delete [] (char *)
 	  this->name_ before allocating a new one.  Thanks to
 	  Per.Andersson@hfera.ericsson.se (Per Andersson) for reporting
 	  this.

	* ace/Message_Block: Reworked the reference counting implemention
 	  so that reference counts are shared correctly amongst their
 	  various owners.  This requires making a deep copy the "header"
 	  portion, but a shallow copy of the "data."

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Message_Block): Updated all three
 	  ACE_Message_Block constructors so that they all call the init()
 	  method.  This centralizes all the initialization logic in one
 	  place.

Thu Jan  2 00:42:21 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Message_Block): Make sure to set the
 	  cont_ field to 0 after "releasing" it so that we don't
 	  mistakenly think it's still around later on.  This problem arose
 	  in the ACE_Message_Queue::close() method, which was trying to
 	  count the number of bytes being freed.

	* ace/Message_Queue.cpp (close): Fixed a subtle bug where we
 	  weren't actually deleting messages from the
 	  ACE_Message_Queue::close() routine.  This should work now...

	* ace/Message_Queue.cpp (close): Replaced the use of "delete mb"
 	  with "mb->release()" since the Message_Blocks are now reference
 	  counted.  

	* ace/Message_Block: Enhanced the reference counting scheme so
 	  that you can increment and decrement the count by an arbitrary
 	  amount.  This is particular useful when you know you'll be
 	  sending the same Message_Block to N consumers.

	* ace/Singleton: The dump() must be used same as instance()
          (without supplying an object) so it must be declarated *static*,
	  i.e.,

	  static void dump (void);

	  Thanks to Sandro Doro <alex@aureus.sublink.org> for reporting
 	  this.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server: Completely rewrote and retested the
 	  ACE Event Server example.  The new code is *much* easier to
 	  understand, has many more comments, is more robust, and compiles
 	  much faster since I removed many of the templates.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Tranceiver/tranceiver.cpp: Fixed the
 	  tranceiver so that it shuts down correctly when the Event_Server
 	  exits.

	* examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.cpp: Fixed a
 	  problem where we were trying to select() on ACE_STDIN on Win32.
  	  Naturally, this doesn't work, so we used the
 	  ACE::register_stdin_handler() to fix this.  Thanks to
 	  Samuel_Bercovici <Samuel_Bercovici_at_EFT__AD2@mail.icomverse.com>
	  for reporting this.

	* examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Options: Changed the
 	  Options class to be a Singleton...

	* ace/Task.h: Added "const" method qualifier to accessor methods
 	  like is_reader() and is_writer().

Wed Jan  1 00:10:47 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Message_Block: Added a new static release() method that
 	  behaves like the non-static method release(), except that it
 	  checks if <mb> is 0.  This is similar to CORBA::release(), which
 	  is useful if you want to eliminate lots of checks for NULL
 	  pointers before calling release() on them.

	* Updated all places in ACE where we use
 	  ACE_Event_Handler::READ_MASK when we should be using
 	  ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK.

	* examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_Thr_Stream.cpp:
 	  Changed the name of the acceptor class from Handle_Thr_Stream to
 	  Handle_Thr_Acceptor, which is more accurate.

	* ace/Reactor: Since we've now got an
 	  ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK (intended primarily to accept
 	  connections asynchronously using Win32 overlapped I/O) we can
 	  now use this with the ACE_Reactor, as well.  In particular, any
 	  time that we are registering a "passive-mode" socket acceptor we
 	  can now specify ACE_Event_Handler::ACCEPT_MASK.  This is much
 	  more intuitive than using the READ_MASK (which never made any
 	  sense...).  The ACE_Reactor now treats the ACCEPT_MASK as a
 	  READ_MASK internally, so you can still use READ_MASK if you'd
 	  like (i.e., this change doesn't break any existing code).

	* ace/Event_Handler: Changed "get_priority" and "set_priority" to
 	  simply "priority(void)" and "priority(int)" to be more
 	  consistent with other parts of ACE.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Updated the Gateway so that the
	  concurrency strategies can now be specified on the
	  command-line (or in the svc.conf file), rather than being
	  determined at compile-time.  This is much more flexible.
	  See the ./apps/Gateway/Gateway/README file for details.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Verified that all the multi-threading
 	  strategies still work.

	* ace/Message_Block.cpp (ACE_Message_Block): Make sure that we
 	  "release" the continuation field, rather than delete it, since
 	  its reference count may be > 1.

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Change the abort_prog logic a bit so that
 	  we always print a message to stderr if we're exiting,
 	  regardless...  Thanks to David Levine for pointing this out.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Moved all of the configuration file
 	  parsing logic *outside* of the Event_Channel into the Gateway
 	  class so that we wouldn't have unnecessary dependencies.

	* apps/Gateway/Gateway: Redesigned the Gateway so that the
 	  Proxy_Handlers (i.e., the Consumer_Proxy and Supplier_Proxy)
 	  most of their work to the Event_Channel.  This "lightweight
 	  proxy" design is an improvement since it is now possible to
 	  emulate the COS Event Channel semantics within the Event_Channel
 	  "kernel."

	* Happy new year!  Let's start a new ChangeLog to celebrate the
	  new year.
