	* src/*, tests/*, netsvcs/*: Implemented major changes to the
	  package system.  Now all files descend from the JACE directory
	  under the main archive level.  All files are further grouped by
	  their subpackage names.  This is the way Java usually wants it,
	  and makes JACE javadoc friendly.

	  Rewrote and added javadoc comments throughout JACE.

	  Changed all concurrency mechanisms to inherit from AbstractLock,
	  obeying all its requirements such as not releasing the lock
	  unless the accessing thread is the owner.

	  Added the token service.

	  Added and rewrote tests for Concurrency mechs and ServiceConfig.

	  Rewrote network services to inherit from JACE.netsvcs.Server and
	  JACE.netsvcs.Handler, abstracting much of the work out to these
	  base classes.

	  Debugging is now OFF by default.

	* src/GetOpt.java: Added another constructor to GetOpt with an
	  option to return args even if not in the optstring.  This is
	  useful for the default case in a switch (for printUsage
	  and exit).

Wed Aug 18 13:35:46 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/TimerQueue.java: Now when createInternalThread is specified
	  in the constructor, it is set to be a daemon thread.  Thus, if a
	  TimerQueue thread is the only one executing, the VM exits.

	* src/StrategyAcceptor.java, AcceptStrategy.java
	  StrategyAcceptor now inherits from Acceptor.  AcceptStrategy
	  can now delegate to an Acceptor, rather than having its own
	  SOCKAcceptor.  Its default is to delegate to a generic
	  Acceptor instance (that uses a SOCKAcceptor).

	* src/Acceptor.java, TimeValue.java
	  Solved a few javadoc warnings.

Fri Jul 09 11:08:32 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/TimedWait.java, Stream*.java, Token.java
	  Fixed a bug in TimedWait from the recent changes.  Made
	  Streams (and Modules) use absolute times for timeouts.

Thu Jul 08 14:54:36 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/Condition.java, TimedWait.java, EventHandler.java, 
	  MessageQueue.java, ServiceObject.java, SvcHandler.java,
	  Task.java, Mutex.java, Semaphore.java, Token.java, 
	  TimerQueue.java

	  Changed the semantics of Condition, TimedWait, MessageQueue,
	  Task, Mutex, Semaphore, and Token to use absolute times for
	  their timeouts.

	  Changed the semantics of EventHandler, ServiceObject, and
	  SvcHandler such that handleTimeout receives a TimeValue
	  representing when the event occured.

	  Changed TimerQueue internally to reflect the above changes.

	  Also made better checks in Token and Mutex so that non-owners
	  can call release without adverse effects.  I plan to try to
	  do this with Semaphore and RWMutex as well.

Thu Jul 08 11:20:17 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/TimeValue.java: Added relativeTimeOfDay(offsets) 
	  methods which return TimeValues.  These should help people 
	  since many classes will be changed to use
	  absolute TimeValues shortly to correspond to ACE's versions.

Wed Jul 07 22:42:27 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/Token.java: Fixed several bugs in tryacquire and renew.
	Specifying a null TimeValue in acquire or renew now means to wait
	until the lock is obtained.  Specifying TimeValue.zero in acquire
	means just to poll and don't call sleepHook().  In renew, it is
	the same as specifying a requePosition of 0 -- doesn't give up
	the token.

Wed Jul 07 21:54:35 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/TimedWait.java: Fixed the semantics of
	  timedWait(TimeValue tv).  Now when tv represents zero, it has 
	  polling semantics, checking the condition once and returning
	  on success or throwing a TimeoutException on failure.  Before,
	  it blocked until notified.  (Also affects synch mechanisms)

Reset the ChangeLog file for future users.  If anyone wants more complete
file by file changes, they can be provided with the CVS log command.  

Updated the JACE page at http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~eea1/JACE.html to reflect
the Version 1.4.4 changes, which included:

* Removed CUP and JLex from JACE.  The java_cup directory is still in CVS,
  but won't be included in future versions.  This means that the option to
  load C++ ACE ServiceConfigurator files is gone.

* Changed the SOCKStream system so it uses DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
  to maintain compatibility with other languages and remove the deprecation
  warnings from using PrintStream.  (Can't use Reader/Writers since they
  write 16-bit chars not 8-bit bytes)

* Made lots of modifications to comments and code to remove javadoc warnings
  and deprecation warnings.  They were all straight-forward changes such as
  making sure a @throws line was in the comments for all exceptions a method
  had, etc.
