Reset the ChangeLog file for future users.  If anyone wants more complete
file by file changes, they can be provided with the CVS log command.  

Updated the JACE page at http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~eea1/JACE.html to reflect
the Version 1.4.4 changes, which included:

* Removed CUP and JLex from JACE.  The java_cup directory is still in CVS,
  but won't be included in future versions.  This means that the option to
  load C++ ACE ServiceConfigurator files is gone.

* Changed the SOCKStream system so it uses DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
  to maintain compatibility with other languages and remove the deprecation
  warnings from using PrintStream.  (Can't use Reader/Writers since they
  write 16-bit chars not 8-bit bytes)

* Made lots of modifications to comments and code to remove javadoc warnings
  and deprecation warnings.  They were all straight-forward changes such as
  making sure a @throws line was in the comments for all exceptions a method
  had, etc.
