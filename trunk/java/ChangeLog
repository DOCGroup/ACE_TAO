	* src/TimedWait.java, Stream*.java, Token.java
	  Fixed a bug in TimedWait from the recent changes.  Made
	  Streams (and Modules) use absolute times for timeouts.
	  Changed Tokens slightly so that it ignores interrupts --
	  will probably change all synchronization mechanisms to
	  do the same, as well as add a common base class.

	* src/Condition.java, TimedWait.java, EventHandler.java, 
	  MessageQueue.java, ServiceObject.java, SvcHandler.java,
	  Task.java, Mutex.java, Semaphore.java, Token.java, 
	  TimerQueue.java

	  Changed the semantics of Condition, TimedWait, MessageQueue,
	  Task, Mutex, Semaphore, and Token to use absolute times for
	  their timeouts.

	  Changed the semantics of EventHandler, ServiceObject, and
	  SvcHandler such that handleTimeout receives a TimeValue
	  representing when the event occured.

	  Changed TimerQueue internally to reflect the above changes.

	  Also made better checks in Token and Mutex so that non-owners
	  can call release without adverse effects.  I plan to try to
	  do this with Semaphore and RWMutex as well.

	* src/TimeValue.java: Added relativeTimeOfDay(offsets) 
	  methods which return TimeValues.  These should help people 
	  since many classes will be changed to use
	  absolute TimeValues shortly to correspond to ACE's versions.

	* src/Token.java: Fixed several bugs in tryacquire and renew.
	Specifying a null TimeValue in acquire or renew now means to wait
	until the lock is obtained.  Specifying TimeValue.zero in acquire
	means just to poll and don't call sleepHook().  In renew, it is
	the same as specifying a requePosition of 0 -- doesn't give up
	the token.

Wed Jul 07 21:54:35 1999  Everett Anderson  <eea1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/TimedWait.java: Fixed the semantics of
	  timedWait(TimeValue tv).  Now when tv represents zero, it has 
	  polling semantics, checking the condition once and returning
	  on success or throwing a TimeoutException on failure.  Before,
	  it blocked until notified.  (Also affects synch mechanisms)

Reset the ChangeLog file for future users.  If anyone wants more complete
file by file changes, they can be provided with the CVS log command.  

Updated the JACE page at http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~eea1/JACE.html to reflect
the Version 1.4.4 changes, which included:

* Removed CUP and JLex from JACE.  The java_cup directory is still in CVS,
  but won't be included in future versions.  This means that the option to
  load C++ ACE ServiceConfigurator files is gone.

* Changed the SOCKStream system so it uses DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
  to maintain compatibility with other languages and remove the deprecation
  warnings from using PrintStream.  (Can't use Reader/Writers since they
  write 16-bit chars not 8-bit bytes)

* Made lots of modifications to comments and code to remove javadoc warnings
  and deprecation warnings.  They were all straight-forward changes such as
  making sure a @throws line was in the comments for all exceptions a method
  had, etc.
