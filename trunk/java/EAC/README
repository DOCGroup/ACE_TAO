This directory contains the source code for the Event Analysis Configurator (EAC).
The EAC was built as a final project for an Advanced User Interface (CS 501) course,
taught by Dr. Kimura in the fall of 2000.

There are also two MS-Word documents which were written as part of the project.
Hopefully these will explain what the EAC is, what it does, and how it works.
