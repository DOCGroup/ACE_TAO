BASICS

This directory contains both the client (LoggingClient.java) and the
server (SimpleLogger.java).  To compile, use GNU make with no specific
target.

To execute, use "java <classname>" where <classname> is from the
following table:

	Application		<classname>
	===========================================
	client			LoggingClient
	server			SimpleLogger

KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

Interoperability between the C++ client and the Java server
implementation is fine.  However, interoperability between the C++
server and the Java client doesn't work right now.  I believek that
it's due to the C++ server taking a naive approach and expecting to be
able to read an entire C/C++ structure at once, and the Java client
can't support that.  Thus, the only "fix" I can envision is to rework
the C++ server.
