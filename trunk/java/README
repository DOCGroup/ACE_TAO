Java ACE Version 1.5

JACE is compatible with Java 1.1 and higher.

Directory information:

JACE/     All main, network service, and test source files

classes/  Output directory for all the .class files.  This may
          need to be added to your classpath.

doc/      If you generate the javadoc documentation, it will be
          placed here.  Requires javadoc 1.2 or later.  I think
          1.2.2 is the first version that correctly "inherits"
          comments.

Notes on building Java ACE:

UNIX:

Use GNU make on the Makefile in the JACE subdirectory.  That will
build the main and network service sources.  To build the tests,
use the Makefile in the JACE/tests subdirectory.

Generate the javadoc documentation with the command "make doc" with
the Makefile in the JACE subdirectory.

Windows:

Visual J++ 6.0 solution and project files are provided.  The main
JACE solution file compiles all the source files (main, network
service, and test).  The solutions and projects are in
MSVJProjects.zip.

If you don't have VJ++ and are using the JDK from the command line,
you can compile JACE with the batch files in makebat.zip in the JACE
subdirectory.

Generate the javadoc documentation with the makedoc.bat file (also
in makebat.zip).
