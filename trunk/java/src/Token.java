 * <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
 *<blockquote>
 *     Class that acquires, renews, and releases a synchronization
 *     token that is serviced in strict FIFO ordering.
 *
 *</blockquote>
 *
 * <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
 *<blockquote>
 *     This is a general-purpose synchronization mechanism that offers
 *     several benefits. For example, it implements "recursive mutex"
 *     semantics, where a thread that owns the token can reacquire it
 *     without deadlocking.  In addition, threads that are blocked
 *     awaiting the token are serviced in strict FIFO order as other
 *     threads release the token. The solution makes use of the
 *     Specific Notification pattern presented by Tom Cargill in
 *     "Specific Notification for Java Thread Synchronization," PLoP96.
