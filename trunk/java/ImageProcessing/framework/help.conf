Overview
--------

MedJava is a prototype of a large scale distributed medical imaging
system.  It has been developed using Java, in particular, several
components of Java ACE.

Here are the key features of the MedJava toolkit:

* Images can be both downloaded and uploaded across the network.
* Images can be uploaded to Web servers that support HTTP PUT
  functionality (for example, JAWS).
* The tool contains more than a dozen image filters to do image
  processing.
* The image filters can be configured into the system dynamically
  using the Service Configurator pattern.

Please send comments/suggestions to Prashant Jain (pjain@cs.wustl.edu).

Getting Started

MedJava applet can be configured with several (optional) parameters
via the HTML file from which the applet is invoked.  Here is a list of
the parameters:

Menu
----

o Open URL

  Allows user to specify a URL.  If the URL points to an image that is
  readable, then the image is downloaded and displayed in the view
  panel.  

  If the URL points to a directory that is readable then a window
  appears displaying a list of files in that directory.  The user can
  then click on an image file in this window to fetch an image. 

  IMPORTANT NOTE: If the URL points to a directory, the directory must
		  not contain an "index.html" file! If it does, the
		  query will fail and no list of files will appear.

o Save

  Allows user to specify a URL to save the currently loaded image to.
  All images are saved in GIF format.  Note that saving/uploading a
  file can take a while depending upon the size of the image.  This is
  because, the tool first generates the GIF format and then sends the
  bytes across the network.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: The Web server must support image uploading, that is
		  HTTP PUT functionality. Also, due to applet
		  restrictions, the server MUST be running on the same
		  host from which the applet was downloaded from.

o Reset

  Resets the image to the original.  Note that the effects of any
  filters that were applied to the image will be lost.

o Reload Filters

  Reads the filter configuration file again and reloads all the image
  filters.  Note that this serves as the trigger of the Service
  Configurator pattern allowing the tool to reconfigure based on new
  configuration information.

  The filters are specified in filter.conf.  To add/remove filters,
  change this file and then select "Reload Filters".

  To specify a different configuration file, please see "Getting Started".

o Zoom In

  Zooms in to the currently displayed image.  Note that the applet only
  allows to zoom in 4 x times.

o Zoom Out

  Zooms out of the currently displayed image.  Note that the applet
  only allows to zoom out 1/4 x times.

o Apply

  Apply the currently selected filter.  By default no filter is
  selected.  Note that applying a filter to an image can taken
  anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes depending upon the
  image size, the filter type, and the speed of the machine on which
  the applet is running.

o Filters:

  Allows the user to select a filter from the ones that have been
  configured into the applet.  Note that this is a choice menu and its
  entries depend upon the filters that were specified in the filter
  configuration file.

  For more information, on how to specify the filters, please see
  "Getting Started".

o About

  Displays the "About" dialog containing the version of the MedJava
  applet.

o Help

  Displays this window
