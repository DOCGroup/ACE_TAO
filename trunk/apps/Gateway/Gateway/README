This application illustrates an application-level Gateway which
routes messages between a set of Peers in a distributed environment.

The default configuration is single-threaded, i.e., all Input_Channels
and Output_Channels are multiplexed via the Reactor on a single thread
of control.  To obtain a version that multi-threads both input and
output simply set the following flag in the Makefile:

DEFFLAGS += -DUSE_OUTPUT_MT -DUSE_INPUT_MT

To get a version that uses single-threading for all Input_Channels,
but a separate thread per-Output_Channel set the following flag in the
Makefile:

DEFFLAGS += -DUSE_OUTPUT_MT 

If you examine the source code, you'll see that very few changes are
required in the source code to switch between single-threading and
multi-threading.  The ACE Task class is primarily responsible for
enabling the flexible modification of concurrency strategies with
little modification to the source code, design, and system
architecture.
