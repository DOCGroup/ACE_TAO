# Configuration file for specifying connection information about
# proxies. 
# 
# Here's an explanation of the fields in this file, and how they
# relate to fields in the "consumer_config" file.
#
# 1. Proxy ID -- Each Proxy is given a unique ID that is used
#    in the "consumer_config" file to specify to which Consumers
#    the Event Channel will forward incoming events from Suppliers.
#    The Proxy ID field is the "key" that is used to match up Proxy
#    connections in this file with the Consumer subscription requests
#    in the "consumer_config" file.
#
# 2. Host -- The host name where the Supplier/Consumer peerd
#    process is running.
#
# 3. Remote Port -- The port number where the remote
#    Supplier/Consumer peerd process is listening on.
#
# 4. Proxy Role -- i.e., Consumer ('C') or Supplier ('S')
#
# 5. Max Retry Timeout -- The maximum amount of time that we'll
#    wait between retry attempts (these start at 1 second and 
#    double until they reach the Max Retry Timeout).
#
# 6. Local Port -- The port number that we want to use for
#    our local Proxy connection.  If this is the value 0, then
#    we'll let the socket implementation pick this value for us.
#
# 7. Priority -- Each Consumer/Supplier can be given a priority
#    that will determine its importance relative to other 
#    Consumers/Suppliers (this feature isn't implemented yet).
