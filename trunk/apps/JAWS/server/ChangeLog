	* JAWS_Tilde.{h,cpp}: This class is being implemented but has not
	  been added to the repository yet, since JAWS as yet does not use
	  it, and it is still being developed.  This will be a cache of
	  the expansions from ~foo to the home directory of foo.

	* JAWS_File.{h,cpp}: New class created to replace the old kludgy
 	  VFS thingy.  This new cached virtual filesystem is way cool: a
 	  file which is being retrieved can be simultaneously replaced
 	  without causing either reader or writer to wait.  Reference
 	  counts are maintained now, which was missing in VFS.  Also,
 	  there is no longer a dependency on the JXH_List template now,
 	  which is a plus.
  	
	* IO.cpp: Changes to adapt to the new virtual filesystem.  The
	  changes all involved simplifications to the programming
	  interface.

	* HTTP_Handler.cpp: Changes required to deal with the more
	  generic error responses returned from the JAWS_File/JAWS_IO
	  interface.  This generality will make it easier to adapt
	  JAWS_File and JAWS_IO into ACE.

	* test_JAWS_File.cpp: A test program written to see if the new
	  virtual filesystem works the way I expect it to.
