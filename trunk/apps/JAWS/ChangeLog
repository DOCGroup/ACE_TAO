Fri Jul 11 02:15:12 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* server/IO.cpp (JAWS_Synch_IO::transmit_file): Changed to use
	  writev () instead of multiple send ()s.

Thu Jul 10 01:53:48 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* server/HTTP_Helpers.{h,cpp}: Changed so that creating the date
	  header is less expensive.

	* server/HTTP_Response.cpp: Changes to match above.

	* clients/Caching/README: Added to the repository.

	* clients/Caching/http_handler.{h,cpp}: Added some comments to the
	  code.  Also, moved the code to check to see if the file is in
	  cache already into the connector, so that a connect is not
	  done if the file is cached.  This required a filename ()
	  accessor method to be added to the handler.

Wed Jul  9 13:08:00 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* clients/Caching/http_handler.cpp (svc): Added code to check to
	  see if the file is already cached before trying to cache it.

	* clients/Caching/http_client.cpp (main): Added a comment block at
	  the top of the file.

	* server/HTTP_Handler.cpp and IO.cpp: Changes that were needed
	  since JAWS_File is now integrated into ACE (as ACE_Filecache).

	* server/HTTP_Server.*: Attempting to track down memory leak.
	  This code may be in a state a flux for the next week or so.

Mon Jul  7 23:40:13 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

	* clients/WebSTONE/src/webclient.c: Removed a bunch of THREAD
	  storage class decorators from function makeload() because auto
 	  variables can't be declared as TSS.  Also #ifdef random number
 	  generation code so it uses rand_r on Solaris() and rand() on NT.

	* clients/WebSTONE/src/rexec.c: Modified prototypes for
	  PassOutputThread() and PassErrorThread() to avoid warnings from
	  MSVC.  Still need more refinement on this one. ;(

	* clients/WebSTONE/src/webmaster.c: Added prototype for
	  HostEntCpy() and a null statement to avoid warning from MSVC.

	* clients/WebSTONE/src/gendata/genrand.mak: 
	* clients/WebSTONE/src/master/webmaster.mak:
	* clients/WebSTONE/src/client/webclient.mak: Updated file paths
	  and dependencies.

Sat Jul  5 14:19:20 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Renamed the client directory "clients" to reflect the fact that
 	  we've got multiple client tests now.  Also, moved the original
 	  contents of the client directory into a new clients/Blobby
 	  directory and added Caching and WebSTONE.

	* Moved the ChangeLog from the ./server directory into the ./JAWS
 	  directory since we want to apply ChangeLog entries to all
 	  aspects of JAWS, not just the server.

	* HTTP_Server.cpp (open): Added THR_DETACHED as a flag to
 	  activate().  This should prevent a memory leak that was
 	  occurring since no thread was ever "joining" the threads that
 	  were spawned.

Thu Jul  3 23:33:47 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Response.cpp (~HTTP_Response): changed delete to delete [],
	  removing a major memory leak from JAWS.  Still to find is a
	  memory lead associated with thread per request.  Nanbor's fix is
	  about what I did to EMPTY_HEADER too.

	* JAWS_File.cpp: David points out I need to add specializations
	  for the GNU C++ compiler.

Thu Jul  3 22:38:04 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Response.cpp (build_headers): Added explicit cast for
 	  EMPTY_HEADER from (const char *) to (char *) in order to make
 	  MSVC happy.  This is probably very badly styled.  But
 	  HTTP_HEADER is only used in places that require (const char *),
 	  so I think it's safe to do so.

Thu Jul  3 15:34:30 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Response.cpp (HTTP_Response): Moved a call to delete out of
	  constructor into the destructor where it belongs.

Thu Jul  3 12:28:44 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@lindy.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Parse_Headers.cpp: Line 137, Changed pt to ptr (it was a typo)

Wed Jul  2 22:33:52 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.{h,cpp}: Fixed deadlock bug, since RW_MUTEX's are not
	  recursive (drat!).

Wed Jul  2 21:03:12 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Made a major pass through all the code and made the style
	  consistent with that found in ACE.

Wed Jul  2 14:33:27 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.cpp: Added double check locking pattern to the fetch
	  routine of the virtual filesystem.  This slows things down
	  considerably for files which change frequently and for cache
	  misses in general, but it should be correct.

Wed Jul  2 14:59:29 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Helpers.cpp (HTTP_decode_string): Added cast from strtol to
 	  char explicitly to prevent NT from complaining.

Wed Jul  2 14:33:27 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.{h.cpp}: Modifications to support RW_MUTEX for both
	  the virtual filesystem and the low level ACE_File.  Next major
	  change will be to re-implement the virtual filesystem to use a
	  hash table ala ACE_Hash_Map_Manager.

Wed Jul  2 00:23:22 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Server.{h,cpp}: Changed parsing of options to use
	  mnemonic names rather than numbers.  Added a new thread
	  strategy, THROTTLE.  This is thread-per-request until some
	  maximum number.  Unfortunately, it does not become thread-pool
	  at this point... yet :-).  Added a new option to pass in a
	  backlog value.

	* svc.conf: adjusted to account for the changed options.

	* README: changed to explain new svc.conf options.

	* JAWS_File.cpp: Changed it so that when the file is added to the
	  cache, it is also acquired.  When it is removed from the cache,
	  it is released.  This is so that the reference count is at least
	  one while the file is in the cache.  Also, fixed the virtual
	  filesystem by giving it a simple replacement strategy if the
	  table is full.  For now, it will replace the largest file in the
	  cache with the request for the current file.

Tue Jul  1 19:13:44 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.cpp (JAWS_File): Changes the creation method of a
 	  cached copy from using plain file copy to using mmap and memcpy.
  	  This avoid the extra complexity caused by FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED.

Sat Jun 28 11:55:38 1997  James C Hu <jxh@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Handler.cpp (open): fixed a typo

	* HTTP_Handler.cpp (cgi): fixed a bug, strdup fails on NULL

Sat Jun 28 16:14:38 1997  Sumedh Mungee  <sumedh@cumbia.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Handler.cpp (open): Changed socket send-buffer to 64k

Wed Jun 25 01:11:50 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@dingo.wolfpack.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.cpp: Removed initialization of vfs_ (see below) and
	  changed all references of vfs_ to
	  JAWS_Virtual_Filesystem::instance ().  Thanks to Detlef Becker
	  <detlef.becker@med.siemens.de> for pointing this out.
	  (init): Added initialization of reference_count_ to 0.

	* JAWS_File.h: Removed private member JAWS_Virtual_Filesystem vfs_
	  since JAWS_Virtual_Filesystem is a singleton already.  Caching
	  it doesn't seem to win much and depends on the order of static
	  variables initialization, which is non-portable.

Fri Jun 13 02:42:39 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@dingo.wolfpack.cs.wustl.edu>

	* jaws.{mdp,mak}: Updated to incoporate latest changes.

Thu Jun  5 14:13:22 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Server.cpp: Added more informative comments to the
	  asynch_thread_pool() method due to comments posed by Mehul
	  (MehulM@spa-marketing.com).

Wed Jun  4 23:00:47 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.cpp (JAWS_File): Fixed a bug where JAWS_File wanted
	  the file to have write permissions before openning it.  This is
	  now only true if the file is to be written to.

Wed Jun  4 22:30:41 1997  Nanbor Wang  <nw1@dingo.wolfpack.cs.wustl.edu>

	* main.cpp (main): Changed SIGCLD to SIGCHLD for better
	  portability.

	* IO.cpp (transmit_file): The third argument passed
	  ACE_Asynch_Transmit_File::Header_And_Trailer() should be an
	  address (&).  

Mon Jun  2 16:35:18 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Helpers.cpp: Serious bug in base64 decoder routine
 	  squashed.  Didn't initialize an array with 0's.  The original
 	  source had them declared static.  Also, changed sizeof alphabet_
 	  to strlen (alphabet_), because original code had alphabet_ as an
 	  array, but my translation has alphabet_ as a pointer.

	* HTTP_Response.cpp: Added some code to check to see if the
 	  decoder returns 0.  If it does, flag this as a failed
 	  authorization attempt.

	* HTTP_Handler.cpp: Added a "\r\n" to the confirmation message in
	  receive_file_complete () method.

	* HTTP_Request.cpp: In parse_request_line (), created conditional
	  expressions in the debugging print statement so that a null
	  string will not cause the server to crash.

	* HTTP_Response.cpp:
	  (1) cgi_resposnse () no longer has to wait for the process to
	  die.  The fix to ACE_Process of closing down child handles was
	  enough to get the connection to die on its own.
	  (2) Mike (mrm@cisco.com) pointed out that the output for CGI
	  responses was not create.  The fix was to output a small header
	  before execing the CGI program.

	* test.cgi: a sample cgi program to use when testing the JAWS
	  server.

Sat May 31 13:34:14 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* *.h, *.cpp: Changed include lines from "apps/JAWS/server/..." to
	  "..." to avoid dependencies on the WRAPPER_ROOT tree.

	* jaws.auth:  This file is added to be a sample authorization
	  file.  This is the file which JAWS is currently hardcoded to use
	  to verify authenticated PUT requests.

	* HTTP_Response.cpp:  Added code to normal_response () and to
	  error_response () to better handle authentication.  Now, all PUT
	  methods are required to be authenticated.  The strategy now is
	  very simple, there is only one authorization file and only one
	  realm of authorization.  This will be easy to bring up to spec
	  later, though.

	* HTTP_Helpers.h:  Added alphabet_ data member for the
	  decode/encode base64 methods.

	* HTTP_Helpers.cpp:  Added HTTP_decode_base64 and
	  HTTP_encode_base64 methods.  HTTP_encode_base64 is currently not
	  used, but HTTP_decode_base64 is being used for Basic
	  authentication.

	* *.h, *.cpp: Changed include lines from "JAWS/server/..." to
	  "apps/JAWS/server/..." to fix an error reported by Rob Payne
	  <repayne@jeeves.net>.  This was really due to a bug in the
	  platform_macros.GNU file not adding INCLDIRS to the CCFLAGS
	  during compilation, but in the case other platforms have the
	  same problem, changing the source is a better fix.

Fri May 30 23:19:03 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* README: updated to better reflect the status of JAWS.

	* main.cpp (handler): Added a signal handler for SIGINT, and also
	  set SIG_IGN for SIGCLD.  The first handler calls exit (0) if
	  SIGINT is received, so that static destructors are called.  The
	  second is so that zombies are not formed.

	* HTTP_Response.cpp (cgi_response): Debugging.  (1) The CGI
	  program spewed output on the server side instead of the client.
	  (2) The CGI program had environment variable being set even
	  though there was no associated value.  (3) The client connection
	  was not being closed after the CGI program executed.  Problem
	  (1) was fixed by using set_handles () in cgi_options.  Problem
	  (2) was fixed by testing to see if the header had an associated
	  value before assigning it to the environment.  Problem (3) was
	  fixed by sending an empty confirmation message after waiting for
	  the CGI process to exit.

	* HTTP_Request.cpp (cgi): Debugging.  It was not looking for a
	  ".cgi" extension during the stage of determining if a URI is a
	  CGI script.  This will later be fixed when a full mime-type
	  facility is implemented.

Fri May 23 00:45:24 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS/server: Debugged HTTP/0.9 GET requests, and HTTP/1.0 PUT
	  requests.  Both work now, with minor problems: e.g. the
	  Content-type header doesn't really work (always sends text/html
	  as the content type).  What it should do is see if the request
	  included a content type header, and use it, otherwise, resort to
	  some file suffix and mimetype matching algorithm.

	* Parse_Headers.h (complete_header_line): Added comments
	  explaining the new return values of -1, 0 and 1 (see comments
	  for Parse_Headers.cpp below).

	* Parse_Headers.cpp (complete_header_line): modified so that it
	  returns three values instead of two.  -1 means that an end of
	  line was encountered, but nothing after it yet to verify if it
	  is really a complete header line.  0 means the read cut off in
	  the middle of a line (no end of line character found).  1 means
	  the line is verified to be a complete header line.

	* HTTP_Request.cpp (parse_request): Changed the test so that an
	  HTTP/0.9 request would be sent immediately after being issued.
	  This involved changes to Parse_Headers.

	* JAWS_File.cpp (acquire): Changes involved adding some debugging
	  statements to understand why PUT was not working.  Discovered a
	  bug in how ACE_Mem_Map was being used.

	* HTTP_Request.cpp (content_length): Changed to extract value from
	  the headers, if available.

Thu May 22 16:22:03 1997  James C. Hu  <jxh@pride.cs.wustl.edu>

	* HTTP_Request.cpp (cgi_env): Added a cast so that a warning
	  generated by SGI C++ compiler goes away.

	* Makefile: Reordered the way the files are compiled/linked so
	  that useless warnings about object files not resolving any
	  symbols go away.

Wed May 21 15:33:33 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.{h,cpp}: Added some comments.  Will add a copy ()
	  method soon, after I move my workspace over to lambada.

	* JAWS_Tilde.{h,cpp}: This class is being implemented but has not
	  been added to the repository yet, since JAWS as yet does not use
	  it, and it is still being developed.  This will be a cache of
	  the expansions from ~foo to the home directory of foo.

Tue May 20 22:49:24 1997  James C Hu  <jxh@polka.cs.wustl.edu>

	* JAWS_File.{h,cpp}: New class created to replace the old kludgy
 	  VFS thingy.  This new cached virtual filesystem is way cool: a
 	  file which is being retrieved can be simultaneously replaced
 	  without causing either reader or writer to wait.  Reference
 	  counts are maintained now, which was missing in VFS.  Also,
 	  there is no longer a dependency on the JXH_List template now,
 	  which is a plus.
  	
	* IO.cpp: Changes to adapt to the new virtual filesystem.  The
	  changes all involved simplifications to the programming
	  interface.

	* HTTP_Handler.cpp: Changes required to deal with the more
	  generic error responses returned from the JAWS_File/JAWS_IO
	  interface.  This generality will make it easier to adapt
	  JAWS_File and JAWS_IO into ACE.

	* test_JAWS_File.cpp: A test program written to see if the new
	  virtual filesystem works the way I expect it to.
