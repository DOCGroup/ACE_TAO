To use the http_tester, you need to use a config file, which consists
of a list of experiments, one on each line.

Each experiment (line) consists of several space-delimited compulsory
fields, as follows:

experiment_id (string)
total_number_of_requests (integer)
request_rate (float)
url1 (first URL)
p1 (probability of requesting the first URL)
url2 (second URL)
p2 (probability of requesting the second URL)
url3 (third URL)
p3 (probability of requesting the third URL)
TCP_NODELAY (boolean, 1 == TCP_NODELAY is set)
SOCKET_RECV_BUFSIZ (usually 65536)

URLS must be of the form:

http://www.cs.wustl.edu:8888/~sumedh/index.html

(the port number is required, im making it optional in the next version).

Please see the sample file "config", for an example.
