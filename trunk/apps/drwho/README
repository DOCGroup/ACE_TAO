This directory contains the "distributed rwho" (drwho) program.  Drwho
alleviates certain rwho(1) limitations.  For instance it adds
functionality that spans subnets.  In addition, drwho prints a much
more concise listing of who's logged in around a network.

Below are some examples of how to use drwho.  If you'd like to find
out who's logged in around here, try the following commands:

1. Print out the command-line options.

% drwho-client -h
usage: ./drwho-client 
-?      prints a short usage message
-A      append the following hostname to the list of predefined hostnames.
-a      return information on *all* users remotely logged in (uses yp passwd).
-b      run the server in the background (i.e., as a daemon).
-d      turn on debugging.
-F      use the following file contents to initialize the host list.
-f      use the following file contents to initialize the friends database.
-H      use the following hostname as part of the new list of hostnames.
        (this option overwrites the existing default names).
-h      print a long usage message.
-L      print the login name rather than the real name (which is the default).
-l      print information in long format (works for all protocols).
-p      set the port number (server must correspond).
-r      do the remote lookups (i.e., local operations are the default).
-R      print info using the rusers format.
-s      sort the output by login name.
-S      sort the output by real name.
-t      set the amount of time we wait for servers to timeout.
-w      return information on just one user.

2. Find out where a particular person is logged in:

% drwho-client -r -w schmidt
tango

This is useful for remote commands that require a hostname, e.g.:

% talk schmidt@`drwho-client -r -w schmidt`

or

% rsh `drwho-client -w schmidt` ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
  1844 pts/9    0:01 tcsh_6.0
  4821 ?        0:02 perfmete
    77 pts/20   0:01 tcsh_6.0
  4845 pts/2    0:00 tcsh_6.0
  4766 ?        0:00 xmessage
  4850 pts/3    0:06 tcsh_6.0
  5057 pts/4    0:01 tcsh_6.0
  4826 ?       18:07 netscape
  4802 ?        0:07 mwm
% foreach host (`drwho -r -l -w schmidt`)
? echo $host
? rsh $host w | egrep schmidt
? end
----------------------------------------

3. Find out which friends are logged in (* means currently active)

% drwho-client -r -f ~schmidt/.friends.dta
remote friends logged on
------------------------
------------------------
friends: 5      users: 168

----------------------------------------

4. Find out everyone who is logged in everywhere!

% drwho-client -r -a 
remote users logged on
------------------------
------------------------
friends: 37	users: 163
----------------------------------------

5. Print out all machines and who is logged into each one

% drwho-client -R -l
----------------------------------------
