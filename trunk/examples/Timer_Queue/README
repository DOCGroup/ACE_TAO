This directory contains two examples: <Async_Timer_Queue_Test> and
<Reactor_Timer_Queue_Test>.  They show how you can use various
mechanisms to schedule and handle time events.  Both programs are
interactive.  You can schedule or cancel time events and list all the
timers that are waiting to be triggered.  

Async_Timer_Queue_Test:
-----------------------

This example shows how to use singals as the mechanism to generate
time events.  (Notice that this example doesn't work on NT because of
NT's limited signal mechanism.)


Reactor_Timer_Queue_Test:
-------------------------

This example shows how to use ACE_Reactor as the time events
generating mechanism.
