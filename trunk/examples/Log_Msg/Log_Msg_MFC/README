                     MFC Logging Example documentation
                     =================================

The example in this directory is a Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)
example which illustrates how to write an ACE_Log_Msg_Callback which
can send debug output to the Microsoft debugger console.

This is very useful when debugging an MFC GUI-based application which
uses ACE.

NOTES
=====
 - Make sure that $ACE_ROOT/ace/acemfcd.lib is built before building this
   example.  Follow the instructions in $ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html for building
   ACE with Visual C++.  Do a Batch Build of ACE, and make sure that you build
   the target "ACE DLL - Win32 MFC Debug".

 - We must call ACE::init() and ACE::fini() in the right places
   otherwise we will get strange crashes and memory leaks
   when invoking ACE_Log_Msg::instance().
   A good place to invoke these methods is in the method which overrides
   CWinApp::InitInstance().
   In this example, we invoke these methods in CLog_Msg_MFCApp::InitInstance().

 - We must set the ACE_Log_Msg singleton to use our callback with:
    ACE_Log_Msg::instance()->msg_callback( &m_mfc_logger );
    ACE_Log_Msg::instance()->set_flags( ACE_Log_Msg::MSG_CALLBACK );

   This is also done in CLog_Msg_MFCApp::InitInstance().
