README:   DLL Test Example
--------------------------

This example deals with dynamically opening objects and accessing
methods from it. 

First, the pointer to the object is obtained by accessing symbol
of the function which can get the object pointer. Then the methods
in that library object is accessed.

Here, the Magazine class is an abstract class with various magazine 
objects like Newsweek and Today deriving form it. The libraries are 
dynamically linked on demand.

Thus, it can be changed on the fly and accessed with its new changes.

The ACE_DLL class used in this example is an helper class for 
performing various operations on the library object.

Execution:
---------

First, build the test program, which you can do on UNIX as follows:

% make

Then run the test program:

% test_dll

to exercise the test.
