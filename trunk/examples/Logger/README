This directory contains a simple client/server implementation of the
distributed logging server described in several papers in the C++
Report (which can be obtained via the following WWW URLs:
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/{Reactor1-93.ps.gz,Reactor2-93.ps.gz}).

The example consists of the following directories:

	. client

		This program talks directly to the server logging
		daemon.  The server daemon must be started before you
		can run this test. 

	. simple-server

		This program runs a simple, non-templated,
		single-threaded Reactive implementation of the
		distributed logging server daemon.

	. Acceptor-server

		This program runs templated, Acceptor-based
		single-threaded Reactive implementation of the
		distributed logging server daemon.

To see a more complex solution that implements the design described in
the C++ Report articles, please see the:

$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/{clients,lib,servers} 

directories.
