	* All MSVC 5.0 project files: Removed unnecessary library
 	  inclusions.  Most of them are not necessary.

Wed Nov 26 15:49:14 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU: added information
          on necessary OS patches.

Wed Nov 26 09:45:43 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h (ACE_PROPER_SINGLETON_INSTANTIATION): Corrected
 	  misspelling in the "! defined (MSC_VER)" branch.  I just happened
	  to notice this, so I don't know if anybody ever tried it and it
 	  failed.

Tue Nov 25 12:07:07 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_3.2.GNU: updated for
          OSF/1 3.2g/CXX 5.7.  Thanks to Dani Flexer <danif@ivory-sw.com>
          for the updates.

	* examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_multiple_loops.cpp (main): Made
 	  sure that the Proactor was removed from reactor.

	* ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (remove_handler_i,
 	  remove_suspended_handler_i): Make sure to preserve DONT_CALL
 	  with normal event entries.

	* ace/Proactor.cpp: 

	- A flag used to indicate when we are shutting down.  

	- Made sure to signal the timer event when we are closing down.  

	- Thread Manager: don't bother to wait (since the thread may have
 	  already gone). But make sure to close up the descriptor.  This
 	  may not be necessary in the future when THR_DETACHED is
 	  correctly implemented.

	* ace/Asynch_IO.h: Changed some code from protected to public.
  	  Even though these functions are really protected, sometimes it
 	  simplifies user code to be able to "fake" a result.  Users
 	  should use these with care.

	* examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp
 	  (handle_write_stream): Added code for partial write to socket.
  	  However it ever seems to do a short write ;-). Also made sure
 	  that the initial data coming from the AcceptEx call is also
 	  dumped to the file.  Thanks to Mark Rabotnikov
 	  (mark@netmanage.co.il) for pointing this out.
