        * DAnCE version 1.0.3 released.

Tue Jun  7 21:18:05 UTC 2011  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * dance/Plan_Launcher/Plan_Launcher.cpp:
        * tests/Plan_Launcher/EM-Delay/run_test_ns.pl:

          Rework the plan launcher options a bit.  --em-ior is back to requiring an
          argument, if no --{em,nm,lm}-ior option is specified, we default to
          name service lookup.

        * bin/dance_tests.lst:

        * dance/Plan_Launcher/Plan_Launcher.cpp:

          New option --manager-timeout which allows the user to indicate
          to the plan_launcher that it should wait a specified number of
          seconds for a manager (e.g., execution_manager) reference to
          become valid before proceeding with deployment.

        * tests/Plan_Launcher:
        * tests/Plan_Launcher/EM-Delay:
        * tests/Plan_Launcher/EM-Delay/run_test.pl:
        * tests/Plan_Launcher/EM-Delay/run_test_ns.pl:
        * bin/dance_tests.lst:

          New test to excercise the new delay on manager reference functionality.

Wed Jun  1 11:10:40 UTC 2011  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * dance/ExecutionManager/ExecutionManager_Module.cpp:

          Emit the IOR/register with the naming service closer to ORB
          activation to reduce the possibility of a race condition with
          the plan_launcher.

        * docs/Error_Messages.txt:
