    <h3>Building and Installing DAnCE</h3>
    <p>The first thing you should do to install DAnCE is to set the environment
      variable <code>DAnCE_ROOT</code> to
      be <code>$TAO_ROOT/DAnCE</code>, or whereever you have installed
      the DAnCE sources. Please refer
      to the <A href="../../ACE-INSTALL.html">ACE installation notes</A> and <A href="../TAO-INSTALL.html">
        TAO installation notes</A> for instructions on setting <code>$ACE_ROOT</code>
      and <code>$TAO_ROOT</code>, respectively. They are needed since DAnCE sits on
      top of ACE+TAO. Compiling ACE+TAO successfully is the <strong>first</strong> requirement
      for compiling DAnCE.
    </p>

    <h3>Supported Platforms for DAnCE</h3>
    <p>DAnCE should be usable on most platforms that TAO runs on. Please see <A href="../TAO-INSTALL.html">
        TAO's installation</A> pages for details
    </p>
    <p>If you have <A href="../../docs/ACE-porting.html">porting questions</A> or
      have a problem compiling DAnCE with TAO and ACE on the platforms shown above
      please send email to either <A href="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">ACE Newsgroup</A> or
      the <A href="mailto:ciao-users@list.isis.vanderbilt.edu">CIAO mailing list</A> and we'll
      try to help you fix the problems. You can also submit bug reports and
      enhancement requests in our <A href="../../docs/usage-bugzilla.html">bug tracking
        system</A>.
    </p>
    <p>DAnCE can be obtained <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/Download.html">electronically</a>
      via the WWW and ftp. <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DAnCE">DAnCE</a> is
      bundled with the ACE and TAO release. You'll always need the most recent
      version of ACE and TAO because DAnCE tracks changes to ACE and TAO very closely.
    </p>

    <h3>Obtaining and Installing Xerces-C</h3>
    <p>The Xerces-C XML parsing library is a necessary component to build parts of
      DAnCE that need to process XML based descriptor files, which include the <b>Plan
        Launcher</b> and the <b>Repository Manager</b>. Currently, the only Xerces-C
      versions supported by the DOC group is version 2.6 or later or 3.0 or later.
      Earlier versions of the Xerces-C library may work.
    </p>
    <h4>Building Xerces-C</h4>
    <p>You
      will have to obtain the source from the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">
        Xerces-C webpage</a> and build it. Building Xerces-C is fairly
      straightfoward. Please see the documentation available <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/build-3.html">
        here</a> for instructions particular to your platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Some of the provided projects with Xerces-C attach
      inconsistant library decorators onto the end of the Xerces-C libraries. The MPC
      build tool will expect these libraries to be named xerces-c for non debug
      versions, and xerces-cd for debug versions.
    </ul>
    <h4>Xerces-C Environment Settings</h4>
    <p>If the Xerces includes and libraries are in your system include and library
      paths, respectively, then you need not set up any environment and may proceed
      to the next step. If not, you will need to set an environment variable named
      XERCESCROOT to a path such that $XERCESCROOT/include points to the includes and
      $XERCESCROOT/lib points to the libraries. Also make sure that $XERCESCROOT/lib
      is in the appropriate environment variable that your platform uses to search
      for dynamically linked libraries.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>To build DAnCE core/tools/examples:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      Make sure ACE and TAO are built.
      <li>
      Make sure you have the Xerces-C libraries installed/built
      <li>
      Enable Xerces-C in default.features by setting <code>xerces3=1</code> or
      <code>xerces2=1</code>, depending on your version Xerces-C libraries.
      <li>
        Make sure all ACE/TAO/etc. generated libs are in <code>$ACE_ROOT/lib</code>. To
        build DAnCE you will need:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>ACE</code>
          <li>
            <code>TAO</code>
          <li>
            <code>TAO_IDL</code>
          <li>
            <code>IORTable</code>
        </ul>
      <li>
        Generate the Makefile/Solution/Project files and build
        <p>For the supported build tools please see <a href="../../MPC/docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html">
            MPC manual</a>.
        </p>
        <p>On <strong>Linux</strong>: do <code>$ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace DAnCE_TAO.mwc</code> in $DANCE_ROOT
        </p>
        <p>On <strong>Windows/VC8</strong>: do <code>%ACE_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type vc8</code>
          at the locations specified above then Open the solution file and build.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can run <code>mwc.pl</code> at <code>DANCE_ROOT.</code>
          After running the command
          with proper augment once then you
          can do <code>make</code> at <code>$DANCE_ROOT</code> (Linux) or open the
          workspace/solution file at <code>$DANCE_ROOT</code> (Windows) to build.
        </p>
