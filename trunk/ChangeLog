Fri Sep 28 06:17:27 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SPIPE_Acceptor.{h,cpp}: Fixed the use of "char" for "already_connected_"
	  to be "int".  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

	* ACE-INSTALL.html: Improved the installation instructions for BCB 4/5.
	  Thanks to Chris Kohloff for contributing this and to
	  Jan Kalin <jan.kalin@zag.si> for motivating this.

	* ace/TTY_IO.cpp: Fixed numerous bugs in the control() method.  Thanks to
	  Airat A. Sadreev <airatsa@nm.ru> for reporting this.
	
	* ace/TTY_IO.h: Add a new field for Win32.  Thanks to
	  Airat A. Sadreev <airatsa@nm.ru> for reporting this.

Thu Sep 27 06:12:21 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-win32.h: Added a special-case for Borland C++ Builder,
	  which must include vcl.h before windows.h.  Thanks to Chris
 	  Kohloff for reporting this.  This fixes Bug ID 899 for the time
 	  being.

	* ace/Module.cpp (ACE_Module): The line 
	
	  this->name ("<unknown>");
  
	  was  be replaced with
  
          this->name (ACE_TEXT("<unknown>"));  
	  
	  Thanks to Airat A. Sadreev <sadreevaa@hq.tatenergo.ru> for
 	  reporting this.  This fixes bug id 1041.

Thu Sep 27 13:09:19 2001  Bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.1.21 released.

Tue Sep 25 16:12:14 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i (recv_i):

	  Use ACE_OS::set_errno_to_last_error() set errno instead of doing
	  so manually to get around broken compilers that reset the last
	  error when assigning to errno.  Thanks to Chris Kohloff for
	  pointing out the problem and suggesting this fix.

Tue Sep 25 13:00:37 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Obstack.h: Fixed a typo when declaring ACE_Obstack
	  exportable.  I mistakenly used the underlying
	  ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARATION macro directly.
	  ACE_SINGLETON_DECLARATION is the right macro to use here.
          Thanks to Martin Krumpolec <krumpolec@asset.sk> for reporting
	  the bug.

Tue Sep 25 09:12:28 2001  Andrew Finnell  <Andrew.Finnell@esecurityinc.com>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i (recv_i):

	  On MS Windows, OpenSSL does not store the last error in errno so
	  explicitly do so.  This corrects problems where a server is
	  unaware that a client has forcefully disconnected.

Tue Sep 25 00:01:59 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Service_Repository.cpp (instance): There are three stages of
	  the Object Manager: (a) starting up; (b) running; (c) shutdown.
	  ACE_Service_Repository::instance() was not creating a new
	  instance in (a) and (c).  It was changed to allow creation (a).

Mon Sep 24 01:55:29 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

	  Added TAO's PICurrent test to the list of automated regression
	  tests.

Sun Sep 23 19:28:06 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Reactor.h (ACE_Reactor): Fixed comments for
	  <end_reactor_event_loop> and <reactor_event_loop_done>.  Both
	  methods work on an instance of reactor, not the global singleton
	  reactor.  Thanks to Doug for noticing this.

Sun Sep 23 10:02:59 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.h: Removed a question mark "?",  in a line
	  which read  "or sometimes 3.579 Mhz??". This seems to remove the
	  warning in VXWORKS builds. I have no clue about the problem that
	  VXWORKS compiler sees. It took only more than an hour to figure
	  this out. :(.

Sat Sep 22 08:59:24 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Service_Manager.cpp (handle_input): Added some logic to
	  strip off newlines and carriage returns for Windows platforms.
  	  Thanks to Kyle Brost <Kyle.Brost@quest.com> for contributing
 	  this.

Sat Sep 22 12:28:21 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/ACE_SSL_LIB.dsp:

	  Corrected code generation settings to use the multi-threaded DLL
	  version of the run-time library.  Corrects "legacy" build
	  problems.

Sat Sep 22 08:59:24 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/High_Res_Timer.{h,i,cpp}: Added comments to explain how
	  to configure the timers properly on various platforms.  Thanks
 	  to Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for reporting this.

	* ace/OS.i (ACE_Flow_Spec): Added a check for ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2_GQOS
	  so that things will compile properly on MinGW32.  Thanks to Jeff
 	  McNiel <JMcNiel@datacrit.com> for reporting this.

Fri Sep 21 15:54:55 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS_Dirent.cpp: Fixed all the allocations so they work properly
	  when used with ACE_TCHAR!  Thanks to Olof Lindfors
 	  <olof.lindfors@protegrity.com>.

Tue Sep 18 06:25:22 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/*Reactor*: Changed all uses of "delta_time" to "delay_time".
	  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Sun Sep 16 11:53:38 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Connector.cpp (handle_output): Fixed the comment to be
	  ACE_WIN32.  Thanks to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi@mivzak.com> for
 	  reporting this.

Fri Sep 21 17:11:52 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Message_Block.h: Tried rewording some comments in the
	  ACE_Message_Block. Thanks to Tom Wagner <TomW@CoManage.net> for
	  suggesting this.

	* THANKS: Added Tom Wagner <TomW@CoManage.net> to the hall of
	  fame.

Fri Sep 21 22:11:53 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/ACE_SSL_LIB.dsp:

	  Removed hardcoded user-specific include paths, and user-specific
	  preprocessor macro definitions.

Thu Sep 20 18:15:49 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Config_Test.cpp: Added some more tests to verify correct
          string value reset and enumerate values/sections.

Thu Sep 20 12:29:09 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/ACE_SSL_LIB.dsp:
	* ace/SSL/ACE_SSL_LIB.dsw:

	  New static build MSVC++ project and workspace files for the
	  ACE_SSL library contributed by Jonathan Reis <reis@stentor.com>.
	  [Bug 1032]

Thu Sep 20 12:16:13 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK.cpp (enable, disable):

	  Removed unreachable "return" statements.  [Bug 1033]

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i (ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream):
	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp:

	  Moved constructor to the ".cpp" file since to prevent inclusion
	  of `ace/Log_Msg.h' in `SSL_SOCK_Stream.h'.  This fixes problems
	  with some platforms needing the Log_Msg include to pull in the
	  ACE_ERROR macros without needlessly increasing inter-header
	  dependencies and inclusions.  [Bug 1034]

Thu Sep 20 14:44:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.cpp (ACE_Process_Options): Moved avoid_zombies_
          initialization outside the !Win32 section. Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen <johnny.willemsen@meco.nl> for this fix.

Thu Sep 20 06:28:50 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:

          Reverting the change from "Wed Aug 29 15:32:10 2001  Douglas C.
          Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>".  HP-UX 11.00 does
          not actually support pread/pwrite.

Wed Sep 19 16:56:02 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h (THR_SCOPE_PROCESS and THR_SCOPE_SYSTEM): Added
	  definitions for THR_SCOPE_PROCESS and THR_SCOPE_SYSTEM on
	  platforms that do not support threads.

Wed Sep 19 16:54:04 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp:

          In copy constructor for ACE_Double_Linked_List, added line to
          copy the size of the rhs to the lhs. The new list was ending
          up with a garbage value for its size.

Wed Sep 19 14:15:08 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace_dll.dsp:
	* ace/ace_lib.dsp: Enabled generation of debug info even for
	  release configurations.  Thanks to Jonathan Reis
	  <reis@stentor.com> for suggesting this.

Wed Sep 19 10:23:06 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * html/index.html:
          Add couple of missing links to the RT-CORBA components

Wed Sep 19 12:00:04 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Added BCB5 to some places as supported/used compiler

        * ace/Future.h:
        * ace/Test_and_Set.h:
          Removed the ACE_EXPORT from the templates ACE_Future_Holder and
          ACE_Test_and_Set

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,cpp}:
          Changed the type of the members be_a_daemon_ and no_static_svcs_
          from char to int

Tue Sep 18 13:57:36 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * */Makefile:
        * */Makefile.*:
          Updated dependencies, some of the paths were absolute leading to
          ambiguities in parallel builds.

Tue Sep 18 12:18:26 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/footprint_stats.sh:
          Fixed bug in footprint charts generation.

Tue Sep 18 10:50:15 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * html/index.html:
          Add COS Event and COS Notification services to the index.

Mon Sep 17 19:00:00 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          - THR_SCOPE_PROCESS and THR_SCOPE_SYSTEM were not defined
            for NT.  Added them.

          - Moved the following definitions of VxWorks around such
            that these defines are available even when PACE is not
            used.

            THR_INHERIT_SCHED
            THR_EXPLICIT_SCHED
            THR_SCHED_IO
            THR_SCOPE_SYSTEM
            THR_SCOPE_PROCESS

        * ace/OS.cpp: LinuxThreads do not have support for
          PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS; only PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM is supported.
          Therefore, PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS is ignored when setting the
          thread scheduling scope.

        * ace/Sample_History.cpp: Added accessors for <sample_count> and
          <max_samples>.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added new RTCORBA tests.  Removed
          Minimum CORBA dependency on these tests.

Mon Sep 17 13:49:07 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * etc/tao_cosevent.doxygen:
        * etc/tao_cosnotification.doxygen:
          Add new Doxygen files for the Notification and COS Event
          Services

        * bin/generate_doxygen.pl:
          Add new doxygen files to the automatically generated
          documentation.

Mon Sep 17 11:36:54 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/run_tests.lst: This is the script used by the shell
	  script in that directory. As the name is confusing this is being
	  moved as a new file.

	* tests/run_tests_remote.lst: Renamed the run_tests.lst as
	  run_tests_shell.lst. This is invoked by run_tests.sh

	* tests/run_tests.sh: Renamed as a new file.

	* tests/run_tests_remote.sh: Renamed the file run_tests.sh as this
	  one. This script can be used to run tests remotely on a
	  CHORUS/ClassiX/MVME targets. Further this can also be used to
	  run tests on platforms that dont support perl or do not have
	  perl.

Sun Sep 16 11:19:01 2001  Balachandran  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.1.20 released.

Sat Sep 15 16:58:08 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp: Fixed compile problem with Sun CC
          4.2.

Fri Sep 14 05:28:13 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: We now have over 1,300 contributors to ACE+TAO!

        * ace/Basic_Types.{h,i}: Added "const" to various operators and
          methods.  Thanks to Alain Decamps for reporting this.

Thu Sep 13 11:02:41 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Singleton.cpp: If we're not compiling with threading enabled,
          don't call the get_singleton_lock() code.  Thanks to Charles
          Frasch <cfrasch@spawar.navy.mil> for contributing this.

Tue Sep 11 06:23:08 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Array_Base.h: Changed current_ from u_int to size_t.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Fri Sep 14 17:18:37 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp (check_micro_nano): If the
          nanointerval is 0, change it to 1 to prevent divide-by-zero.

Fri Sep 14 17:02:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp: Replaced some (u_int) casts with
          ACE_U64_TO_U32, which is correct. Thanks to Alain Decamps, yet
          again!, for this fix.

Fri Sep 14 11:39:03 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Added Mahes Varadarajan and Kevin Clien to the hall of
          fame.

Thu Sep 13 22:43:34 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added the new Cache_Growth_Test to the
          daily tests.

Thu Sep 13 20:38:44 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.h (ACE_Thread_Manager): Changed the default
          argument <prealloc> for the constructor from 0 to
          ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_MANAGER_PREALLOC.  Thanks to Doug for
          pointing this out.

          Added better documentation to explain the purpose of each
          argument in ACE_Thread_Manager's constructor.  Thanks to Nick
          Pratt <npratt@microstrategy.com> for motivating the change.

Thu Sep 13 13:38:41 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (elapsed_time (ACE_hrtime_t&nanoseconds),
          elapsed_time_incr (ACE_hrtime_t&nanoseconds): Instead of using
          "nanoseconds >>= 10", use "nanoseconds = nanoseconds >> 10" to
          work around a Borland C++Builder bug. Thanks very much to
          Johnny Willemsen, Christopher Kohlhoff, and Alain Decamps
          for solving this problem.

Thu Sep 13 13:33:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/Log_Msg.h".
          This was probably to get AIX to build clean, but it's been a
          while.

Thu Sep 13 12:04:04 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Added Werner Buchert to the hall of fame.

Wed Sep 12 15:10:41 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (elapsed_time (ACE_hrtime_t&nanoseconds),
          elapsed_time_incr (ACE_hrtime_t&nanoseconds): Changes to account
          for very fast clocks (> 1GHz). Thank you to Derek Dominish
          <derek.dominish@boeing.com> and Alain Decamps
          <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for identifying the problem and coming
          up with a good solution. This fixes Bugzilla #1024 (how
          appropriate! ;-)

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.i (elapsed_microseconds (ACE_hrtime_t &usecs):
          More adjustment to the Win32 scale factor adjusting. Thanks (again!)
          to Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for identifying and
          supplying a fix for this. This fixes Bugzilla #948 (again).

Wed Sep 12 14:33:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp: Incorporated some additional tests
          for usec/nsec sanity checks on the calculated ACE_High_Res_Timer
          values. Thank you very much to Alain Decamps
          <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for this test.

Tue Sep 11 12:40:01 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Terror unleashed. The World Trade Center and the Pentagon
          attacked  today. Looks like there could be lots of loss to
          precious lives. This is too horrible. We convey our condolences
          to the bereaved families. God save this world.

Tue Sep 11 06:41:31 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Concrete_Connection_Handlers.cpp: Fixed a
          typo. This should fix most of the errors in the scoreboard.

Mon Sep 10 18:59:24 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp (nonblk_put):
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Concrete_Connection_Handlers.cpp (nonblk_put):
          Reverted Bala's changes below since the original code was
          correct.  Also, added comments to clarify things to prevent
          confusion in the future.

Mon Sep 10 17:31:11 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Added a new platform to the list.

Mon Sep 10 12:54:28 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Concrete_Connection_Handlers.cpp:
          Changed the condition  that checks for EWOULDBLOCK after a
          send. It was erroneously written. Thanks to Nick Pratt
          <npratt@microstrategy.com> for pointing this out.

Mon Sep 10 12:36:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp (nonblk_put): Changed the condition
          that checks for EWOULDBLOCK after a send. It was erroneously
          written. Thanks to Nick Pratt <npratt@microstrategy.com> for
          pointing this out.

Mon Sep 10 08:17:08 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Will not run the File_IO test in the
          Minimum CORBA configuration.

Mon Sep 10 08:05:39 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Prevented the DLL_ORB test from running
          in static builds.

Sun Sep  9 10:20:59 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * */Makefile: Updated dependencies.

Sun Sep  9 08:43:02 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Handle_Set.i: Added a check in set_bit () and clr_bit () for
          ACE_INVALID_HANDLE. If we pass a ACE_INVALID_HANDLE we were
          crashing which is not good and hence the fix.

Sun Sep  9 08:28:52 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp (is_dispatchable): Added a new
          method. This method, just figures out whether the buffer has any
          dispatchable info or not.

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp: Added the above method in the WFMO
          Reactor.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp: The handle_notify_events () method now
          checks whether the buffer it has read is dispatchable or not. If
          it is then it gives up the token to make an upcall. Else, it
          just sits around to remove messages of the pipe, till it find
          one with a dispatchable info. The fix was necessary  so that
          wake-up calls that are unanswered are removed of the
          pipe. Unanswered wakeup calls were filling up the pipe and they
          were blocking some application from writing further to the
          pipe. This should be in all probability be the final fix to the
          Reactor.

Sat Sep  8 09:34:52 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Fixed a typo that was giving
          compile errors in VXWORKS builds.

Fri Sep  7 16:40:37 2001  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ece.uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

Fri Sep  7 17:09:04 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.cpp: Initialised the lock
          to null  in the constrcutor before allocating memory for
          it. This was done to remove the ABW errors in
          purify. This should remove the problem that we see with this
          test in our daily builds with SunCC 4.2.

Fri Sep  7 15:51:48 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

Fri Sep  7 14:17:41 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp: Do not clear the notify handle bit when
          trying to dispatch notify calls. This shoudl fix the long

          Use relative paths to include and library files rather than
          $(ACE_ROOT). Makes it easier to use in place regardless of
          ACE version.

        * examples/C++NPv1/Logging_Client.cpp: Fixed scoping of the getline()
          method call.

Thu Sep  6 21:14:05 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Changed the usage of auto_ptr

        * ace/OS.h:
          Added a if-def case for IP_MULTICAST_IF. Seems like it is not

Thu Sep  6 10:24:15 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Acceptor.cpp (accept_svc_handler):
        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp (accept_svc_handler):

          Do not close and reopen the peer acceptor on failed attempts to
          accept a connection.  Several problems were fixed by removing
          this code:

                - A race condition existed where another thread or process
                could acquire the port that the peer acceptor was
                listening on before it was closed.  Note that it is not
                enough to attempt to synchronize this code with a lock
                since an external process could still acquire the port.

                - If the port in the peer acceptor (assuming it is an
                ACE_INET_Addr based one) is the wildcard port (zero), then
                there is no guarantee that the acceptor will be opened on
                the same port upon which it is was previously listening.
                In such a case, IORs generated by TAO (for example) can be
                rendered invalid since the addressing information embedded
                in those IORs will no longer contain the actual port to
                connect to when making invocations.  [Bug 962]

                - The above two problems actually introduced a
                denial-of-service attack vulnerability (now closed by this
                fix) since it was relatively easy to force a failed
                connection attempt, which would then cause the peer
                acceptor to be reopened on potentially a different port,
                or to shutdown completely if reopening failed.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.i (close):

          Invalidate the handle stored within the ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor
          instance.  Corrects problems arising from attempts to use a
          listening socket that has been shut down.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):

          Perform an OpenSSL SSL_accept() in case OpenSSL buffered data
          that must be handled before entering the Reactor event loop used
          to complete a non-blocking SSL passive connection.

          If the OpenSSL error status is SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN shut down
          the partially initialized SSL stream/session since the peer has
          itself shut down.

Thu Sep  6 11:00:46 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp: The timer events are not included as a part
          of  number of active handles from wait_for_multiple_events
          (). The check for event_count > 0 before processing timer events
          was wrong. Removed the check. Thanks to Chad Elliott for
          pointing this out.

          Further did some cosmetic changes like adding comments, removing
          comments that was not valid etc.

Thu Sep  6 07:50:56 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: The AMI buffering test should not be run

        * ace/QoS/QoS_Session.h: Reverted the change "Wed Sep  5 18:58:00
          2001 Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>". The change
          broke builds. Further there was no reason why the QoS
          information should come inside OS.* files. Talk about increasing
          foot print.

          Added rapi_sender and rapi_reserve calls with null tspec and
          flow spec respectively to facilitate the tearing down of PATH
          and RESV messages.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS.i:

          Changed the sending_flowspec_ and receiving_flowspec_ members of
          the ACE_QoS class to pointers so they can be initialized to null
          flow specs.

Wed Sep  5 16:50:03 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Added Peter Phillips <pphillip@opentext.com> to the hall

Wed Sep 05 12:00:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix4_g++.GNU: Sets ACE_AIX_VERS rather
          than separate major/minor; see entry below for further info.

Wed Sep 05 11:52:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix5.1.h: New config file for AIX 5L, version 5.1,
          using Visual Age C++ 5.

        * ace/config-aix-4.1.x.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.2.x.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.3.x.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Use ACE_AIX_VERS (which has both major and
          minor version) rather than ACE_AIX_MAJOR_VERS and ACE_AIX_MINOR_VERS.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Rather than making
          separate major/minor OS version variables, use one that incorporates
          both to make it easier for config.h files to set upwardly-compatible
          feature flags.

Wed Sep  5 06:55:44 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:

          Add ACE_TEXT() around the default program name for the Windows
          WChar Unicode build.

Tue Sep  4 18:48:00 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Changed the value returned from
          ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify_Handler::handle_input (). This now
          returns a 0 if we did not dispatch any handles or the number of
          handles dispatched. We were returning a -1 if we did not
          dispatch any handles, after reading the notification from the
          pipe. This should fix the Reactor_Notify_Test in the Implicit
          templates build.

Tue Sep  4 12:46:50 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

          Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>". Thanks to Irfan
          for pointing that this change, changes the semantics of the

          Work around a compiler bug in the latest Green Hills Multi200.
          Casting a float to an ACE_CDR::ULong* caused internal compiler
          errors if the code was inlined.

Tue Sep  4 07:37:17 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp: Fixed a bug with recv_n_i (). The problem was form
          returning the exact number of bytes from the for loop. If the
          loop had executed once and if we get 0 in the next recv_i ()
          call, then we should be returning the number of bytes read in
          the previous iteration and not 0. Thanks to Eyal Neuman
          <eyal@tradertools.com> for this fix. This closes bug 1015.

Mon Sep  3 07:54:32 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_String.cpp: Fixed compile errors in win32 builds. Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for sending in patches for replacing L with
          ACE_TEXT_WIDE.

Sun Sep  2 19:33:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Fixed a small problem with the
          select reactor's notify () handling mechanism. This was more of
          a problem with me not checking the while () loop condition
          properly. This should fix most of the reactor problems seen in
          the daily builds.

          method.  Thanks to Alain for reporting this.

        * ace/OS_String.{h,cpp}: Added a "safe" c string copy method:
          strsncpy(dst,src,maxlen).  Changing an occurence off strncpy()
          to strsncpy() is less errorprone, but could break somebody's
          code if he/she is using the fact that the strncpy's where
          nul-padding the destination, but this is extremely
          unlikely. Using strsncpy() is also almost always (a lot) faster
          than strncpy().  Thanks to Alain Decamps
          <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for this method.

Sat Sep  1 09:54:55 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.cpp: Added a patch from Chris Kohlhoff that
          fixes the problem with VXWORKS builds. The old gcc compiler
          seems to have problems with forward declared types as template
          parameters. Chris solves the problem by defining a ABC properly
          and making the offending class inherit from it. This should fix
          our daily VXWORKS builds.

Sat Sep  1 08:07:51 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Fixed a compilation error  in the
          Notification queue portion of the code. Thanks to our daily
          builds for helping me with this testing.

Fri Aug 31 22:12:26 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:

Fri Aug 31 22:07:57 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp: Added the method read_notify_pipe () to
          the WFMO_Notify_Handler.

Fri Aug 31 19:14:52 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h: Added a new method by name read_notify_pipe
          (). Also changed the dispatch_notify () to take in a
          Notification buffer instead of a ACE_HANDLE.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h: Made the following changes

          - Implemented read_notify_pipe (). Will read just one message from
            the notify pipe or one message from the notification queue.

          - Reimplemented dispatch_notify (). This method would just
            dispatch the upcall using the information in the notification
            buffer.

          - The handle_input () now uses the read_notify_pipe () and
            dispatch_notify () to achieve what it was doing before.

          - The notify () call now sends one notify message on the pipe
            for every message in the notification queue.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (handle_socket_events):
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.i: We had a race condition. The race condition
          was because two threads were trying to read from the notify_pipe
          at the same instance. This race condition was fixed by adding a
          call to read_notify_pipe () with the lock held and then calling
          dispatch_notify () with the buffer read after releasing the
          lock.  Did the following minor modifications

          - Changed dispatch_socket_events () as dispatch_socket_event ()
            as we were dispatching only one event.

          - We dont grab the token in the constructor of the token. We
            have to make a call specfically to grab_token () to get the
            token.

        The above checkins should fix the correctness of the reactor
        problems that we have been seeing.

Fri Aug 31 18:30:28 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

          Added Blocking_Sync_None to the list of tests to be run on
          Tru64.

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

         * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:
         * ace/config-tandem.h:

           Fixed up documentation of ACE_TIMER_SKEW. Fixed bogus values in
           all the above files. Should help in removing some of the errors
           in TAO tests. Any test in ACE/TAO which breaks because of this
           change is broken and should be fixed.

Fri Aug 31 12:00:00 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.icc: New Visual Age C++ config for this test.
        * tests/tests.icp: Added Bound_Ptr_Test.icc, Service_Config_Test.icc,
                           and libService_Config_DLL.icc.

Fri Aug 31 11:40:31 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.(cpp h): Fixed single-threaded builds.

Fri Aug 31 08:13:26 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/perltest2cpp.pl:

          Added a -t option to set the timeout factor.

Thu Aug 30 18:08:32 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          Added some more missing stuff which might break compilations.
          The previous change also removed the existing definition for
          ACE_TIMER_SKEW so add it back till the new version is checked in.

Thu Aug 30 17:54:40 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          This file was checked in inadvertently when checking in fixes
          for ACE_NEEDS_HUGE_THREAD_STACKSIZE.

Thu Aug 30 13:04:38 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Added Bound_Ptr_Test.

Thu Aug 30 11:40:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.pl (run_program): Fixed the 'unlink' to get
          all of a test's log files; prevents seeing previous sub-logs
          from a test such as MEM_Stream_Test and falsely reporting errors.

Thu Aug 30 10:46:51 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (global_scale_factor ()): When checking for
          a high-res timer mechanism, don't set the global_scale_factor_status_
          away from 0 until _after_ getting the scale factor, to avoid
          a second parallel thread from using a bogus value. Thanks very much
          to Alain Decamps for this fix.

Thu Aug 30 09:30:19 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:

          Fix for VxWorks when ace_main() is called with argc == 0.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Update the list of tests that run on VxWorks.

        * tests/Makefile:
        * tests/run_test.pl:

          Update the script to output VxWorks commands to a file.

Thu Aug 30 09:58:38 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.i (elapsed_microseconds): For Win32, isolate the
          msec modulus before converting it up to usecs. Thanks to Francois
          Rioux <rioux01@gel.ulaval.ca> for reporting this.

Thu Aug 30 00:42:41 2001  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:
          Service_Object instances are now inserted into the Service_Repository
          only after they have been successfully initialised, to provide better
          support for recursive use of the service configurator. With this
          change, a service loaded from 'inside' another services's init() will
          be inserted into the repository first and unloaded last. This ensures
          that any recursively loaded services on which the original service
          depends still exist when the original service's fini() function is
          called.

Thu Aug 30 00:27:05 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ChangeLog:

          Removed bogus files from the previous entry. I should not play
          around with a lot of tasks at once.

Wed Aug 29 19:57:29 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h:

          Remove definition of ACE_NEEDS_HUGE_THREAD_STACKSIZE. The
          default value seems to be good enough.

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
        * ace/config-qnx-neutrino.h:
        * ace/config-rtems.h:

          Standardized the values to 64KB on these platforms. Don't know
          if these platforms need it. But I don't have access to any of
          these so playing it safe.


Wed Aug 29 18:52:12 2001  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.cpp:
          Removed a stray asterisk that was causing compilation failures.

Wed Aug 29 17:54:52 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/libDLL_Test.icc:
        * tests/libService_Config_DLL.icc: Fixed the "run after" directives
          to correctly build the lib*.a files. Also, fixed the cleanup
          directives to properly clean up both .a and shr.o files.

Wed Aug 29 15:32:10 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h:
        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h: Added better support for pread()/pwrite().
          Thanks to Steve Vranyes <steve.vranyes@veritas.com> for these fixes.

Wed Aug 29 15:47:33 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Re-enabled MEM_Stream_Test.

Wed Aug 29 12:15:01 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:  Added Bound_Ptr.* to the projects.

        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.dsp: Added a new project for
          Bound_Ptr_Test.

Wed Aug 29 11:01:22 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Fixed a cut/paste error and now runs the
          proper number of threads/processes for the MT case, avoiding a
          hang.

Wed Aug 29 07:08:23 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_tests.lst:
        * tests/Makefile
        * tests/Makefile.bor
        * ace/Makefile
        * ace/Bound_Ptr.{h,i}
        * tests/Bound_Ptr_Test.cpp
        * examples/Smart_Pointer: Added a pair of new smart pointer classes,
          ACE_Strong_Bound_Ptr and ACE_Weak_Bound_Ptr.  Thanks to
          Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for contributing
          these.

Tue Aug 28 17:51:19 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.pl: If a test has log files associated with the
          main log of the form <test>-<other>.log, e.g. MEM_Stream_Test-331.log
          the check_log function will scan those for errors/warnings too.

Tue Aug 28 16:48:23 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.i: We (the current thread) should not release the
          token unless we own it. This simple mistake just took 3 days to
          figure out. An 'if' condition was mixing and have added
          it. Shows how a small problem at lower levels can take days to
          fix.

Tue Aug 28 17:45:22 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Fixed compile warning on gcc.

Tue Aug 28 13:16:31 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/vxworks_modify.pl:
        * bin/perltest2cpp.pl:

          Generated c++ files now pass the fuzz check.

Tue Aug 28 11:02:08 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst:

          Renamed the GCC 3.0 build to "Debian_GCC_3.0.1." since we're
          actually compiling with GCC 3.0.1, not GCC 3.0.  The latter has
          bugs that prevent it from compiling ACE/TAO at the "-O3"
          optimization level.

Tue Aug 28 10:19:18 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i (recv_i):

          Corrected Borland warning using a more efficient fix (i.e. less
          function calls).

Tue Aug 28 10:36:10 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/vxworks_modify.pl:
        * bin/perltest2cpp.pl:

          Added these scripts for use with VxWorks and the newly added TAO
          TestUtils.  These scripts modify c++ and perl to generate
          "one-button" modules for TAO testing on VxWorks.

Tue Aug 28 11:07:26 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Be sure to close the stream from the
          client end.

Mon Aug 27 20:16:38 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Removed the MEM_Stream_Test from the daily
          builds as they were hanging. This was causing the builds to
          choke. I will keep Steve Huston informed on this so that he can
          reenable them once he has fixed the test.

Mon Aug 27 18:33:59 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst (WEB):

          Removed the stray yoda part of LIST which is causing the wrong
          results to show up.

Mon Aug 27 18:14:38 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst (WEB):

          Added the IA-64 builds back again. We now have a faster machine
          running a better version of Linux.

Mon Aug 27 09:39:33 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.i (get_dispatch_info):
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.h: Fixed the compile problem in VXWORKS
          builds. How could I forget that there are a few compilers which
          cannot grok traits?

Mon Aug 27 09:39:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Makefile.bor:
        * examples/NT_Service/Makefile.bor
          Added BCB makefile for this example

Sun Aug 26 22:08:32 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.i: Reordered methods to fix warnings in TRU 64
          builds.

Sun Aug 26 20:50:22 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i: Fixed a warning (hopefully) in
          Borland builds. The warning was because a temporary variable was
          created.

Sun Aug 26 20:45:24 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Fixed a unused variable warning in
          Borland.

Sun Aug 26 08:13:12 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/test_config.h: Added a new ACE_CLOSE_TEST_LOG macro.  Thanks to
          Edan for this.

Sun Aug 26 09:07:32 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp: Fixed a compile error with SunCC4.2

Sun Aug 26 08:28:09 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp: Fixed a warning from an unused variable
          reported by KCC compilers.

Sun Aug 26 08:13:12 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Applied the following fixes from
          Edan:

          - Included ace/Logging_Strategy.h
          - Addition of -w switch to enable initial wipeout of logfile
          - Removal of the redundant ACE_LOG_MSG->open()
          - Explicitly close the previous log before applying the changes to the
            ACE_LOG_MSG
          - Moved remove_files() call higher, just before logfile close

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.{h,cpp}: Added the following fixes from
          Edan Ayal:

          - Logging_Strategy now supports any ACE_Log_Msg, not just the
            ACE_LOG_MSG singleton.
          - Added a check for success (ios::goodbit) of new ofstream
            creation.
          - Changed default values for max_size and interval. Now the
            default interval is 10 minutes (instead of 0) and the default
            log file size is 0 (was 16K). The timer is now activated only
            if both are non-zero.
          - Added a mutator to set the ACE_Log_Msg to work with, and a
            member variable
          - Added definition for ACE_DEFAULT_LOGFILE_POLL_INTERVAL
          - Removed definition of ACE_DEFAULT_MAX_LOGFILE_SIZE

        * ace/Log_Record.{h,cpp}: Enhanced this implementation to (1)
          be consistent with recent changes to Log_Msg.h and (2) to
          replace problematic use of strncpy().  Thanks to Alain
          Decamps for these fixes.

Sat Aug 25 20:58:22 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/FILE_IO.i (send_n): Changed to use ACE::write_n to send the
          chain of Message_Blocks.  The originally used ACE::send_n was
          causing problem on NT because send_n was restricted for sockets
          I/O on NT.  Thanks to Doug for pointing this out.

Sat Aug 25 10:16:21 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Svc_Handler_Test.cpp (main): The destructor of svc_handler
          will close file_io, so we don't need to do it explicitly!

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Changed range check from

          this->msg_ + ACE_Log_Record::MAXLOGMSGLEN

          to

          this->msg_ + sizeof this->msg_

          to correspond to the change below.

        * ace/Log_Msg.h (ACE_Log_Msg): Increased the size of the buffer
          used to store log records to account for the NUL-terminator.

        * tests/Svc_Handler_Test.cpp (main): Changed the buffer size
          and NUL-terminated the buffer so that things print correctly.
          Thanks to Nanbor for finding this.

Sat Aug 25 09:00:28 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h (ACE_TP_Reactor): Fixed  a warning in KCC
          builds.

Sat Aug 25 08:42:57 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp: Fixed warnings with g++. I
          am not sure how this fix will be accepted on different
          compilers.  Things are always dicy when you want to delete a
          void *.

Fri Aug 24 23:29:09 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added File_IO test to our daily builds.

Fri Aug 24 23:12:15 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (dispatch_notify): Fixed a compile error on
          MSVC.

Fri Aug 24 23:07:42 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp: Fixed a compile error with
          g++.

Fri Aug 24 21:55:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/QoS/QoS_Session_Impl.cpp:
          Check for null parameters in rsvp_callback().
          Thanks to Yamuna Krishnamurthy <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>.

Fri Aug 24 20:32:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Changed this test to use multiple
          processes on any platform without ACE_LACKS_FORK. It actually
          could be broader than this if desired. This is motivated by the
          fact that HP-UX can't mmap() (the call underlying ACE_MEM_IO)
          the same file more than once in the same process. With this,
          MEM_Stream_Test goes a lot better on HP-UX, though not perfectly
          yet.

Fri Aug 24 16:54:02 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.h (recv_i):

          Added a timeout parameter.  See below for details.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.i (recv_i):

          Perform an SSL_read() before attempting to block on select()
          with a timeout.  OpenSSL may buffer more data than requested
          since it is a record-oriented protocol.  Fixes a problem where
          subsequent calls to ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream::recv() could timeout
          when needlessly blocking on select() because the expected data
          has already been buffered by OpenSSL.  Thanks to Martin
          Krumpolec <krumpo@pobox.sk> for reporting and diagnosing the
          problem.  [Bug 1006]

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (recv):

          Moved the timed recv() code to the lower level recv_i() method
          since timeout support must now be more tightly integrated with
          do/while(SSL_pending()) SSL_read() loop.

Fri Aug 24 18:33:09 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp (ACE_Function_Node): Make sure to dynamically
          allocate the pathname_ so we can delete it!   Thanks to
          Don Hinton for reporting this.

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp: Changed a couple of
          delete (char *) buf to delete (char *) [] buf.  Thanks to
          Don Hinton for reporting this.

Fri Aug 24 16:10:20 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        Merged in changes from the reactor_deadlock branch. This set of
        changes actually fixes a long standing problem with the
        TP_Reactor. The TP_Reactor was holding the token too long  and
        this created all sorts of problems for TAO. The changes have been
        merged from the branch <reactor_deadlock> and here are the relevant
        ChangeLog entries.

        Fri Aug 24 14:59:52 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (dispatch_socket_events): Cosmetic changes.

        Fri Aug 24 14:19:02 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.i:
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.h:Removed the default constructor and
          destructor for ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T allowing the
          compiler to do the job.

          Fri Aug 24 12:05:25 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp: Removed some vague debug statements.

        Fri Aug 24 11:34:11 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.h:
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp:
        * ace/Timer_Queue_T.i: Added a new class
          ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T that has the dispatch information
          needed to make the upcall. Added methods, dispatch_info () and
          dispatch_info_i () in ACE_Timer_Queue_T. These methods return
          the dispatch information if there is a node in the queue whose
          timer value <= current time. Changed the expire () method to use
          this method to get dispatch information.

        * ace/Timer_Queue.h: Added a template specialisation for
          ACE_Timer_Node_Dispatch_Info_T.

        * ace/Timer_Queue.cpp: Added template instantiations for the
          specialisation.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp: Added a new method handle_timer_events ()
          that would handles timer events.

        Thu Aug 23 11:50:18 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h: Added two new methods notify_handle () and
          dispatch_notify () to the ACE_Reactor_Impl class.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Implemented the above two
          methods in the ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify class. The
          notify_handle () method returns the handle of the pipe on which
          it is listening. The dispatch_notify () call does a dispatch of
          just one notify () call in the notify pipe. The handle_input ()
          call that used to process all the notify calls now calls the
          dispatch_notify () in a loop.  The change essentially allows
          some extrenal client of this class to just process one notify at
          a time if needed.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.i:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (handle_events): Fixed a bug with
          handle_events (ACE_Time_Value &). This should be calling the
          handle_events () of the TP_Reactor and not the select reactor.

          Added a whole slew of new methods that basically allows us to do
          this
            - handle one event at a time

            - once the thread knows the event that needs handling it should
              release the token before dispatching the events

          The new methods that have been added are

            - handle_signals (), which handle signals that interrupted the
              select (). The implementation of this method is busted. The
              implementation has been copied from the existing setup

            - handle_notify_events (), which handles one notify on the
              notify_pipe at a time

            - handle_socket_events (), which handles socket events.

          Quite a few helper methods have also been added. They are
          get_notify_handle (), get_socket_event_info (), and
          dispatch_socket_events (). Removed the methods dispatch_i (),
          dispatch_i_protected () and notify_handle (). This checkin fixes
          the problem in 1002. But we still have to add handling timeouts
          into the TP_Reactor.


        Tue Aug 21 17:21:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.i:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp: Made lots of changes which havent been
          compiled yet.  Added a new class ACE_TP_Token_Guard that helps
          in obtaining and releasing tokens. Moved the grab_token () from
          the ACE_TP_Reactor class to the TP_Token_Guard class. Added a
          new method for handling signals. They havent been compiled yet
          and this checkin is to put files from work to my home box.

        Tue Aug 21 07:58:42 2001 Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.i:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (handle_events): Started refactoring some of
          the code to help with this bug.  This change has not been
          compiled. This is just being done to transfer files from home
          to work.

Fri Aug 24 14:25:31 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Added Massimo Pichini <massimo@webbridges.it> to the
          hall of fame.

Fri Aug 24 13:40:01 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst: Removed HPUX and AIX_VAC for the
          timebeing. Looks like OCI is running different versions of the
          OS for their internal use.

Fri Aug 24 10:17:00 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log_hexdump): Added a patch provided by Massimo
          Pichini <massimo@webbridges.it>. This prevents overflows with
          long strings that are used in printing hexdumps. Previously we
          had a buffer of 80 bytes on the stack.

Fri Aug 24 10:03:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.(h cpp): Applied changes submitted by
          Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> to insure that
          get_host_name (char hostname[], size_t len) const always
          nul-terminates the hostname string. If the host lookup is
          successful, but the supplied buffer is too short, the function
          returns -1, errno == ENOSPC.

Thu Aug 23 22:01:11 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Reverted this change "Thu Aug
          23 05:24:57 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt" as this was giving
          warnings with MSVC 6.0

Thu Aug 23 11:49:15 2001  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Revert changes from Mon Aug 20 15:48:30 2001.
          Thanks to Darrell to showing me the error in my ways.

Thu Aug 23 09:17:25 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (file): Reduced the number of bytes copied in
          ACE_Log_Msg::file () and ACE_Log_Msg::msg () by one. Thanks to
          Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for pointing this out.

Thu Aug 23 08:11:22 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp (process_previous_line_format):
          Prepend ACE_OS:: to atoi to work with both narrow and wide chars.

Thu Aug 23 08:03:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/QoS/QoS_Session_Impl.cpp:
          Improve debugging messages.  Return -1 inside rsvp_callback()
          if flowspec type is unknown.

Thu Aug 23 05:24:57 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Added new and improved test that
          it better documented and fixes some minor bugs.  Thanks to
          Edan Ayal for this.

Wed Aug 22 19:04:57 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp: Enable this test to work
          on platforms that don't support DLLs.  Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edana@bandwiz.com> for suggestion this and providing the code.

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp (parse_args): Changed 'n' for 'N'
          since that controls the max number of log files.  Thanks to Edan
          Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for reporting this.

Thu Aug 23 07:30:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SString.{h,i}: Added clear() method to the ACE_CString and
          ACE_WString so that it is possible to clear a string in just one
          call
        * tests/SString_Test.cpp: Extended to test clear() method

Wed Aug 22 15:30:05 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile:
          Use the print_config.pl script to print out the configuration.

Wed Aug 22 17:33:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        Applied fixes submitted by Jerry D. Odenwelder, to fix
        Bugzilla #953:

        * ace/Configuration.cpp (import_config, export_config): Changed
          from using a ACE_Ini_ImpExp object to an ACE_Registry_ImpExp
          to preserve type information in the import/export files, and
          retain the ability to read an ACE 5.1-format file (with the
          changes next...)

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.(h cpp): Added a new
          ACE_Registry_ImpExp::process_previous_line_format() method that
          knows how to read an ACE 5.1-format config line. If
          ACE_Registry_ImpExp::import_config finds a line that does not
          begin with one of <"[#;> it calls process_previous_line_format
          to try to convert it using ACE 5.1-format rules.
          Note that the auto conversion works on import. If the
          object is subsequently exported, the new registry format
          will be used to write the file, effectively updating it
          from old to new format.

Wed Aug 22 12:04:04 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h (ACE_WFMO_Reactor): Clarified that the
          work_pending() method isn't implemented and suggest what to do
          for a workaround.  Thanks to Michelangelo Riccobene
          (michelangelo.riccobene@marconi.com) for reporting this.

Wed Aug 22 10:38:08 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/print_config.pl:
          Add new perl script to print out the build configuration, the
          script will be shared by the Unix and Win32 builds.

Wed Aug 22 11:30:13 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Memory.h:
          Removed include of pace/stddef.h. PACE does not have this
          file. There are no POSIX functions that typically reside
          in this header. Maybe PACE will need this later but it
          doesn't now.

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_cond_t):
          Modified #if guard to include ACE_cond_t class if we're
          on Win32. If we're using PACE then we don't want this method
          (since PACE takes care of it) unless we're on Windows. Win32
          mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables are not yet
          supported in PACE.

        * ace/OS.cpp (ACE_OS::cond_destroy):
          Modified #if guard to include ACE_cond_t::cond_destroy
          if we're on Win32. If we're using PACE then we don't want
          this method (since PACE takes care of it) unless we're on
          Windows. Win32 mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables
          are not yet supported in PACE.

        * ace/OS.i (ACE_OS::waiters):
          Modified #if guard to include ACE_cond_t::waiters if
          we're not on Win32. If we're using PACE then we want
          this method (since PACE defines cond_t) unless we're
          on Windows. Win32 mutexes, semaphores, and condition
          variables are not yet supported in PACE.

Tue Aug 21 08:26:30 2001  David L. Levine <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html: changed the example referenced
          in:
          Sun Aug 19 08:17:14 2001  David L. Levine <levine@cs.wustl.edu>
          to be a bit more realistic.

Tue Aug 21 06:58:49 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Fixed problematic uses of strncpy. Thanks to
          Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@advalvas.be> for giving this patch.

Tue Aug 21 10:40:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Map.i: Made the return value of ACE_Incremental_Key_Generator
          getCurrentValue() const

        * ace/Map_Manager.*: Added a const iterator for the
          ACE_Map_Manager

Mon Aug 20 18:20:51 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.cpp (pass_handle): Only try to compile the
          DuplicateHandle stuff when !ACE_HAS_WINCE... I think it's
          right this time...

Mon Aug 20 15:54:46 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SUN_Proactor.cpp: Removed the instantiation of
          ACE_Condition<ACE_Thread_Mutex>.  Thanks to David Trusty
          <david.trusty@westwave.com> for reporting this.

Mon Aug 20 15:48:30 2001  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Modify script to print config.h contents.

Mon Aug 20 13:14:00 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile:
          Fixed chdir commands for the auto_compile scripts.

Mon Aug 20 14:33:31 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp: If we timeout in the semaphore implementation
          of the message queue in wait_not_full_cond() or
          wait_not_empty_cond() make sure to decrement the "waiters" count
          accordingly!  Thanks to Patrick Rabau <Patrick.Rabau@htc.com>
          for noticing this in the C++NPv1 book version!

Mon Aug 20 07:01:31 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.i (release): If owner_ == -1 then return
          -1.  Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@swan.fr> for suggesting this.

Mon Aug 20 13:18:51 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK.h: Corrected comment on ACE_SOCK ctor being protected,
          not private. Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@swan.fr> for
          pointing this out.

        * THANKS: Added Don Hinton to the Hall of Fame.

Mon Aug 20 11:00:50 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS.h:

          Set the ACE_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMS to the correct value for VxWorks.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Removed tests for VxWorks for which the platform has no support.

        * tests/CDR_File_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Svc_Handler_Test.cpp:

          Add VxWorks to the list of platforms that can't unlink the file
          in advance of the test completing.

Mon Aug 20 01:49:12 2001  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * include/makeinclude/build_dll.bor:
          Build non-core DLLs into the common bin directory. This is necessary
          so that the tests can find all the DLLs they need on the path.

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Removed the append of the ExeSubDir to the path, since it is no
          longer needed and never really worked properly anyway.

Mon Aug 20 00:01:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Connector.h: Clarify the conditions under which errno
          will be ETIME (caller-specified timeout expires w/o connect)
          vs. ETIMEDOUT (protocol layer timed out the connect).

        * ace/SOCK_Connector.cpp: Add "|| errno == ETIME" to a couple
          places where an ACE_ERROR is _not_ done for certain conditions.

        * ace/ACE.cpp (handle_timed_complete): If the user-specified timeout
          expires before the connect is resolved one way or the other,
          set errno to ETIME, not ETIMEDOUT. This makes it match the
          documented behavior in the ACE_SOCK_Connector man page.

Sun Aug 19 20:33:39 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst:
          Update build list

Sun Aug 19 15:36:23 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile:
          Add new 'Config' section at the end of the build, useful for the
          next generation scoreboard.

Sun Aug 19 13:25:51 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/footprint_stats.sh:
        * bin/performance_stats.sh:
        * bin/generate_footprint_chart.sh:
        * bin/generate_performance_chart.sh:
        * html/Stats/Stats.css:
        * html/Stats/configuration.shtml:
        * html/Stats/detailed_footprint.shtml:
        * html/Stats/detailed_performance.shtml:
        * html/Stats/footer.html:
        * html/Stats/index.shtml:
        * html/Stats/navigation.html:
          Put the scripts and HTML documents used to generate the Stats
          pages under CVS control.  Now it is easier for people to add
          their own libraries and tests, as well as let our user community
          examine the way the pages are generated.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:
          Remove TAO/tests/LongUpcalls/run_ami_test.pl, the tests have
          been incorporated into the run_test.pl script.

        * bin/sandbox.cpp:
          Minor changes to the sandbox script, actually not very useful,
          the ACE classes to create processes start a new process group by
          default, therefore there is no simple way to kill all the
          subprocesses if a test fails.

Sun Aug 19 08:17:14 2001  David L. Levine <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html: replaced function call in
          ASSERT with simple comparison of a variable value.  Thanks
          to Tino Schwarze <tino.schwarze@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>
          for suggesting this.

Sat Aug 18 18:26:24 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp: Removed the ASYS_INLINE macro from the definition
          of write_n ().

Sat Aug 18 13:18:10 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.{h,cpp}: Added a new write_n(...ACE_Message_Block *...)
          for file transfers that's the dual of
          send_n(...ACE_Message_Block *...).  This helps out the C++NPv1
          book symmetry.  Thanks to Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be>
          for motivating this.

Fri Aug 17 18:17:38 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/clone.cpp: Only use extern char *sys_errlist[] if we're not
          compiling on Linux.  Thanks to Thomas Groth
          <groth.th@stn-atlas.de> for reporting this.

Fri Aug 17 19:04:31 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.cpp (ACE_Process_Options::pass_handle): For WinCE,
          just do ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN (-1). It can't dup a handle.

Fri Aug 17 16:56:16 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:

          Added wr_ptr() accessor method to ACE_InputCDR, and added its
          use to adjust(), align_read_ptr(), read_1(), skip_string() and
          skip_bytes() instead of end().  Also added reset of good_bit_
          to 0 upon failure in read_string() and read_wstring(). Thanks to
          Peter Phillips <pphillip@opentext.com> for reporting this bug,
          which was causing excessive memory allocation is some cases.
          [Bug 591, 944, 983]

Fri Aug 17 13:31:45 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/run_test.pl:

          Added the ability to generate windsh commands to load and run
          the ace tests.

        * tests/Makefile:

          Added a rule to generate run_test.vxworks, using run_test.pl,
          which can be used to run the tests selected for the VxWorks OS.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Update this list to take into account the limitations of VxWorks.

        * tests/test_config.h:

          Change the permissions of the log file open (for VxWorks only) to
          use the symbolic permission names instead of 0x644.  The
          permissions differ from the standard UNIX modes.

        * tests/run_tests.vxworks:

          This file was out of date and no longer needs to be maintained.
          So, it has been removed.

Fri Aug 17 09:44:49 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Map_T.{h,i}: Reverted this change "Fri Aug 17 08:07:12 2001
          Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>" as this was giving too
          much of warnings in the builds.

Fri Aug 17 09:30:34 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * gperf/apps/tests/Makefile: Fixed the problem that was causing
          the builds to fail.

Fri Aug 17 08:07:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Map_T.(h i): made the return value of
          ACE_Incremental_Key_Generator::current_value const T& instead
          of T&. Added uppercase traits to the ACE_Map class.

Thu Aug 16 19:27:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.cpp (ACE_Process_Options::pass_handle): Add
          "::" to front of "DuplicateHandle" so the WinCE compiler
          sees the right function.
          Also added ctor/dtor for ACE_Managed_Process to try and fix the
          can't find vtable error on Linux.

        * ace/Process.h: Added a constructor for ACE_Managed_Process
          to fix "can't find vtable" error on Linux.

        * ace/Process.i: Moved ACE_Managed_Process dtor to .cpp file.

Thu Aug 16 15:10:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.h (pass_handle): Clarify comments for this method.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Process.(h i): Moved the ACE_Managed_Process class out
          of Process_Manager.cpp, exposing it for general use.

Thu Aug 16 10:34:20 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp (allocate_aio_slot): Added a fix so that
          the POSIX Proactor compiles with FreeBSD 4.4.  Thanks to Yev
          Omenzel <omenzel@yahoo.com> for reporting this and to Craig
          Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com> for fixing it and to
          John E Hein <jhein@timing.com> for fixing the fix ;-)

Thu Aug 16 08:09:53 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Added the OTHER requirement to the Thread_Pool_Reactor_Test and
          the Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.  These are only built if
          OTHER is part of the ACE components list.


Wed Aug 15 15:50:38 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp: Don't try to purge the notifications if
          notify_handler_ is 0.  Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edanayal@hotmail.com> for reporting this.

Wed Aug 15 11:33:26 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst:
          Remove one build from the list, the machine is being retargeted
          for performance testing.

Wed Aug 15 11:10:22 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Added $(VDIR) for
          OBJDIRS. This prevents hardcoding the value of OBJDIRS. This has
          been tested for a dynamic and a static library on Linux. If
          there are other platforms that gives problems, please feel free
          to revert the changes to the version 4.114 of the file.

Wed Aug 15 09:35:19 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Dirent_Test.cpp:

          Added #define's for VXWORKS that allow this test to function
          properly.  Avoid hard-coded relative paths that may not exist on
          VxWorks.

Wed Aug 15 09:08:40 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:

          Added an implementation to ACE_Sock_Connect::get_ip_interfaces().
          With this, the Enum_Interfaces_Test works correctly.

Wed Aug 15 07:54:49 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Unravelled the mystery a
          bit. The patch that was applied to remove the hard coding of
          OBJDIRS seems to be the problem. The OBJDIRS has been hardcoded
          again. This should fix the problems that we have been seeing in
          the builds.  If at all we need to remove hardcoding the OBJDIRS,
          we either need to put the value of VDIR or VSHDIR. If we put
          both we are going to end up with duplicate targets. Now the
          killer, what do we add to the OBJDIRS? Me thinks it is VDIR. I
          have test that out else I would be breaking builds again.

Wed Aug 15 07:30:00 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Reverted the change "Tue
          Aug 14 21:42:24 2001  Balachandran Natarajan". Thought that was a
          typo. But looks like it is not.

Wed Aug 15 06:39:50 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process.cpp: Fixed a warning with g++.

Tue Aug 14 23:57:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * A set of changes to encapsulate passing handles to spawned
          processes. Thanks very much to Eamonn Saunders
          <Esaunders@softricity.com> for suggesting that this could work
          and pointing out the Win32 details!

        * THANKS: Added Eamonn Saunders to the Hall of Fame

        * ace/Handle_Set.h: Replace include ace/ACE.h with ace/OS.h. This
          class is part of the OS subset.

        * ace/Process.h: Added the following methods:
          - ACE_Process_Options::pass_handle (ACE_HANDLE). Cause the specified
            handle to be passed to a child process when it's spawned. Has
            meaning mainly for Win32. The handle value will be included
            in the spawned process's command line as +H <handle>. The passed
            handle value will be duplicated if on Win32 less than NT4.

          - ACE_Process_Options::dup_handles (ACE_Handle_Set set) const
            Get a copy of the handles the ACE_Process_Options duplicated
            for the spawned process.

          - ACE_Process_Options::passed_handles (ACE_Handle_Set set) const
            Get a copy of the handles passed to the spawned process. This
            will be the set of handles previously passed to pass_handle().

          - ACE_Process::close_dup_handles (). Close all the handles in
            the set obtained from ACE_Process_Options::dup_handles.

          - ACE_Process::close_passed_handles (). Close all the handles in
            the set obtained from ACE_Process_Options::passed_handles.

          Also moved the avoid_zombies() functions and flag out of the
          non-Win32 section - it can safely be ignored, maintain the
          intended semantics, and help apps stay portable.

        * Process.cpp: Implement the above new methods. Also, after spawning
          a process, the parent will call the above dup_handles/passed_handles
          methods to get any passed handles. The close_*_handles() methods
          can then close them. Also, the destructor will call close_dup_handles
          to be sure that no handles leak on Win32 less than NT4.

        * Process.i (command_line_buf ()): Added a new arg to receive the
          maximum length of the buffer pointed to on return. To maintain
          backward compatibility, the arg defaults to 0 (don't return
          the max length).

        * ace/Makefile: Moved Handle_Set from the UTILS group to the OS group.

        * ace/ace.icc: Moved Handle_Set from DEMUX to OS.

        * docs/ACE-subsets.html: Move Handle_Set from DEMUX to OS.

Tue Aug 14 21:42:24 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Fixed a typo.

Tue Aug 14 21:30:04 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Makefile: Removed JAWS2 and JAWS from the Makefile. There
          are several reasons for reverting. This breaks the builds. The
          Makefiles in the recursed directories are all messed up. The
          library dependencies doesnt seem trivial. Nobody may have time
          to fix this. Further, our daily builds return too quickly and we
          just needed more files to compile :-).

Tue Aug 14 14:19:49 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.i (ACE_Local_Memory_Pool dtor): Call release()
          here to free up the blocks allocated by the pool, else they're
          stranded and can't be freed.

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp (ACE_Local_Memory_Pool::release): After
          freeing up the blocks, reset the allocated_chunks_ set to be
          sure they are also freed, and the chunks can't be freed again.

Tue Aug 14 14:19:37 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Applied the patches sent by Tibor Kiss
          <tkiss@mindmaker.hu> for ACE_Log_Msg::close ()

Tue Aug 14 13:55:42 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx.GNU: Added a patch from John
          Michael Zorko  <j.zorko@att.net>.

Tue Aug 14 10:21:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h: Clarified the defaults for the per-process and
          per-instance default priority masks.

Mon Aug 13 14:01:35 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Fixed some hard-coded
          uses of .shobj and .obj.  Thanks to Shashi Bhushan
          <Shashi.Bhushan@lmco.com> for contributing these.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h: Added comments warning about the deletarious
          effects of not aligning buffers to ACE_InputCDR and
          ACE_OutputCDR properly.  Thanks to Alain Decamps
          <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for reporting this.

Sun Aug 12 14:46:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (sched_params): Make sure to set errno for Win32 so
          that callers can figure out what's going wrong in a consistent
          way.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.i (purge_pending_notifications): Don't
          try to purge the notifications if notify_handler_ is 0.  thanks
          to Steve Rahn <SRahn@rim.net> for reporting this.

Mon Aug 13 20:09:04 2001  Balachandran  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.1.19 released.

Sun Aug 12 02:17:01 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_Connector.cpp: On non-Win32 platforms, disable
          multithreaded MEM_IO if _ACE_USE_SV_SEM is defined.

Sun Aug 12 01:27:51 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp: Correct const-ness of a pointer
          retrieved from ACE_Log_Record::msg_data().

Sun Aug 12 00:34:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Record.h:
        * ace/Log_Record.i (msg_data()): Changed ACE_TCHAR *msg_data()
          to:  const ACE_TCHAR *msg_data (void) const. Makes it safer,
          and conforms to all current usage inside ACE. Also makes
          C++ Network Programming examples simpler :-)

Sat Aug 11 09:01:11 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread.h:
        * ace/Task.h: Added a list of other flags that can be passed to
          activate().

Fri Aug 10 19:39:48 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

          Disabled the Blocking_Sync_None test from running under Tru64.
          Also changed the config parameter passed to the auto_compile
          script from TRU_64 to Tru64 in
               ~bugzilla/bin/auto_compile_tru64_cxx.

          This is so that the test is disabled only for the WashU builds.
          The reason being that Bala was not too happy with changing the
          default values for all the platforms and we also wanted to avoid
          more #ifdefs in the code. Other builds might have better values
          and the test might succeed. Have to confirm this though.

Fri Aug 10 17:59:47 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/OS.h: Added /**/ between #include and <sys/modem.h> and
          <alloca.h> to avoid warning from CE compiler.

        * ace/ace_dll.vcp: Added Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.* to the project.

Fri Aug 10 13:40:46 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst:

          I didn't realize the LIST definition was needed.  I have
          added it for the Tru64 4.0f Compaq C++ 6.3-10 build.

Fri Aug 10 11:45:03 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst:

          Added the Tru64 4.0f Compaq C++ 6.3-10 build.

Fri Aug 10 11:06:23 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * apps/drwho/CM_Client.cpp:
        * apps/drwho/CM_Server.cpp:
        * apps/drwho/server.cpp:

          Changes to avoid warnings on HP-UX with aCC.

Thu Aug  9 16:56:05 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.i:
        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.cpp: We seem to be re-inventing wheels
          again and again.  A few months back we had a show stopper in a
          beta which was caused by usage of static cast. The cast was not
          to the liking of SunCC 4.2. Looks like we had to change a bunch
          of static cast sprayed in these two files to a C style cast as
          4.2 doesnt like them. Compilers like Borland handle these
          better, but not 4.2.

Thu Aug  9 11:51:10 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: On popular mandate we
          have the -w flag removed from CCFLAGS in the above file. Looks
          like the -w disables lots of warnings that may be useful.

Thu Aug  9 11:41:01 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h (ACE_OutputCDR): Fixed the ambigous constructor
          problem. The InputCDR class had two constructors which were
          similar if the default values for the arguments were
          exercised. Thanks to Torbjorn Backstrom
          <torbjorn.k.backstrom@volvo.com> for reporting this.

Thu Aug  9 12:31:21 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_String.cpp (strtok_r_emulation): Make sure to check
          for a NULL return from strtok() before calling strlen()!  Thanks
          to Boris Sukholitko <boriss@richfx.com> for reporting this.

Wed Aug 08 21:27:50 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst (Debian_Wchar, Debian_GCC_3.0):

          The host these nightly builds were built on is now called
          "rumba" (previously "valinor").  Updated the build list
          accordingly.

Wed Aug 08 21:19:09 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.UTF-16.conf:

          Removed extraneous characters from this file that were causing
          the Service Configurator's underlying lexer to "choke."

Wed Aug  8 16:23:31 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:
          Add the AMI_Buffering tests to the nightly regression testsuite.

Wed Aug  8 16:07:26 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: The GIOP lite tests will not work in the
          static builds. It was  adding more complications to the test
          than what is already there to get it working for the static
          builds.

Wed Aug  8 14:06:36 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-tru64.h:

          Define ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER for all DEC Unix 4.x
          versions.

        * ace/config-cxx-common.h:

          Define ACE_AUTO_PTR_LACKS_RESET if __DECCXX_VER == 60190027.
          Thanks to Robert Burke <c-robert.burke@wcom.com> for reporting
          this.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_3.2.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0_kcc.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0_rcc.GNU:

          Removed the following files.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_3.2_cxx.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.x_cxx.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.x_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.x_kcc.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.x_rcc.GNU:

          Added new versions of the removed files.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_pre.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_post.GNU:

          Moved a lot of duplicated code into these new files.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_cxx.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_kcc.GNU:

          Removed a lot of old *cruft* like setting up compilation with
          cxx when gcc was asked for etc. etc. Somebody went overboard
          with cut'n paste and copied David's changes blindly. Still not
          completely satisfied. But it works and is better than before.
          This also fixes Bug Id 989.

Wed Aug 08 11:30:26 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp (run_test):

          Don't check if "ACE_USES_WCHAR == 1" since some configurations
          neglect to set it an integer value.  Instead, just check if it
          is defined.

Wed Aug  8 12:31:51 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp: Changed a ACE_DEBUG statment with an
          LM_WARNING  to an LM_DEBUG.

Wed Aug 08 11:59:45 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Do not redefine ACE_IOV_MAX if it has already been
          defined.

Wed Aug  8 06:21:24 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Makefile: Moved Message_Block from STREAMS_FILES to
          UTILS_FILES.

        * ace/OS_Dirent.inl (closedir): Changed delete d->directory_name_ to
          delete [] d->directory_name_.  Thanks to Olivier Brunet
          <obrunet@groupama-ccama.tm.fr> for reporting this.

Tue Aug  7 21:59:42 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Svc_Handler_Test.cpp: Modified the test to dump the contents
          of the temporary file to the log file.

Tue Aug  7 19:14:24 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
        * ace/SOCK_Stream.h: Fixed incorrect comments.
          Thanks to Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for reporting
          these.

Tue Aug  7 15:19:38 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace: Changed all uses of IOV_MAX to use the new ACE_IOV_MAX.
        * ace/OS.h: Added a new ACE_IOV_MAX that makes it clear this is
          an ACE-level #define.  We use this in C++NP v1.

Tue Aug  7 14:16:57 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp: Reimplemented the flush() method to use
          the new send_n() method on the various ACE I/O classes.

        * ace/SOCK_Stream.{h,i}:
        * ace/FILE_IO.{h,i}: Added a new send_n() method that sends all
          the <message_block>s chained through their <next> and <cont>
          pointers using the underlying OS gather-write operation to
          reduce the domain-crossing penalty.

Tue Aug  7 17:27:16 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Collection_test.cpp: Fixed a compile error with g++. This
          is a patch that Johnny Willemsen sent as a part of his last
          checkin.

Tue Aug 07 11:25:36 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-freebsd-pthread.h: Made the following definition
          valid only for pre-4.2-RELEASE.

          #define ACE_LACKS_GETPGID
          #define ACE_LACKS_SETPGID
          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREGID
          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREUID

          Thanks to Robert Burke <rburke2002@yahoo.com> for reporting
          this.

Tue Aug 07 16:40:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.*:
          Added const_iterator to the Hash_Map_Manager so that it is
          possible to iterate over a hash map in a const method

          The operator= of the iterator now check the value of this to
          check that the iterator instance is assigned to itself

        * tests/Hash_Map_Manager_Test.cpp
          Extended this test to test the new const_iterator capabilities
          of the hash map

        * ace/Unbounded_Set.cpp:
          Implemented missing operator* for the const iterator

        * tests/Collection_test.cpp:
          Extended test to test the operator* of the
          Unbounded_Set_Const_Iterator

Mon Aug  6 19:58:48 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Added #define for ACE_HAS_TERM_IOCTLS.
          Thanks to Torbjorn Backstrom <torbjorn.k.backstrom@volvo.com>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/OS.h: Added a #include for <sys/modem.h> for HP/UX.  Thanks
          to Torbjorn Backstrom <torbjorn.k.backstrom@volvo.com> for
          reporting this.

Mon Aug  6 12:51:35 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch.h (ACE_Null_Mutex>): Fixed a cut&paste error
          where acquire_write() should be acquire_read().  Thanks to
          Russell Mora <rd.mora@router.econz.co.nz> for fixing this.

Mon Aug 06 17:17:33 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fixed some debugging messages that were not wrapped within an
          ACE_LIB_TEXT macro.

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.UTF-16.conf:

          Interim UTF-16 encoded version of the UTF-8 encoded
          Service_Config_Test.conf.  It was generated on a little-endian
          host.  Its current purpose is simply to keep our Unicode
          regression testing happy until the on-the-fly generation is
          implemented.  Once we start generating this file on-the-fly
          this file should disappear.

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp (run_test):

          When using full Unicode support, use the version of the Service
          Configurator file that is UTF-16 encoded (as described above).

Mon Aug 06 11:10:24 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp:

          More Unicode fixes.  Flex's allocation function uses malloc() as
          its underlying allocator.  Since it only accepts the size in
          bytes, allocate "size * sizeof (ACE_TCHAR)" when allocating
          string buffers.  This should clear up some strange looking text
          "unknown character" messages emanating from the Service
          Configurator's underlying text scanner.

          Note that these changes do not fix the cause of the "unknown
          character."  Those fixes should soon follow.

Mon Aug 06 09:04:04 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.l:

          Unicode updates.  Wrap debugging text within an ACE_LIB_TEXT
          macro.

Sun Aug  5 14:31:10 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_tests.lst: Ossama suggested that we dont run the
          Service_Config_Test in static builds.

Fri Aug 04 3:33:31 2001  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/QoS/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.h:
        * ace/QoS/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.cpp:

          Made the open method public so we can open UDP sockets for
          non-multicast addresses.

Fri Aug 03 22:19:31 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Added ACE_HAS_WCHAR to build in the
          wide char handling since Darrell so nicely straightened all
          the muck out throughout ACE. Thanks Darrell!

Fri Aug 03 22:15:51 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): For 'W' and 'w' on HP-UX, the 'ls' and
          'lc' forms are not allowed; HP-UX requires 'S' and 'C'.

Fri Aug  3 13:10:59 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h (ACE_UINT64_FORMAT_SPECIFIER,
          ACE_SSIZE_T_FORMAT_SPECIFIER, ACE_SIZE_T_FORMAT_SPECIFIER):

          Removed unnecessary and some incorrect format specifiers for the
          32-bit platform case.  In particular, the format specifier for
          an unsigned 64-bit integer was incorrectly set to "%Lu."  "%L"
          is the format specifier for a "long double," not a "long long"
          integer on 32-bit platforms.  "%llu" is the correct format
          specifier which `ace/Basic_Types.h' already defines.

Fri Aug  3 09:55:38 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

          Added the new TAO "DLL_ORB" test to the list of tests to run.

Fri Aug  3 08:26:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/RW_Process_Mutex.cpp: Added a missing comma in the
          constructor. This should fix Win32 compile errors.

Fri Aug  3 08:07:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp: Added a check for a memory allocation failure
          in grow (). Thanks to Francis Paul <FranciP@navcanada.ca> for
          pointing this out.

Thu Aug  2 18:37:23 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/RW_Process_Mutex.cpp: Added ACE_DEFAULT_OPEN_PERMS
          to the constructor call to ACE_RW_Process_Mutex so that it does
          the right thing on Win32.  Thanks to Wayne Erchak
          <werchak@stentor.com> for reporting this.  This fixes
          bugid 996.

Thu Aug 02 13:04:19 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Added Intrusive_List.cpp to the TEMPLATE_FILES
          section.

Thu Aug 02 06:59:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h (ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR): If ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR
          is defined, use sizeof(wchar_t) to set ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR.

Wed Aug  1 16:05:49 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * Merged changes from the fix_886 branch

        Tue Jul 31 09:17:49 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/Intrusive_List.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_List.inl:
          Add new methods to access the head and tail of the list.

        * ace/Intrusive_List.cpp:
          Fixed the implementation of remove(), if the element to be
          removed was the last on the list it wasn't removed at all.
          Left some code to check invariants, have to find a way to keep
          that code around with some optional compilation flags.

        Thu Jul 26 16:50:54 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/Makefile:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * ace/Makefile.bor:
        * ace/Intrusive_List.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_List.inl:
        * ace/Intrusive_List.cpp:
          Add new template to implement intrusive lists, i.e. lists that
          assume their elements implement the next() and prev() methods.

        * ace/Intrusive_List_Node.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_List_Node.inl:
        * ace/Intrusive_List_Node.cpp:
          Helper class to add the requirements of ACE_Intrusive_List to
          any other class, simply do:
          class Foo : public ACE_Intrusive_List_Node<Foo>

Wed Aug  1 15:57:35 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp (release, release_i):

          Obtain the pointer to the allocator from the object that will be
          destroyed before calling ACE_DES_FREE on the object.  Previously
          we were obtaining the allocator after the object was destroyed,
          due to the way the ACE_DES_FREE macro works.  Thanks to Hyman
          Rosen <hyrosen@mail.com> for reporting the problem, and to
          Carlos for suggesting a fix.  [Bug 992]

Wed Aug  1 15:00:21 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Record.{h,i}: Changed msg_data_len() from a "setter"
          to a "getter" method, which makes more sense.  Thanks to Patrick
          Rabau <Patrick.Rabau@htc.com> for reporting this.

Wed Aug  1 12:43:57 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp:

          Reintegreated Nanbor's change (Wed Jun 13 10:22:10 2001  Nanbor
          Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>) that enables proper handling of
          UNICODE Service Configurator directives.

Wed Aug  1 07:14:42 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU: Checked in a new
          version of this file, which includes support for the Hitachi
          chip.  Thanks to Frank Wolf for this.

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp (format_msg): Added a cast to fix a warning.
          Thanks to Bala for reporting this.

Tue Jul 31 22:53:26 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/libService_Config_DLL.icc:

          New Visual Age project file for the libService_Config_DLL
          library.

        * tests/Makefile.am:

          Added build targets/dependencies for the libService_Config_DLL
          library.

Tue Jul 31 22:46:33 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Service_Config_DLL.dsp:
        * tests/Service_Config_Test.dsp:

          Removed the static library configurations.  The
          Service_Config_Test currently requires dynamically loadable
          objects.  Fixes Win32 "LIB" build failures.

Tue Jul 31 22:10:48 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp (run_test):

          Wrap strings passed to ACE_ARGV::add() within an ACE_TEXT
          macro.  Fixes Unicode conversion problems.

Tue Jul 31 16:53:57 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h (ace_yyrestart, ace_yy_delete_parse_buffer,
          ace_yydirective):

          Remove these global function and variable declarations.  They
          are no longer used.

Tue Jul 31 16:43:33 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          If "__LITTLE_ENDIAN__" is defined then assume that the
          architecture is little endian.  Some compilers/platforms define
          that macro.  Suggested by Frank Wolf" <fwolf@gum.de>.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h (yy_push_buffer):
        * ace/Svc_Conf.l (yy_push_buffer):
        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp (ace_yy_push_buffer):
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.cpp (ACE_Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard):
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.h (ACE_Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard):

          The Service Configurator directive is an "ACE_TCHAR *" not a
          "char *".  Updated these method/function parameters to accept
          the former.  Fixes a compile-time problem on "wchar/Unicode"
          builds.

Tue Jul 31 05:34:48 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Removed a spurious WNOHANG definition.  Thanks to
          Christina Junru <junruli@lucent.com> for reporting this.

Mon Jul 30 15:31:42 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h,i,cpp}: Fixed this class so that all of its fields
          are ACE_UINT32 or ACE_INT32 internally so that it'll always be
          the same on all platforms.  Thanks to Fabris
          <fabris65@my-deja.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jul 31 10:22:38 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Makefile:

          Only build the Service_Config_Test if shared libraries are
          enabled, since it attempts to dynamically load a shared
          library.

Tue Jul 31 10:16:31 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dump.h: Clarified the use of ACE_NDEBUG for turning this
          feature off, not on. Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@swan.fr>
          for noticing this.

Mon Jul 30 13:41:00 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (ACE_Time_Value::FILETIME_to_timval_skew): Updated
          docuementation to better explain the meaning of this constant.
          Thanks to Mike Vitalo <mvitalo@sprynet.com> for motivating the
          change.

Mon Jul 30 09:43:06 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (mutex_lock): Missing an argument to the ACE_OSCALL macro.
          Thanks to Bala for reporting this.

Mon Jul 30 05:43:23 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch.h (ACE_Semaphore): Corrected the comment on
          how to get POSIX Pthreads "implementation" of semaphores (which
          supports the timed acquire() option).  Thanks to Grzegorz
          Sikora <GSikora1@era.pl> for reporting this.

Sun Jul 29 19:03:56 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thread_Mutex_Test.cpp (test): Fixed this test to be
          consistent wrt the errno for the timed acquire(), which should
          now always be set to ETIME rather than ETIMEDOUT and EBUSY.

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp (wait_not_full_cond,
          wait_not_empty_cond): Fixed a nasty bug with the semaphore
          version of ACE_Message_Queue that would have reared it's ugly
          head if ACE_NULL_SYNCH were used when
          ACE_HAS_OPTIMIZED_MESSAGE_QUEUE was enabled.  Fixing this bug
          also triggered the following changes.

        * ace/OS.{h,i}: Added support for ACE_OS::sema_wait(),
          ACE_OS::mutex_lock(), ACE_OS::thread_mutex_lock() that take
          ACE_Time_Value *.

        * ace/OS.i: For some odd reason the timeouts for the timed version
          of mutex_lock() were returning a random smattering of errnos.
          I've changed them to all be consistent with the
          ACE_Condition_Thread_Mutex::wait() errno, which is ETIME.

        * ace/Synch.h: Updated the documentation of all the timed
          acquire() methods to explain what the various return values
          mean.

Sun Jul 29 22:10:40 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Service_Config_DLL.cpp:
        * tests/Service_Config_DLL.h:
        * tests/Service_Config_DLL.dsp:
        * tests/Service_Config_DLL_Export.h:
        * tests/Service_Config_Test.conf:

          New files associated with the existing Service_Config_Test.
          They are used when testing the reentrance/thread-safety of the
          Service Configurator, in addition to testing the Service
          Configurator's ability to handle nested processing of Service
          Configurator directives.

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp (run_test):

          Add arguments to the Service Configurator argument vector to
          make it process the newly added `Service_Config_Test.conf'
          file.

          (main):

          Make the ACE_Thread_Manager wait for all running threads before
          exiting the test.  Processing the `Service_Config_Test.conf'
          file causes some threads to be spawned.

Sun Jul 29 19:19:20 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (process_directive, process_directives):

          Wrap the ACE_GUARD_RETURN macro within an ACE_MT block.  The
          ACE_Static_Object_Lock declaration is only visible if
          ACE_HAS_THREADS is defined.  This truly fixes the
          single-threaded build problems.

Sun Jul 29 19:06:11 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y (ace_obstack):
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp:

          UNICODE updates and fixes.

Sun Jul 29 10:50:45 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.cpp:

          There is no longer any need to include "ace/Object_Manager.h"

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Include "ace/Object_Manager.h" to pull in the definition of
          ACE_Static_Object_Lock.  Fixes a problem found in Sun builds and
          single-threaded builds.

Sat Jul 28 23:03:24 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        The following are changes that make the Service Configurator
        reentrant and thread-safe.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:

          Generate a pure (reentrant) parser using Bison.  BYACC doesn't
          support generation of reentrant parsers.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.l:

          Implemented "buffer stack" support.  This feature makes it
          possible to process Service Configurator directives within a
          Service Object's init() method, i.e. support nested directive
          processing.

          (ace_yyerrno):

          Moved declaration of ace_yyerrno from this file to
          `Svc_Conf.y'.  ace_yyerrno was not used in the generated
          scanner.  It was only used in the generated parser.

          (yy_delete_parse_buffer):

          There is no longer any need for this function.  The lexer buffer
          stack implementation handles memory management of lexer buffers.

          (yywrap):

          Do not call yy_delete_parse_buffer().  It is no longer necessary
          to do so, in addition to the fact that that function was
          removed (as described above).

          (<<EOF>>):

          Do not call ACE_YY_NEW_FILE in this rule.  The new buffer stack
          implementation handles the buffer switching that ACE_YY_NEW_FILE
          did, and more.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Regenerated these files using updated Bison/YACC and FLEX input
          files to pull in support for reentrant parsing and nested
          processing of Service Configurator directives.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h (ace_yy_push_buffer, ace_yy_pop_buffer):

          Added function prototypes for the newly implemented lexer buffer
          stack manipulation functions.

          (ace_yylex):

          Added ACE_YYSTYPE parameter to this functions signature, as
          required by the new reentrant parser support.

          (ACE_SERVICE_DIRECTIVE_STACK_DEPTH):

          New symbolic constant that defines the maximum supported depth
          for nested Service Configurator processing.  The current default
          is 8.

          (ACE_YY_INPUT):

          No longer any need to redefine this macro to support scanning of
          Service Configurator directive strings.  The new lexer buffer
          stack implementation provides support for lexer buffer scanning
          from a string instead of a pointer to "FILE."

          (ace_yydirective):

          This global variable is no longer needed due to the fact that
          the new buffer stack implementation handles directives read from
          both a string and a file.

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          (process_directive, process_directives):

          Obtain a recursive lock before manipulating the lexer buffer
          stack, and invoking the parser and scanner.  This makes
          invocation of the scanner thread-safe.

          The new lexer buffer stack implemenation obviates the need to
          call yyrestart() since buffer switching is handled by the stack
          implementation.

          (open_i, close):

          No need to deallocate the lexer buffer since the buffer stack
          implementation handles that.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.cpp:

          New "guard" class that makes lexer buffer stack pushing and
          popping exception-safe.

        * ace/Makefile:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * ace/Makefile.bor:
        * ace/ace.icc:
        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:

          Added Svc_Conf_Lexer_Guard.* sources to these Makefiles and
          project files.

Sat Jul 28 14:58:30 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp: Reran BYACC and FLEX on the Svc_Conf.l and
          Svc_Conf.y files to regenerate them.  Thanks to Bala for
          motivating this.

        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/collection/Makefile,
          netsvcs/clients/Tokens/deadlock/Makefile,
          netsvcs/clients/Tokens/invariant/Makefile,
          netsvcs/clients/Tokens/mutex/Makefile,
          netsvcs/clients/Tokens/rw_lock/Makefile,
          examples/ASX/CCM_App/Makefile,
          examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/Makefile,
          examples/Reactor/Multicast/Makefile,
          examples/Reactor/Ntalker/Makefile,
          examples/Shared_Malloc/Makefile,
          performance-tests/TCP/Makefile,
          performance-tests/UDP/Makefile: Removed the line
          include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/rules.LIB.GNU
          so that these projects will build correctly on VxWorks with
          Make 3.79.1.  Thanks to Frank Wolf for reporting this.

Fri Jul 27 11:24:50 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y: Allow quoted strings as the pathname.  Thanks
          to Kevin Burge <kcburge@systemware-inc.com> for suggesting this
          and providing the fix.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.l: Added support for "~" in pathnames to support
          Win32isms.  Thanks to Kevin Burge <kcburge@systemware-inc.com>
          for suggesting this and providing the fix.

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.i (assign): Fixed the code to avoid a
          race condition.  Thanks to Charlie Duke for this fix.

Thu Jul 26 08:15:36 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU: Changed
          $PATH to $(PATH).  Thanks to Frank Wolf for reporting this.

Wed Jul 25 17:46:58 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Asynch_Acceptor.{h,cpp}: Added an asynch_accept() accessor
          method.  Thanks to Craig L. Ching <cching@mqsoftware.com> for
          reporting this.

Wed Jul 25 17:36:09 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.i: Added a lock for the reference count
          to the assign() method.  Thanks to Charlie Duke
          <cduke@cuseeme.com> for reporting this.

Fri Jul 27 23:17:31 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace_wchar.h: If ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR is set, then
          also set up definitions for functions that are not present
          (ACE_LACKS_ITOW, ACE_LACKS_WCSICMP, ACE_LACKS_WCSNICMP,
          ACE_LACKS_WCSDUP).

        * ace/ace_wchar.inl: If not ACE_WIN32, include <string.h> to see
          strlen().

        * ace/OS_String.inl (strstr): The XPG4 multibyte version of
          strstr() is wcswcs(), whereas the ANSI C / UNIX98 version is
          wcsstr(). So if ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR is defined, use
          wcswcs.

Fri Jul 27 21:52:48 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added the IDL_Cubut test with GIOP Lite
          script, to our daily builds.

Fri Jul 27 16:50:49 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp: Silence a compile warning in g++.

Fri Jul 27 12:18:49 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed compile error - missing "" around
          's' for the %S case.

Fri Jul 27 11:07:26 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS.h:

          After conversation with Steve Huston, I am reverting his change
          pertaining to HPUX from "Tue Jul 10 18:15:39 2001  Steve Huston
          <shuston@riverace.com>".

Fri Jul 27 10:57:24 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp:

          Fix the ACE_SOCK_Dgram_Bcast::mk_broadcast() which was completely
          broken on AIX.  The broadcast_client in docs/tutorials/008 now
          works with the help of this change.

Thu Jul 26 22:09:19 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Extend behavior so that all printf
          formatting conversion specifiers can be used with all legal
          ACE_Log_Msg format characters. This allows the caller to line
          up columns on any field, like line number or program name, or
          thread ID. Thanks to Paul Caffrey <pcaffrey@iel.ie> for
          motivating this extension.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp: Added a new function, test_format_specs,
          that verifies the formatting. Right now it does not detect the
          correctness of the strings produced - they have to be examined
          in the log file to check. This needs to be fixed still.

Thu Jul 26 11:48:16 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/count_lines:
          Add a few new file types.

Wed Jul 25 23:49:43 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_g++.GNU:

          Fixed some missing defines in the Makefile for DEC Unix versions
          4.0D, 4.0E. We don't support or suggest this combination. Hence
          the oversight in missing the needed defines.

          Thanks to Martin Krumpolec <krumpo@pobox.sk> for reporting this.

Wed Jul 25 23:49:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Remove extraneous rapi = 0.

Wed Jul 25 18:53:18 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * html/index.html:

          Added CORBA Security Service main page link to the list of
          documentation.

Wed Jul 25 17:41:43 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ltcf-c.sh:
        * ltcf-cxx.sh:
        * ltconfig:

          Removed these libtool related files.  New versions of libtool
          (GNU libtool >= 1.4b) no longer use them.

        * config.guess:
        * config.sub:
        * ltmain.sh:

          Removed these files.  We no longer need to keep custom copies
          lieing around since libtool 1.4b includes all of our local
          changes (i.e. our changes have been folded into the upstream
          libtool sources).

        * install-sh:
        * missing:
        * mkinstalldirs:

          Removed these files.  Automake will automatically add these when
          necessary.

Wed Jul 25 16:29:48 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.cpp: ACE-ified the code and fixed
          a number of ACE_DEBUG %p directives without a corresponding
          string. Also, closed a 2 handle-per-try handle leak, which
          may have affected test results on some platforms.
        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.h: Added a destructor to the
          test class - it's used to close the acceptor handle down.

Wed Jul 25 15:21:22 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          Fixed the _XOPEN_SOURCE checking to _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500 to fix
          incorrect declaration of prototype. This fixes the warnings when
          compiling with gcc-3.0. Thanks to Ossama for suggesting the fix.

Wed Jul 25 08:05:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.h:
        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.cpp: Fixed a subtle race
          condition. This hardly showed up in many of our daily
          builds. The race condition had to be fixed to show the users of
          the cautious approach that one needs to take if they are
          resuming the handle in the application itself.

Tue Jul 24 16:41:57 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp :
          Added "&& ! defined (ACE_HAS_PACE)" ifdefs to already existing
          #if defined (VXWORKS) sections of code to get ACE_HAS_PACE to
          compile on VxWorks.

        * ace/OS.i :
        * ace/OS.cpp:
          Fixed formatting of some comments and added needed PACE
          calls for ACE_HAS_PACE on VxWorks.

        * ace/OS.h :
          Put #if !defined guards around the ACE_THR_PRI* macros
          so that we can define them in the config*.h files if
          they need to be corrected. For instance, ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_MIN
          has a different value on SunOS 5.8 than it does on SunOS 5.7,
          i.e., -20 vs. 0 respectively.

          Also, added some needed typedefs and #define for ACE_HAS_PACE
          on VxWorks and updated some comments concerning ACE_OS::thr_create
          flags.

        * ace/Sched_Params.cpp (priority_min, priority_max):
          Changed to return correct thread priority min/max for
          Solaris threads. We now use the ACE_PRI_THR* macros
          for these values while still calling ACE_OS::priority_control
          for process and LWP priorities.

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
          Added setting of ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_MIN to be correct
          for SunOS 5.8.

Tue Jul 24 13:47:32 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h (ACE_SSL_Asynch_Stream):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp: Added a open () method that
          matches the signature of ACE_Service_Handler. This should fix
          the warnings in Borland builds that complain about hiding
          the virtual functions.

Tue Jul 24 10:56:04 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/generate_doxygen.pl (TAO_DOCS):

          Added "tao_security" and "tao_ssliop" Doxygen configurations to
          the list of documentation to generate.

Tue Jul 24 07:45:03 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T: Fixed some problems with the lack of
          const for the ACE_DLList and ACE_Double_Linked_List classes.
          Thanks to Michael Kircher for reporting this.

        * ace/config-cygwin32-common.h: Removed the ACE_LACKS_FORK
          macro since this is apparently working on Cygwin.  Thanks tj
          Stefan Kluehspies <Stefan.Kluehspies@gmx.net> for reporting
          this.

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h: Removed the #define _CLOCKID_T
          macro, which should now be handled by the following change.

        * ace/OS.h: Added a #defined for _CLOCKID_T_.  Thanks to
          Stefan Kluehspies <Stefan.Kluehspies@gmx.net> for
          reporting this.

Tue Jul 24 11:10:59 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          Fix the compile errors seen on gcc-3.0 with -pedantic and
          -Wno-long-long. This should fix all the errors.

Tue Jul 24 10:07:31 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:

          Add an optimize override to 0 for g++ 3.0.  The compiler breaks on
          a tremendous amount of files, even with -O.

Tue Jul 24 10:04:52 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:

          Corrected a run-time error on Tru64 with gcc.  Any executable
          that called ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_name() would core dump.
          This was caused by the call to ACE_OS::gethostbyaddr_r().

Tue Jul 24 08:20:02 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:

          Change -O2 to -O.  The optimizer seems to be a tiny
          bit broken, which is demonstrated by a few TAO and orbsvcs
          tests.

Mon Jul 23 17:38:46 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * etc/tao_security.doxygen:
        * etc/tao_ssliop.doxygen:

          New Doxygen files for TAO's CORBA security libraries.

Mon Jul 23 13:48:26 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/MEM_Connector.cpp (connect):

          Disable non-blocking on the stream after its handle has been
          set.  Previously, non-blocking was disabled on an uninitialized
          MEM_Stream, after which the handle was set (i.e. initializing
          the stream).  In order to properly disable non-blocking on a
          stream, its handle must be set first since ioctl() operations
          are typically performed on the underlying stream handle.

Mon Jul 23 13:06:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (event_handling): Corrected the loop check
          to account for a zero ACE_Time_Value *, avoiding a crash in
          tests/Reactor_Timer_Test, as well as any other program that
          called ACE_Reactor::handle_events with a zero timer pointer.

Mon Jul 23 10:39:55 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Added /**/ between #include and <sys/times.h> to
          avoid warning from CE compiler.

        * ace/ace_dll.vcp: Added Obchunk.cpp to the project.

Sun Jul 22 08:19:43 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h: ADded a #define for_CLOCKID_T.  Thanks to
          Christophe Galerne <christophgalerne@earthlink.net> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp (priority_names_): Added commas after the
          'ACE_LIB_TEXT ("LM_UNK(04000)")' lines.  Thanks to Steve Harris
          <harris_s@ociweb.com> for reporting this.

Sat Jul 21 19:56:08 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Map_T.{h,i}: Made current_value() a const member function.
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Fri Jul 20 10:16:46 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Connector.cpp (create_AST): Replaced some calls to
          sh->get_handle () with a cached value of handle.  This fixes a
          bug with gcc 2.96 on Tornado 2.1/VxWorks for SuperH.  Thanks to
          Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de> for reporting this.

        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-acceptor.cpp:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_Thr_Stream.cpp:
        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.cpp:  Changed the
          SH macro to SVH to avoid clashes with a macro in VxWorks.
          Thanks to Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de> for reporting this.

Thu Jul 19 06:55:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-g++-common.h: Version 2.96 of g++ on VxWorks
          is missing auto_ptr, so let's add the ACE_LACK_AUTO_PTR flag
          there.  Thanks to Frank Wolf for suggesting this.

Fri Jul 20 09:47:38 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Fixed WinCE errors.  CE does not support
          UNIX_Syslog.

Thu Jul 19 22:39:32 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_IO.h:
        * ace/MEM_IO.i:
        * ace/MEM_IO.cpp: On non-Win32 platforms, disable multithreaded
          MEM_IO if _ACE_USE_SV_SEM is defined.

Thu Jul 19 15:25:11 2001  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.i (mmap_prefix):

          Fix case where a null pointer is passed in.

Thu Jul 19 06:55:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Connector.cpp (connect_svc_handler): Missed one change...
          Thanks to Bala for reporting this!

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU (HOST_DIR): Added
           support for the SH7700 and SH7700LE.  Thanks to Frank Wolf
          <WolfF@Becker.de> for reporting this.

        * ace/OS.i (truncate): Make sure to close the handle that we
          opens.  Thanks to Lothar for reporting this.

        * ace/Connector.cpp: Changed the SH macro to SVH to avoid clashes
          with a macro in VxWorks.  Thanks to Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de>
          for reporting this.

Wed Jul 18 13:15:06 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp (scandir_emulation): Removed the calls to the
          ACE_ERROR_RETURN macros to avoid dependencies on ACE_Log_Msg
          from within the ACE_OS layer.  Thanks to Bala for pointing this
          out!

        * ace/ACE.{h,cpp}: Added a new wrapper method for ACE_OS::select()
          that uses ACE_Handle_Set *'s rather than fd_set *'s.  This is
          motivated by work Steve Huston and I are doing on our new book
          "C++ Network Programming: Resolving Complexity with ACE and
          Patterns."

        * ace/Malloc_T.i (release): Removed an unnecessary "else" to
          make gcc 2.96 happy.  Thanks to Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de> for
          reporting this.

        * Happy birthday to me and Angelo Corsaro!

Tue Jul 17 00:34:40 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SString.h (ACE_Tokenizer): Make sure that the data members
          are protected, not private...  Thanks to Martin Krumpolec for
          reporting this (again)!

Wed Jul 18 16:40:56 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (program_name): Undid the following changes:

          ChangeLogTag:Tue Jul 10 11:32:26 2001  Tibor Kiss

          Tibor will be looking into this further since this change
          currently causes shutdown problems on Win2000.

Wed Jul 18 15:59:03 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-tru64.h:

          Removed _LIBC_POLLUTION_H. It seems that this macro is causing
          problems for some users.  Thanks to Pierre Oberson
          <oberson@nagra-kudelski.ch> for prompting this fix.

Tue Jul 17 13:00:11 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Enabled the MEM_Stream test on Linux.

Mon Jul 16 14:59:32 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.h (ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool): Added a comment
          that discourages developer from using the ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool
          and points them to the ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool instead.  Thanks to
          Johnny Chen <jchen@huawei.com> for motivating this.

        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp (readdir_emulation): Fixed a handle leak
          in the event that errors occur.  Thanks to Kevin Burge
          <kcburge@systemware-inc.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp (open): Add an ACE_const_cast()
          to the program name for platforms like LynxOS whose openlog()
          method is char * rather than const char *.  Thanks to Bala for
          reporting this.

Sun Jul 15 11:06:33 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log.cpp: Fixed the implementation so that
          it's consistent with the new program_name() features.  Thanks to
          Chris Kohloff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for this fix.

Sun Jul 15 11:04:26 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL.dsp:
          Removed references to $OPENSSL_ROOT, the user should configure
          those in the Tools -> Option -> Directories tab.

Fri Jul 13 23:02:46 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp:

          Only support asynchronous SSL streams when using OpenSSL >
          0.9.5a.  The BIO method signatures changed in OpenSSL 0.9.6.

Fri Jul 13 22:48:56 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp (methods_ACE):

          Removed excess element in aggregate initializer.

Fri Jul 13 22:29:01 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp (print_error):

          The OpenSSL ERR_error_string_n() function is only supported in
          OpenSSL 0.9.6 or better.

Fri Jul 13 14:59:18 2001  Alexander Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h (ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Result):
        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (set_error, set_bytes_transferred):

          Added new methods set_error() and set_bytes_transferred().
          Needed for below changes and new asynchronous SSL stream
          implementation.

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.cpp (handle_events):

          Fixed error handling semantics so that it is consistent with the
          POSIX Proactor error handling semantics.

          (post_completion):

          Pass the amount of bytes transferred and the completion key to
          the Win32 PostQueuedCompletionStatus() function.  The error, if
          any, will later be extracted in the handle_events() method.

Fri Jul 13 15:59:45 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/servers/main.cpp (main): The server was always outputing
          LM_DEBUG information, even when the program was not run with the
          -d command line argument.  Therefore, changed the following
          lines from:

          if (ACE::debug () == 0)
            ACE_Log_Msg::disable_debug_messages ();

          to:

          if (ACE::debug () == 0)
            ACE_LOG_MSG->priority_mask (~LM_DEBUG, ACE_Log_Msg::PROCESS);

          Thanks to Jerry D. De Master <jdemaster@rite-solutions.com> for
          reporting this fix.

Fri Jul 13 12:16:03 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp:

          New asynchrounous SSL stream implementation contributed by
          Alexander Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com>.

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL.dsp:
        * ace/SSL/Makefile:
        * ace/SSL/Makefile.bor:

          Added new asynchronous SSL stream source files to these
          Makefiles and project files.

Fri Jul 13 09:40:08 2001  Jerry D. De Master <jdemaster@rite-solutions.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.*,
          ace/Logging_Strategy.*,
          ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.*:
          Applied patches to ACE_Log_Msg, ACE_Logging_Strategy, and
          ACE_Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog that are required to add the program
          name logging strategy option ('n') and to initialize the UNIX
          syslog facility with the program name.  Also included are Boris
          Kolpackov <bosk@ipmce.ru> patches for ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_TOTALLY
          to ACE_Logging_Strategy.

Thu Jul 12 19:54:27 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * examples/Registry/test_registry_update.cpp (main):

          Fixed unused argument warning.

Thu Jul 12 19:57:12 2001  Frank Hunleth  <fhunleth@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

          Added TAO/tests/RTCORBA/ORB_init to the auto run list.

Thu Jul 12 17:11:35 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst (WEB):

          Temporarily removed the IA-64 build till some issues get sorted
          out.

Thu Jul 12 06:01:03 2001  John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net>

        * netsvcs/lib/Server_Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Added an an additional #define in config-macosx.h called
          ACE_HAS_MACOSX_DYLIB, and checked to see if this was _not_
          defined before instantiating the offending template in
          Server_Logging_Handler.cpp.  OS X has this thing about .dylibs
          (OS X version of .so) where they can't have any duplicate
          symbols, which is why libnetsvcs wasn't building on OS X
          earlier.  This fixes that.

        * include/makeincludes/platform-macosx.GNU: Added -lACE to the
          LIBS line, which fixed the majority of the build problems.

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Added the ACE_HAS_MACOSX_DYLIB #define
          mentioned above.

Thu Jul 12 06:01:03 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TLI_Connector.cpp (complete): Changed ACE_OS::t_rcvconnect()
          to simply t_rcvconnect().  Thansk to Andreas Geisler for
          reporting this.

Thu Jul 12 09:43:36 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/FILE_Connector.h (ACE_FILE_Connector, connect):

          Removed the default O_EXCL flag I added a few days ago.  It is
          mostly useful for preventing symbolic link attacks in a
          directory with global write permissions.  Pass the
          responsibility of using the O_EXCL flag when necessary on to the
          application developer.

Wed Jul 11 22:31:50 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU (clean.local):

          Added ti_files to remove the template cache generated by KCC.

        * ace/TLI_Acceptor.cpp(open_new_endpoint):

          Fixed a small typo causing compilation errors under Tru64.

Wed Jul 11 13:06:33 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp: Changed the ostream test to close the
          under-test ostream file before trying to open it and read the
          contents. Avoids the "already open" error now that
          ACE_FILE_Connector includes O_EXCL by default, and avoids any
          potential file buffering issues reading an already-open file.

Wed Jul 11 08:31:02 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:

          Wrapped a string literal with ACE_TEXT, to get rid of a Win2000
          WChar build error.

Wed Jul 11 06:41:43 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TLI_Stream.cpp,
        * ace/TLI_Connector.cpp,
        * ace/TLI_Acceptor.cpp: Added enhancements so that the code would
          work on Win32.  Thanks to Andreas Geisler
          <Andreas.Geisler@erl9.siemens.de> for reporting this.

Tue Jul 10 19:26:15 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

          Disabled generation of source browse information.  It was
          causing problems on some existing builds that didn't use it.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):

          Removed certificate verification code.  It is up to the
          application, not the ACE_SSL library, to perform proper
          certificate verification.

Tue Jul 10 23:02:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:
          Fix test so it doesn't open output file to write to twice.
          Thanks to Ossama for finding it.

Tue Jul 10 19:10:19 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Corrected the mis-applied patch for ace.icc in
          Mon Jul 09 19:12:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Tue Jul 10 16:01:52 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Sangeetha Ramadurai <Sangeetha.Ramadurai@geind.ge.com> to
          the hall of fame.

Tue Jul 10 18:15:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (event_handling): Move the logic for
          noticing that the wait timed out, but did not expire any
          timers, into this function. Will remove it from Reactor.cpp,
          to properly move the fix into handle_events() rather than
          needing to call run_reactor_event_loop to get it right.
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp - still need to add similar logic here.

        * ace/config-sunos5.6.h: Re the following:
          Mon Jul  2 15:26:32 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>
          Replaced ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM, and left ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM out.
          Solaris does indeed have POSIX semaphores in 2.6 and later, but
          requires the changes to OS.i below to work right.

        * ace/OS.h: For ACE_PROC_PRI_OTHER_MIN (and MAX), on HP-UX,
          convert the HP-UX priority value to the POSIX range.

        * ace/OS.i (ACE_OS::sema_init, named POSIX semaphore): On Solaris
          and HP-UX, the name of a POSIX semaphore needs to start with
          a slash (further restricted on Solaris). Enforce that here by
          prepending a slash, or by chopping off parts of the name.

Tue Jul 10 16:08:04 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:

          Fixed the default flags so that it enables the user to override
          settings. Now that the long pending fix to wrapper_macros.GNU is
          through, this should work fine now.

Tue Jul 10 13:37:31 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp (readdir_emulation):

          Removed the hard cast to char* of one of the two arguments in
          a call to strcpy. In the WChar win32 build, this cast was
          causing the source and target strings to be of different widths.

Tue Jul 10 11:32:26 2001  Tibor Kiss  <tkiss@mindmaker.hu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Completed the ACE_Log_Msg::close method with the
          ACE_Thread::keyfree (log_msg_tss_key_) and key_created_ = 0; to
          ensure restartability by multiple successive ACE::init and
          ACE::fini calls.  This fix prevent leaks from occurring when
          ACE::init() and ACE::fini() are called multiple times.

Tue Jul 10 11:12:00 2001  Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.{h, inl}: refactored XDIR, dirent usage for pSOS -
          user is no longer responsible for buffer deallocation after each
          readdir call, only for passing the pointer returned from opendir
          into closedir when all done.  ACE_DIR structure is now used
          consistently for all pSOS dirent calls.

Tue Jul 10 06:06:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Repository.h: Updated the insert() comment to
          clarify the return values.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for
          suggesting this.

        * ace/Service_Repository.{h,i}: Made the current_size() and
          total_size() methods const.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for
          suggesting this.

        * ace/Service_Repository.h: Fixed a typo in the comments.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Tue Jul 10 08:39:04 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:

          Added the macro ACE_LACKS_UNIX_SYSLOG.

Tue Jul 10 08:26:57 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp:

          Added a macro, ACE_LACKS_SETLOGMASK, for platforms that have
          syslog, but don't have setlogmask().

        * ace/config-chorus.h:

          ChorusOS 4.0.1 happens to be one of them.

Tue Jul 10 09:00:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.h
          Made the member 'd_name' of the 'dirent' struct non-const, because
          BCB had problems with it

Mon Jul 09 22:41:43 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU (exceptions):

          Include platform_macros.GNU before the default for "exceptions"
          is set.  This fixes a problem where the default native
          exceptions setting in platform_linux.GNU was not set due to the
          fact that it was previously set in wrapper_macros.GNU.  Thanks
          to Hans Utz <hans.utz@informatik.uni-ulm.de> for tracking down
          the problem.

Mon Jul  9 16:40:02 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp (ACE_Dirent_Selector):

          Correct order of initialization of members to match order of
          declaration.  Fixes a warning issued from GCC.

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.inl:

          Added missing RCS ID keyword.  Fuzz was whining about the lack
          of it.

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.h:

          Corrected some Doxygen comments.

Mon Jul 09 19:12:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Added Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog and Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log
          modules to the LOGGING component. Added Dirent_Selector to the
          UTILS component.

Mon Jul  9 15:59:56 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP since LynxOS doesn't seem to have
          this.

Mon Jul  9 15:28:29 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp:
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.h:

          Added ACE_INLINE guards around inclusion of Dirent_Selector.inl.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:

          Added Dirent_Selector.{h,i,cpp} to these projects.

Mon Jul  9 06:52:09 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.bor (OBJFILES): Added the Dirent_Selector.obj file.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp: Integrated a new test for the
          ACE_Dirent_Selector class.

        * ace/Makefile (UTILS_FILES),
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.h,
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.inl,
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp: Added support for a C++ wrapper facade that
          encapsulates ACE_OS_Dirent::scandir().  Thanks to Rich Newman for
          contributing this, as well.

        * ace/OS_Dirent.h,
        * ace/OS_Dirent.inl,
        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp: Added support for the scandir() feature, which
          makes it possible to selectively pick which files in a directory
          to iterate over.  Also fixed a bug in the emulation of dirent.
          Thanks to Rich Newman <RNewman@directv.com> for contributing
          these fixes.

Mon Jul 09 14:39:50 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (thr_getprio and thr_setprio): Changed these two
          function such that if we are on Solaris and we have pthreads
          enabled, we should use the pthread calls rather than the native
          Solaris calls.  The reasons for choosing the pthread calls is
          due to following problems with the native calls:

          - thr_getprio() is evil because on Solaris 5.8, a thread with
          priority -20 (SCHED_OTHER) is reported to have priority 80.

          - thr_setprio() is evil because it cannot set the negative
          priorities on Solaris 5.8.

          - Also, thr_setprio() cannot change the priority of a thread
          with negative priority to a positive priority on Solaris 5.8
          (even though there is no error reported and thr_getprio() shows
          that the change happened but pthread_getschedparam() shows that
          no change happened).

          - In addition, suppose a thread of policy SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO
          uses thr_setprio() to reset its priority, the priority will be
          reset but the scheduling policy will be dropped to SCHED_OTHER.
          This happens with both Solaris 5.7 and Solaris 5.8.

Mon Jul  9 13:33:43 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Change PACE path to start at $PACE_ROOT rather than $ACE_ROOT/PACE
          since the latter is not as flexible. Defined PACE_ROOT if not
          already defined. Also, added inclusion of PACE library for VxWorks
          even when inlining since not all the PACE functions should be
          inlined.

Mon Jul 09 10:59:22 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Mouna Seri <seri@crhc.uiuc.edu> to the hall of fame.

Mon Jul  9 11:10:44 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-5.h:
        * ace/config-win32-msvc-6.h:

          Added conditional definitions for ACE_LD_DECORATOR_STR
          "mfc" and "mfcd" so that the MFC release and debug versions
          of libraries can be dynamically loaded in the same way that
          the non-MFC release and debug versions are. Thanks to
          Francois Bernier <fbernier@gel.ulaval.ca> for suggesting
          this enhancement.

Mon Jul 09 11:31:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/pre.h
        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor

          Removed the disabling of the compiler warning 'parameter never
          used'. Unused parameters are handled by ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro.
          A missing ACE_UNUSED_ARG is now shown as warning in the BCB build
          log.

Sun Jul 08 11:26:23 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (mkstemp):
        * ace/OS.i (mkstemp):

          New mkstemp() wrapper.  It is assumed to be available on the
          given platform, unless ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP is defined.

        * ace/FILE_Connector.h:

          Added O_EXCL to the default flags.  This is a security hole
          fix.

        * ace/FILE_Connector.cpp (connect):

          If mkstemp() is available, then use it to create a temporary
          file rather than mktemp() (via ACE_FILE_Addr) since mktemp() is
          susceptible to a denial-of-service attack.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:

          mkstemp() is not supported on MS Windows and VxWorks.  Define
          ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP in these headers.

Sun Jul  8 08:13:12 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h: Added a comment explaining what
          the ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE macro means.  Thanks to
          Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobic@bvr.co.il> for motivating this.

Sat Jul  7 18:53:49 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:

          Revert the changes made to this file. Please see the file for a
          lengthy description.

Fri Jul 06 21:53:26 2001  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Reverted addition of ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION.

Fri Jul  6 19:55:23 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Reactor/Multicast: Adding the support for UNIX Syslog
          broke this example because LOG_DEBUG was suddenly defined as a
          macro (it's in syslog.h).  I've fixed this by renaming the LOG_
          enums to LM_ instead.  Thanks to Bala for reporting this.

Fri Jul 06 20:23:41 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Refcoutned_Auto_Ptr.i (null): Change const_cast<> to
          ACE_const_cast() to build on older compilers, like IBM C/C++ 3.6.6.

Fri Jul 06 20:13:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Name_Handler.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Server_Logging_Handler_T.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.cpp:

          More ACE_DEBUG disables.

Fri Jul  6 15:55:54 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_FD_SETSIZE):

          Integrated patch from Jody Hagins <jody@atdesk.com>.  Set the
          default reactor file descriptor set size to be an integer
          constant rather than a preprocessor constant.  Some third party
          software #undef FD_SETSIZE in their header files, causing build
          problems in ACE.

Fri Jul 06 18:20:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp: #if 0'd out a bunch of
          ACE_DEBUG statements that aren't appropriate for use in commercial
          logging. These can be #if 1'd if there's some doubt while debugging
          this stuff, but they aren't useful once debugged, and are
          distracting since they're interespersed with application records.

Fri Jul  6 13:40:20 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp: Fixed a warning in g++.

Fri Jul 06 11:39:41 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.h: Clarified (and improved doxygenation) of
          constructor and set() methods regarding byte orders.

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.icc: New file for this test.
        * tests/tests.icp: Added Max_Default_Port_Test

Fri Jul  6 08:36:20 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * netsvcs/Makefile: Don't build this if ACE_COMPONENTS does not
          contain Other.  The netsvcs library requires Naming_Context.

Fri Jul  6 05:44:13 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Makefile (LOGGING_FILES): Added support for
          Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.{h,cpp}:
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp,
        * ace/OS.h: Added support for a new UNIX syslog backend for the
          ACE_Log_Msg class.  Thanks to Jerry D. De Master
          <jdemaster@rite-solutions.com> and Robert Davidson
          <robert@rdavidson.freeserve.co.uk>.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.h: Fixed a typo in one of the send() method
          comments.  Thanks to Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Added a new file courtesy of John
          Zorko so that things will work on MacOSX.

Thu Jul  5 23:22:21 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

          Fixes that were required for fixing bug 575. Merged in from
          branch bug_575_stage_2.

Thu Jul  5 23:09:29 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (ACE_InputCDR): Fixed a long standing bug in
          the branch. This caused the DSI_Gateway test to fail. The
          problem was from setting the write pointer to a wrong position
          during the construction.

Thu Jul  5 14:39:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged with the main trunk and moved it to a new branch by name
          bug_575_stage_2.

Thu Jun 28 15:25:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.h (ACE_Reactor):
        * ace/Reactor.cpp: Added a new method resumable_handler () to the
          reactor interface. This would indicate whether the application
          can take advantage by resuming the handlers themselves or
          not. Not all reactors can allow this feature.

        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h:
        * ace/Reactor_Impl.cpp: Added a pure virtual function so that all
          the implementations can decide whether the handlers are
          resumable or not.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:Implemented resumable_handlers ().

Sun Jun 24 11:25:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Created this file. Got the whole stuff in ace to a new branch by
          name bug_575_stage_1. This ChangeLog file will be in branch
          bug_575.

Fri Jun 22 16:52:13 2001  Balachandran Natarajan <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp: Changed the copy constructor for the
          ACE_InputCDR's. Instead of duplicating the ACE_Data_Block we
          now use the new copy constructor in the ACE_Message_Block.

        * ace/Message_Block.h:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp: Added a new copy constructor to the
          ACE_Message_Block. This copy constructor does a deep copy from
          the data block if the data block of the incoming message block
          is on the stack or does a shallow copy of the data block (by
          incrementing the ref count) if it is on the heap.

        END of entries from bug_575_stage_2.

Thu Jul  5 22:07:33 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added the new perl script in LongUpcalls
          in the  daily builds.

Thu Jul  5 20:36:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h
            define ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION
        * tests/Token_Test.cpp
            Fix template instantiation problem.

Wed Jul  4 15:35:47 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_tests.vxworks:
          Removed invocation of CDR_Array_Test. According to the ace
          config files the compiler we are using is pre 2.8 (i.e.,
          ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 is defined). Therefore don't run
          CDR_Array_Test since the Makefile doesn't build it (due to
          the ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 macro).

Wed Jul 04 14:26:10 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.h (class ACE_Acquire_Method): Moved the enums from
          the Reverse Lock class into ACE_Acquire_Method, a non-template
          class.  These enums should have been inside the reverse lock
          class, but some lame compilers cannot handle enums inside
          template classes.

Wed Jul 04 12:43:22 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.i (ACE_Reverse_Lock): Fully specified the
          ACE_ACQUIRE_METHOD type.

Tue Jul  3 15:43:25 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Fixed a warning in g++.

Tue Jul  3 14:44:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigues@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Borland C++ apparently
          does not support the "extern template class" Microsoft VC++
          proprietary extension.  Thanks to Chris Kohloff <chris@kohlhoff.com>
          for the fix.

Tue Jul 03 12:26:33 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.h (class ACE_Reverse_Lock): Added a parameter to the
          constructor of the reverse lock.  The ACE_ACQUIRE_METHOD
          parameter is used to indicate which acquire() method will be
          called on the real lock when the release() method is called on
          the reverse lock. REGULAR indicated the acquire() method, READ
          indicates the acquire_read() method, and WRITE indicates the
          acquire_write() method.  Note that the try_*() methods are not
          represented here because we have to make sure that the release()
          method on the reverse lock acquires a lock on the real lock.

          Thanks to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for suggesting this.

Tue Jul  3 06:20:13 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.h,
        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h,
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp,
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.i,
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h,
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp,
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h: Added an enhancement that allows the
          Reactor to selectively purge event handlers from its
          notification queue according to their Reactor_Mask type.  Thanks
          to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for contributing this.

        * tests/Reactor_Notify_Test.cpp (run_notify_purge_test):
          Added a new set of tests for the new selective notification
          purging features of the Reactor.  Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edana@bandwiz.com> for contributing this.

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp: Removed the
          ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Result (handler, act, event, 0, 0, priority,
          signal_number), initializer since we no longer use virtual
          inheritance.  Thanks to Alexander Libman
          <alexander.libman@baltimore.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h: Removed the virtual inheritance from
          ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Result for the ACE_Asynch_Read_Stream_Result
          and ACE_Asynch_Read_Dgram_Result classes.  Thanks to Alexander
          Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h: Made the destructor of
          ACE_Refcounted_Auto_Ptr virtual so that users can override it
          locally.  Thanks to Jenny Kowald <jkowald@oz.agile.tv> for
          reporting this.

Tue Jul  3 09:40:59 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0_g++.GNU:

          Allow users to set options like debug, exceptions, ... without
          using override.

Tue Jul  3 08:38:47 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_dup_proactor.dsp:

          Fixed a mistake in the link to the ACE library.

Mon Jul  2 16:23:04 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_multiple_loops.dsp:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.dsp:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.dsw:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_timeout.dsp:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_udp_proactor.dsp:

          Fixed settings on release version of test_udp_proactor.dsp,
          added it to the workspace, and removed unused file folders
          from the FileViews of the other projects.

Mon Jul  2 15:26:32 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.6.h: Removed ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM and
          ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM.  Thanks to Glenn Popelka
          <gpp@gpopelka.com> for helping track this down.

Mon Jul 02 11:45:57 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/make_release:

          Disabled bootstrapping of ACE's autoconf support.  It isn't
          ready for general use.  Doing so reduces the amount of
          confusion.  Thanks to Holger P. Krekel <krekel@merlinux.de> for
          motivating this change.

Mon Jul  2 13:18:14 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * Moved ACE-configurations.txt into the docs directory.  Also
          removed the hopelessly out of date BIBLIOGRAPHY file.

        * Moved all the ChangeLog-* files into the new ChangeLogs
          directory.  Thanks to Holger P. Krekel <krekel@merlinux.de> for
          this suggestion.

Mon Jul 02 11:20:52 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * config.guess:
        * config.sub:

          Updated to the latest versions from the GNU FTP site.

Mon Jul 02 11:30:20 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.i: Since the release() method on the reverse lock
          calls the simple acquire() method on the real lock, it is
          assumed that it is a simple acquire/release protocol with the
          real lock.  Therefore, I think all the other methods on the
          reverse lock tryacquire(), acquire_read(), acquire_write(),
          tryacquire_read(), tryacquire_write(), and
          tryacquire_write_upgrade() should not be allowed.  This falls in
          line with the original concept of using reverse locks with
          regular guards.

          Thanks to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for pointing this out.

Mon Jul  2 11:17:37 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Profile_Timer.cpp:

          Cleaned up the conditional macros.  Added method bodies for
          ACE_Profile_Timer::get_rusage() and
          ACE_Profile_Timer::elapsed_rusage() when neither ACE_HAS_PRUSAGE_T
          nor ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE is defined.

        * Reverted the reverted changes in this entry.
          "Fri Jun 29 22:31:56 2001  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@cs.wustl.edu>".  These changes are ok, I just
          needed to fix the bug in Profile_Timer.cpp.

Mon Jul  2 09:40:45 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:

          Add the output filter to the linker to avoid the duplicate symbol
          warnings on AIX.

Mon Jul  2 05:40:54 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp: Enhanced the code so that it works with
          ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_TOTALLY.  Thanks to Nir Drang <nir@bandwiz.com>
          and Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/SPIPE_Addr.cpp (set): Added a "+ 1" to the computation of
          the size of the SPIPE_Addr to account for the trailing NUL.
          Thanks to Oren Zeev-Ben-Mordehai <oren@phonedo.com> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.{h,i}: Added support for a "null()"
          method to check if a refcounted auto ptr is NULL.  Thanks to
          Jenny Kowald <jkowald@oz.agile.tv> for reporting this.

        * ace/config-macosx.h,
        * ace/platform_macosx.GNU: Enhanced these files to support MacOSX.
          Thanks to John Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for contributing this.

        * ace/Synch.h: Fixed the Doxygen documentation for all the
          removed_ fields, which where somehow messed up.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Sun Jul  1 11:49:13 2001  Alexander Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com>

        * ace: Enhanced the POSIX and Sun Proactor implementations as
          follows:

          . POSIX_SIG_Proactor is now based on POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor

          . All classes ACE_POSIX_SIG_Asynch_XXXX are removed.
            POSIX_SIG_Proactor uses the ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Asynch_XXXX
            classes now.

          . ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::register_and_start_aio (...)
            now calls a new virtual method: int
            ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::allocate_aio_slot
            (ACE_POSIX_Asynch_Result *result).

          . The strategy of free slot allocation in SIG_Proactor is
            a bit different from AIOCB and SUN Proactors.  The
            allocate_aio_slot() method is responsible for setting
            notification information for aio request
            (SIGEV_NONE/SIGEV_SIGNAL).  For SIG_Proactor, the field
            aio_sigevent.sigev_value.sival_int now contains index of aiocb
            in the aiocb_list_, not a pointer.

          . The ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::find_completed_aio (int &error_status,
                                              int &return_status, size_t
                                              &index, size_t &count)
            parameter index defines initial slot to scan and the new
            parameter count tells us maximum number slots to scan.  On
            return: index contains value to start scan next time, count
            contains remained number of slots.  Scanning is performed in
            "wheel" style to allow all requests be handled with equal
            priorities.

          . ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::check_max_aio_num () checks for
            max_number_files to open and tries to setup max_number_files
            equal to aiocb_max_size_. if we failed than cut off
            aiocb_max_size_ value to existing max_number_files.

          . POSIX_Proactor added member int os_id_ and constructor sets up
            os_id_ (compilation time + run_time function) to know
            OS(Sun/HP/Linux/...) and version.  We need such info for
            POSIX_SIG_Proactors to take into account the behavior of
            different OS.

          . Delivery of simulated/"post_completed" Asynch_Results
            (Timers, AsynchAccept,Wakeup ...).  As both Proactors have no
            reliable mechanizm for delivery "post_completed" results, so
            the reliable queue of "post_completed" results was
            implemented.  The new member of AIOCB Proactor
            ACE_Unbounded_Queue<ACE_POSIX_Asynch_Result *> result_queue_
            has been added.  Also added protected methods to the
            ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor.

          . We had an error in all previous versions (from major ACE 5.1):
            post_completion (int how_many) does not guarantee that all
            completions will be delivered to the different threads running
            event_loop (sometimes several completions could be delivered
            to the one thread, in another thread performs during long time
            application_spesific_code ()).  Moreover, you can run now
            Proactor event_loop in any number of threads (more than
            SIGQUEMAX).

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor: Integrated a test that exercises the
          support for asynchronous UDP operations.  Thanks to Roger Tragin
          <r.tragin@computer.org> for contributing this.

        * ace/Synch_T.i: Changed the implementations of all the
          acquire*() method to call release().  Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edana@bandwiz.com> for reporting this.
