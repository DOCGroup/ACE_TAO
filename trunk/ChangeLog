	* ace/OS.h:

	  AIX defines "off64_t" as its 64 bit offset type.  Typedef
	  ACE_LOFF_T as that type if ACE_HAS_LLSEEK or ACE_HAS_LSEEK64 is
	  defined.  This should correct a problem that occurred during an
	  AIX configure script run.  Thanks to Mike Winter for pointing
	  this out.

	* configure.in:

	  Fixed test that checks if sched.h is needed for thread
	  scheduling definitions.  This should correct problems discovered
	  on RedHat 6.1 installations.  Thanks to 

	  Improved sys_nerr and sys_errlist[] tests by checking for
	  external global variables in libraries.  This should correct a
	  problem discovered in an AIX configure script run.  Thanks to
	  Mike Winter for providing feedback.

	* ace/Service_Config: Updated the documentation for the various
	  open() methods and the constructors.  Thanks to Christopher
 	  Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for reporting this.

	* Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

	  man/man3/Makefile.am and man/html/Makefile.am previously weren't
	  being labelled.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

	* examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests: Updated the
	  README file so it'll point to the right documentation!  Thanks
 	  to John Buttitto for reporting this.

        * ACE version 5.0.11 released.

Mon Jan 03 07:34:38 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): return res instead of *res, because
          the function returns a struct tm *, not a struct tm.

Sun Jan  2 11:02:54 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): We should return *res rather than
          *result to make the behavior correct for Win32.  Thanks to
          J. Afshar <jafshar@vignette.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 02 00:50:00 2000  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.{cpp, h, i}
          ace/Signal.cpp
          ace/Synch.cpp
          ace/config-psos-diab-ppc.h: Added support for native mutexs,
          condition variables, and thread-specific storage in pSOS.  Native
          pSOS mutexes, where available, support several cool features,
          including lock recursion and priority inheritance protocol and
          priority ceiling protocol support.
