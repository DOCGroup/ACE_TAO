Wed Sep 29 07:06:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Fixed pre/post check, the matching of the /**/ was not
          correct. Added a check for _MSC_VER >= 1200. This is at
          level 6, when we have updated more code, we can lower the
          level.

Tue Sep 28 21:05:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* Makefile.am:

	  Changed to add TAO to subdirs if BUILD_TAO is defined.

	  be installed.

Tue Sep 28 15:22:01 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

	  Changed to add $(ACE_BUILDDIR) to include path for automake
	  builds.

Tue Sep 28 12:48:37 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          My change from Mon Sep 27 14:10:15 2004 was causing problems with
          cygwin builds.  A better solution is to not set INSBIN at all and
          allow it to be set in the generated makefile or by the user on the
          make command line.

Tue Sep 28 15:25:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_fcntl.h:
          For the DMC compiler define _O_TEMPORARY, seems to lack this

Tue Sep 28 14:38:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-dmc.h:
          When ACE_LACKS_STRUCT_DIR is defined, undef it, it must not be
          set with the DMC compiler

Tue Sep 28 14:14:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_win32_dmc.GNU:
          Added -ND to the CFLAGS to indicate that we want to build with
          thread and dll support.

Tue Sep 28 09:13:57 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Borland Make has a maximum line length of roughly 32767.  The
          'all' target could exceed that length given a large amount of
          projects within a single workspace.  In that case, we have to
          create an 'all' target that specifically lists the target commands
          and thereby creating a larger workspace makefile, but working
          around the Borland Make limitation.

Tue Sep 28 11:28:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          Removed setting of ACE_SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE, this is done in
          Basic_Types.h

Mon Sep 27 18:53:33 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/script.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/man.mpb:

          New files to support scripts and manpages.  Inherit from these
          files, add the list of scripts or manapages to Script_Files or
          Man_Files, and MPC templates with script/manpage support will
          do the right thing.

Mon Sep 27 21:16:24 2004  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Do not complain about @file directives without a filename.
          Doxygen assumes the current file as the filename, so it cannot
          possibly be inconsistent.

Mon Sep 27 17:44:08 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:

          Changed to add $(TAO_BUILDDIR)/orbsvcs to include path for
          automake builds.

          MPC-generated automake files, tweaked to work correctly. The rest of
          the automake files will be checked in in the coming days. This set
          replaces older ones that pre-dated the MPC-usage effort and were
          largely out of date as they were.

Mon Sep 27 14:10:15 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Set INSBIN to $(PWD) by default.  To allow installation of apps
          (even if 'install' is not used in the mpc file), the gnu template
          always sets INSTALL to $(VBIN:%=$(INSBIN)/%) for exe's.  Without
          this change every exe built gets installed up in $(ACE_ROOT)/bin
          which is not what we want.

Mon Sep 27 13:46:21 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Modified the template to override the value of INSBIN if it is set
          to '.'.  This is similar to what is done for INSLIB and is an
          iteration with rules.local.GNU.  When installing, it checks for
          $PWD but does not account for the fact that '.' is the same as
          $PWD.

Mon Sep 27 15:34:35 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb:

          Added CIAO_DnC_Client to the list of libraries being linked in.

Mon Sep 27 09:25:37 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/RT_CORBA_Leader_Follower.cpp:

          Put back the recently-removed ACE_UINT64_DBLCAST_ADAPTER,
          so now it and static_cast<double> are both applied to the
          computation of elapsed_time_per_invocation, which will hopefully
          satisfy both MSVC 6 and MSVC 7.1.

Mon Sep 27 12:54:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/xerces.mpb:
          New base project which can be used when xerces is used

Sun Sep 26 18:58:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          Removed setting of MAXSYMLINKS when not set, this is not the way
          to fix compile problems in OS_NS_stdlib.cpp, set ACE_LACKS_SYMLINKS
          instead if symbolic links are not supported

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_SYMLINKS, removed MAXSYMLINKS

        * ace/config-vxworks.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_SYMLINKS, ACE_LACKS_REALPATH and
          ACE_HAS_NONCONST_READV

Sun Sep 26 21:06:53 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.h:
          (mktemp, mkstemp) Changed protototype (parameter name) to match
          implementation.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp: (realpath)
          Added check for new macro ACE_LACKS_SYMLINKS to leave out symbolic
          links related code. This fixes compile errors on platforms which
          do not support symbolic links. Fixes bug 1900.

        * ace/README:
          Added ACE_LACKS_SYMLINKS.

Sun Sep 26 14:13:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ICMP_Socket.cpp:

          Fixed incorrect ACE_TRACE usage

Sun Sep 26 14:10:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/imr_activator.mpb:

        * ace/ICMP_Socket.h:
        * ace/Ping_Socket.h:
          Added missing /**/ before include of pre/post.h to fix fuzz
          errors

Sun Sep 26 10:07:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE_crc32.cpp:
        * ace/ACE_crc_ccitt.cpp:
          Removed trailing ; after namespace closure, fixes Tru64 build
          warning

Fri Sep 24 22:35:25 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        From Robert S. Iakobashvili <roberti at go-WLAN dot com> and

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Added new ICMP and "ping" source files to the appropriate
          source lists.

Fri Sep 24 13:16:44 MST 2004  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Added new ImplRepo tests.

Fri Sep 24 11:07:03 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE_crc32.cpp:
        * ace/ACE_crc_ccitt.cpp:

          Changed the buffer and iovec versions of ACE::crc32() and
          ACE_crc_ccitt() family of functions to take an additional
          initial/partial crc argument.  This allows CRCs to be computed
          over multiple buffers/iovecs by passing the result as input to
          the next call.  The default value allows callers to omit the
          argument on the first call.

Fri Sep 24 12:39:31 2004  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * build/Linux/include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Provide reasonable defaults for Boost.Test

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/boost_unit_test.mpb:
          Different sites may have different configurations for boost,
          made the options needed to compile with it configurable via the
          platform_macros.GNU file.

Fri Sep 24 10:21:38 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrrency/Leader_Follower/RT_CORBA_Leader_Follower.cpp:

          Replaced ACE_UINT64_DBLCAST_ADAPTER, which doesn't satisfy
          the stricter MSVC 7.1, with static_cast<double>.

Fri Sep 24 10:55:34 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: If __USE_POSIX199309 is defined from
          <features.h> set ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME. This is most often the case.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acelib.mpb: For automake projects,
          change ACE_ROOT to either top_srcdir or top_builddir depending
          on whether it's looking for source (such as includes) or libraries.

        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Synch_Lib/Synch_Benchmarks_Synch_Lib.mpc:
          Changed base project from aceexe to acelib. This builds a library.

Fri Sep 24 07:04:29 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Add new files.

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE_crc_ccitt.cpp:

          Added ACE::crc_ccitt() family of functions in new file
          ACE_crc_ccitt.cpp.

        * ace/ACE_crc32.cpp:

          Changed table and shift expression so the special case with
          additional masking for systems where ACE_UINT32 is more than 32
          bits wide (such as the Cray) is not needed.  See "A Painless
          Guide to CRC Error Detection Algorithms" by Ross Williams for
          details.

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/ACE_crc32.cpp:

          Split out ACE::crc32() family of functions out of ACE.cpp into
          new file ACE_crc32.cpp.

Fri Sep 24 08:36:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lite.h:
          The ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro didn't work with the DMC compiler, so
          added a new version of this macro that silences the not used
          warning with DMC.

Fri Sep 24 08:29:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (sendto):
          Removed usage of ACE_CONST_CAST

Thu Sep 23 19:27:22 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/ACE.h:

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:
          Added some checks for __DMC__ for the Digital Mars compiler

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp:
          Added some checks for __DMC__ for the Digital Mars compiler and
          use ::_close instead of _close, the former works with all compilers
          and DMC, with DMC the _close is a macro.

Thu Sep 23 19:53:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/streams.h:
          Removed explicit check of _MSC_VER >= 1200, just check for _MSC_VER,
          version 1200 is msvc6, the oldest msvc compiler we support, this
          compiler and newer have pragma warning push/pop

Thu Sep 23 12:07:02 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/ACE.h:

          Changed buffer version of ACE::crc32 to take a void * argument
          (to avoid requiring callers to cast non-char data structures),
          and a size_t length.

          Added an 'exename' setting for the projects in these mpc files.
          The cpp files contain some form of ACE_MAIN which used to be
          recognized by MPC as an entry point.  It is now necessary to set
          exename since MPC will no longer recognize ACE_MAIN as a "main"
          function.

Thu Sep 23 15:13:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Doxygen improvement

Thu Sep 23 07:42:33 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Changed buffer and iovec versions of ACE:crc32() to hoist
          computing the end position out of the loop.

Thu Sep 23 14:34:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-dmc.h:
          New config file for the Digital Mars C++ compiler (see
          www.digitalmars.com). Not fully working, but a first version.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_win32_dmc.GNU:
          New GNU file for the DMC compiler, also first version

        * ace/config-win32.h:
          Added check for __DMC__

          More small changes for the DMC compiler will follow

Wed Sep 22 14:40:15 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Changed ACE::crc32() family of functions to NOT fold in the
          length of the string/buffer/iovec into the CRC.

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/ACE.h:

          Changed return type of ACE::crc32() family of functions from
          u_long to ACE_UINT32.

Wed Sep 22 13:46:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_cidlc.pl:

          CIDLC cannot be compiled in release mode. Enable only debug
          mode.

Wed Sep 22 10:35:18 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added const qualifier to ACE_OS::crc_table_.

Wed Sep 22 17:37:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.h:
          Doxygen fix

Wed Sep 22 07:04:46 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug that I introduced in my Tue Sep 21 06:38:17 2004
          change.  INSBIN can't be set to '.'.  It causes many problematic
          interations with rules.local.GNU and rules.nested.GNU.

Tue Sep 21 20:13:40 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added checks for getipnodebyaddr() and getipnodebyname() which
          set ACE_LACKS_GETIPNODEBYADDR and ACE_LACKS_GETIPNODEBYNAME.

        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.inl:

          Changed __GLIBC__'s in conditionals to ACE_LACKS_GETIPNODEBYADDR
          or ACE_LACKS_GETIPNODEBYNAME.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Added #define for ACE_LACKS_GETIPNODEBYADDR and
          ACE_LACKS_GETIPNODEBYNAME.

Tue Sep 21 17:50:27 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Naming/naming.mpc: Correct the exename for Nodelocal.
          It was conflicting with that of Netlocal, which, when generated,
          confused Visual Age C++ templates and automake.

Tue Sep 21 12:16:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp: parse_encoding_decl(), don't
          crash if the input source doesn't declare an encoding.
          reset(), if current_ is already 0 (the case if no parsing ever
          really got started) don't dereference it.

Tue Sep 21 18:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (readlink):
          Only when ACE_LACKS_READLINK this is not supported, the checks for
          win32 or wince are removed.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Define ACE_LACKS_READLINK

Tue Sep 21 15:29:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/QtReactor_Test.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect ACE_TRACE usage, thanks to Vincent Newsum
          <Newsum at fel dot tno dot nl> for reporting this, this fixes
          BUG 1940.

Tue Sep 21 06:38:17 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          This is a fix for [Bug 1915].  I moved the block of code that
          set up INSBIN and INSLIB before the include of wrapper_macros.GNU
          to ensure that the values for 'install', 'dllout' and 'libout' are
          used instead of the defaults found in wrapper_macros.GNU.  I
          didn't use the patch supplied for this bug because it didn't take
          into accout the possibility of overriding the INSBIN and INSLIB
          values on the make command line.  Thanks to Thomas Girard
          <thomas.g.girard@free.fr> for reporting this and supplying a
          patch.

Tue Sep 21 09:56:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/QtReactor.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect ACE_TRACE usage, thanks to Vincent Newsum
          <Newsum at fel dot tno dot nl> for reporting this, this fixes
          BUG 1939. We should setup a daily build with Qt soon.

Mon Sep 20 18:07:03 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/run_test.pl:

          Reverted the change "Sun Sep 19 20:36:43 2004  Balachandran
          Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" since it was giving
          troubles on every platform.

Mon Sep 20 06:54:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          Set ssl to 0 again, added wince=0, seems this has been removed by
          accident

Sun Sep 19 20:36:43 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/run_test.pl:

          Fix for BUG 1924. Please see

          http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1924

          for details. Thanks to Paul <paul at reeder dot cs> for the
          patch.

Sun Sep 19 14:51:32 2004  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Add yet another test to the list.

Sun Sep 19 13:49:31 2004  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          Add new "boost" feature.  It should be enabled if you
          are planning to use the boost::unit_test_framework classes.
          Naturally you will also have to install boost (www.boost.org)
          I am writing unit tests for some classes, and I am too stubborn
          to use a sub-standard unit tests frameworks like cxxtest, but
          too smart to roll my own.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/boost_unit_test.mpb:
          New base project for unit tests based on the
          boost::unit_test_framework.  Try it, it is good for you.

Sun Sep 19 08:03:57 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_cidlc.pl:

          A new perl script to compile and build the CIDL compiler.

Fri Sep 17 13:19:05 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Message_Queue_Test_Ex.cpp:

          Corrected minor build problems for VxWorks.

Fri Sep 17 11:53:10 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Return the system variable, maxFiles, in ACE::max_handles()
          instead of the FD_SETSIZE which does not reflect the actual limit.

        * ace/Capabilities.cpp:

          Template instantiations for the ACE_Hash<ACE_TString> and
          ACE_Equal_To<ACE_TString> were conflicting with template
          specialization of the same on VxWorks.  I'm not sure if they are
          required for any compiler, but I wanted to be safe and exclude
          them in a #if !defined (VXWORKS).

        * ace/Proactor.cpp:

          Moved the template instantiations for
          auto_ptr<ACE_Asynch_Result_Impl> and
          auto_ptr<ACE_Asynch_Result_Impl> into the right #if clause.

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:

          The current GNU compiler for VxWorks (2.96) is the only old
          compiler that could possible build ACE and it supports template
          specialization, lacks auto_ptr and has various other platform
          differences.

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:

          Define MAXSYMLINKS if it isn't defined by the system headers.
          I chose 20 which is what I found in other system header files.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h:

          Define S_ISLNK if it isn't defined by the system headers.

          Char width fixes to build clean with wide-char.

Fri Sep 17 08:42:50 2004  Steve Totten  <totten_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm (Executable):
          Fixed an error in which Executable() returns a UNIX-style
          path instead of a Windows-style path if the IGNOREEXESUBDIR
          member is set.  Now, test scripts can use
          PerlACE::Process::IgnoreExeSubDir() to make sure an
          executable is found in the path specified without the
          addition of the setting of -ExeSubDir.  This change was
          required for Windows Release and Static builds after the
          installation directory for various common utilities was
          changed to %ACE_ROOT%\bin.

Fri Sep 17 09:30:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added several defines, result of autoconf testing with Cygwin

Thu Sep 16 20:40:06 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Removed SecurityLevel1 test from this list of tests to run.  The
          SecurityLevel1 IDL module is longer supported by TAO.

Fri Sep 17 00:25:17 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/IOStream_T.h:
        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
          Changed NULL to 0 to silence compile time warning.

Thu Sep 16 14:14:31 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event_serv.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from svc_utils.

Thu Sep 16 12:36:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.{h cpp}: Change the SystemType enumerator value
          names to begin with ACE_. This avoids conflicts with other facilities
          that use an OS_ prefix.

Thu Sep 16 09:22:08 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
          In ACE_TSS_Cleanup::exit, defer deleting TSS objects
          until it is no longer necessary to access the ACE_TSS_Cleanup
          itself.  One of the objects to be deleted is a Thread_Exit
          which may eventually cause (or at least allow) the deletion
          of the ACE_TSS_Cleanup.
          The original code worked like this but I changed it when
          I added additional cleanup operations to the exit method.

Thu Sep 16 08:14:14 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp:
        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:

          Removed a bug workaround for aCC A.03.04.  It is no longer a
          problem to specify other mmap base addresses when running
          64-bit HP-UX applications.

Thu Sep 16 07:47:09 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a CUSTOM_TARGETS macro that will allow users to access
          custom targets that can be generated with the use of the
          'verbatim' clause in mpc files.

:09 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a CUSTOM_TARGETS macro that will allow users to access
          custom targets that can be generated with the use of the
          'verbatim' clause in mpc files.

Thu Sep 16 10:07:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * apps/Gateway/Peer/peer.mpc:
        * apps/Gateway/Peer/svc.conf:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/gateway.mpc:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/svc.conf:

          Changed MPC configuration to generate the correct makefiles/project
          files for building a separate daemon executable and service object
          shared library.
          Changed service configurator files to use correct PATH specification.

Thu Sep 16 08:28:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
          Added special include for VxWorks, it defines _POSIX_TIMER_MAX
          in time.h

Thu Sep 16 08:20:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM and ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_mman.{h,inl}:
          Moved include ace/os_include/sys/os_mman.h from inl to header
          file, so that we get all the needed constants when building
          with Cygwin and inlining disabled

Thu Sep 16 07:55:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Removed ACE_HAS_CYGWIN32_SOCKET_H

Thu Sep 16 07:33:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added the new orbsvcs libs

Wed Sep 15 15:32:59 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added checks for fgetws and fputws.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:

          Added feature test macros ACE_LACKS_FGETWS and ACE_LACKS_FPUTWS
          and disable wide character versions of fgets and fputs if they
          are not present.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this
          bug.

Wed Sep 15 15:17:39 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.h:

          Changed preprocessor conditional for the declaration of the wide
          character version of strtok_r_emulation() to use ACE_WCHAR and
          ACE_LACKS_WCSTOK instead of ACE_HAS_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this bug.

Wed Sep 15 11:41:53 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (set_handle_limit): Removed the

          ACE_NOTREACHED (return 0);

          and replaced it with

          return 0;

          Thanks to Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl> for reporting this.

Wed Sep 15 10:46:07 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Explicitly initialize a static int to zero to make it clear that
          the initial value is important.

Wed Sep 15 12:51:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configure.ac:
          Removed check for ACE_HAS_CYGWIN32_SOCKET_H, this is not needed
          anymore

Tue Sep 14 22:44:39 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Inet_Addr.cpp:

          Fix for the problem reported by Charlie Duke, which is that
          ACE_INET_Addr::string_to_addr cannot accept an address string
          produced by ACE_INET_Addr::addr_to_string method. The output of
          addr_to_string method is of the form "[ipv4]:port" while the
          string_to_addr accepts "ipv4:port" i.e. cannot handle "[]".

          The fix for this is not to include "[]" in
          string_to_addr. Thanks to Charlie Duke <cduke at fvc dot com>.

        * THANKS: Updated Charlie's email address.

Tue Sep 14 15:02:05 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * NEWS:
          Updated: TSS leak has been conquered.

Tue Sep 14 11:07:25 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Malloc_T.{h inl}: Added ACE_Cached_Allocator<>::pool_depth()
          and ACE_Dynamic_Cached_Allocator<>::pool_depth(). Each returns the
          number of items in the cache available for allocating. Thank you to
          Jeff Jones <jjones@zonetrading.com> for this addition.

        * tests/Cached_Allocator_Test.cpp: Added tests of the new pool_depth()
          method.

        * THANKS: Added Jeff Jones to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Sep 14 11:58:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.h:
          Doxygen improvement

Tue Sep 14 10:21:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          Added support for the Intel 8.1 C++ Compiler

Tue Sep 14 07:01:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNaming_Skel to the list of projects
          to build first.

Mon Sep 13 19:09:23 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:

          Changed to use ACE_CHECK_HAS_FUNC([scandir]) and get rid of
          explicit definition, autoconf template macro, etc.

Mon Sep 13 20:33:25 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Changed the
          ACE_Select_Reactor_Handler_Repository::open() method so that it
          uses the generalized ACE::set_handle_limit() method to not lower
          the handles, which caused problems for applications that want to
          use small reactor sizes but not limit the number of handles in
          the process.  Thanks to Eider Oliveira <eider at oliveira dot
          gmail at com> for suggesting this.

        * ace/ACE.cpp,
          ace/ACE.h: Generalized ACE::set_handle_limit() so
          it can be told not to lower the handle limit.

Mon Sep 13 18:15:44 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ACE_wrappers/m4/platform.m4:

          Added new ACE_FUNC_IOCTL_ARGTYPES macro, used to set
          ACE_IOCTL_TYPE_ARG2.

        * ACE_wrappers/ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Added ACE_IOCTL_TYPE_ARG2 definition.

        * ACE_wrappers/ace/OS_NS_stropts.h:
        * ACE_wrappers/ace/OS_NS_stropts.inl:

          Added feature test macro ACE_IOCTL_TYPE_ARG2 (which defaults to
          int) so that ACE_OS::ioctl uses the same type as ::ioctl.  This
          help avoid sign extension problems on 64 bit platforms that use
          unsigned long.

Mon Sep 13 15:52:04 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Bugzilla Bug 1542 TSS Leak revisited.
          The goal is for each thread's TSS object to be
          deleted at thread exit time, and for the TSS
          key itself to be released when:
            the last thread stops using it, or
            the ACE_TSS<X> (if any) is deleted
          which ever comes *last*.

Mon Sep 13 14:56:53 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.h (class ACE_RB_Tree):
        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp:

          Added a special constructor useful for providing a valid vtable
          and allocator if the tree is reconstructed from shared
          memory. Thanks to Lothar Werzinger for the patches.

Mon Sep 13 12:49:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Alter the value of ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR based
          on whether or not __64BIT__ is set (4 if yes, 2 if no). See
          /usr/include/sys/types.h for verification.

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Connection_Handler.cpp: Add missing #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h".

Mon Sep 13 12:39:11 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp: Added explicit template instantiations for
          Wed Sep  8 17:13:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Mon Sep 13 06:50:46 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dslogadmin_serv.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from svc_utils.

Mon Sep 13 12:02:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNotification_Skel

Mon Sep 13 10:42:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          When using the 8.0 compiler, disable certain warnings about padding

Mon Sep 13 09:57:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          The intel compiler on Itanium is called icc, not ecc anymore

Mon Sep 13 09:46:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Fixed compile error in VxWorks specific code

Mon Sep 13 09:44:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-icc-common.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION

Mon Sep 13 09:31:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configure.ac:
          Added ACE_CHECK_LACKS_HEADERS for wchar.h.

Mon Sep 13 09:06:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNaming_Serv to the list of projects
          to build first.

Sun Sep 12 17:20:39 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventlogadmin.mpb

          Update *.mpb files to reflect new libraries.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dseventlogadmin.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dseventlogadmin_serv.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dseventlogadmin_skel.mpb

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dslogadmin_skel.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dsnotifylogadmin.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dsnotifylogadmin_serv.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/dsnotifylogadmin_skel.mpb

          Split Logging, Event Logging, and Notify Logging Services into
          client stub, servant skeleton, and service implementation
          libraries.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ec_use_typed_events_serv.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event_serv.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event_skel.mpb

          Updated dependencies.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ec_use_typed_events_skel.mpb:

          Removed file, events skeleton w/typed events does not require
          any additional dependencies.  They have been moved to _serv.

Sun Sep 12 17:20:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log):
          In then handling of %Z replaced an ACE_NEW_RETURN with a
          ACE_NEW_NORETURN, so that when allocation fails, we just do
          a break instead of return. Seems this code was written before
          the existence of ACE_NEW_NORETURN. This also fixes the crashing
          of the Intel 8.0 C++ Compiler on Itanium on this file, no idea
          why this caused a crash, that is one for Intel to sort out.

Sat Sep 11 11:41:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.cpp:
        * apps/Gateway/Peer/peerd.cpp:
          Added missing includes to fix compile problems in Cygwin build

Fri Sep 10 22:54:55 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_server.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_server_dnc.mpb:

          Added utils to the list of projects that are inherited.

Sat Sep 11 00:49:39 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/IOStream.h:
          Changed NULL to 0 to silence compile time warning.

Fri Sep 10 15:39:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.{h inl cpp}: Added a new static method that
          calculates the difference between two ACE_hrtime_t quantities.
          Takes into account that the time counter may have wrapped around
          between the start and end. Changed all time difference calculations
          to use the new elapsed_hrtime() method.

Fri Sep 10 13:53:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Time_Value.h:
        * ace/Time_Value.inl:

      Moved '#include "ace/Basic_Types.h"' from Time_Value.cpp to
      Time_Value.h because it's needed there since ACE_UINT64 is
      introduced (see below).

Thu Sep 09 18:29:17 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Time_Value.h (msec):
        * ace/Time_Value.inl (msec):

          Even though MSVC++ 6 supports 64 bit integers, it does not
          support the "long long" syntax.  Instead it supports its own
          "__int64" built-in type.  Use "ACE_UINT64" instead of "unsigned
          long long".  Fixes syntax errors exhibited by MSVC++ 6.

Thu Sep  9 16:40:27 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Connection_Handler.cpp:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Connection_Handler_Connector.cpp:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/File_Parser.{h cpp}:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Gateway.cpp:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/gatewayd.cpp:
        * apps/Gateway/Peer/Options.{h cpp}:
        * apps/Gateway/Peer/Peer.{h cpp}: Narrow/wide char fixes.

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Options.h: Removed const char *connector_host()
          method because it's not ever defined or referenced.

        * apps/Gateway/Peer/peer.mpc: New project definition.

Thu Sep  9 16:17:38 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Templates.cpp:
          Added explicit static template member instantiations.

Thu Sep  9 05:58:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Implemented num_processors and num_processors_online for Cygwin

Wed Sep  8 21:50:13 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Time_Value.h:
        * ace/Time_Value.inl:

          The change added in this checkin

          Wed Sep  8 10:17:46 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>
          should not be available on platforms that lacks long long.

Wed Sep  8 17:13:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.{h cpp}: Added new private method,
          ACE_DLL_Handle::get_dll_names().
          This builds the list of names to try to dlopen() based on the
          specified dll_name and the platform's prefix/suffix/decorator
          configuration. It doesn't try to load anything and doesn't do any
          search path games like ACE::ldfind(). All of the rules for locating
          files based on environments and security policy are administered by
          the OS. This just feeds names to try, allowing for example, svc.conf
          to continue simply specifying base names like "ACE". This restores
          basic OS functionality, such as the ability to load a DLL from the
          same directory as the loading executable, as well as closing
          potential security loopholes opened by ACE's scanning the search
          path and passing absolute paths to dlopen().
          ACE_DLL_Handle::open() now calls get_dll_names() for a list of names
          to try unless ACE_MUST_HELP_DLOPEN_SEARCH_PATH is defined, in which
          case it does the old ACE::ldfind() call and dlopen()s the
          absolute path as it did before this change.

          This also allows DLLs to load on wide-char non-Windows builds without
          messing with the sprintf() format specs in Lib_Find.cpp.

Wed Sep  8 10:17:46 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Time_Value.{h,inl} Added a new msec() method that uses
          unsigned long long to compute the value to prevent overflow.
          Thanks to Boris Kaminer <boris_kaminer@mail.ru> for reporting this.

Wed Sep  8 08:15:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        * tests/FIFO_Test.cpp
          Fixed one of the failing tests under HPUX requires delay like AIX

Wed Sep  8 08:15:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        * tests/IOStream_Test.cpp
          Sorry, I got the wrong header file yesterday; isspace() is defined in
          ace/os_include/os_ctype.h  NOT  #include ace/OS_NS_ctype.h

Tue Sep  7 16:39:28 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtnotify.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/time.mpb

          Update *.mpb files to reflect new libraries.  In many cases this
          required adding inheriting from additional base projects, as
          libraries were being linked in because of naming -- which was
          once the service implementation (and thus pulled in lots of
          other libraries) and is now just the Naming client stubs.

          Split Event, Naming, Notification, and Trading Services into
          client stub, servant skeleton, and service implementation
          libraries.

Tue Sep  7 15:45:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        * examples/IOStream/server/iostream_server.cpp
          getpid() from ace/OS_NS_unistd.h actually used in both halves of
          #ifdef #else #endif guard so the conditional arround the #include
          is actually wrong and so has been removed.

        * tests/IOStream_Test.cpp
          isspace() used without #include ace/OS_NS_ctype.h, added this to
          the guarded section where it is used.

Tue Sep  7 07:08:26 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:

          As part of the -expand_env option, I moved some functionality out
          of the ProjectCreator.pm and into this module which was only used
          by this project creator.

Tue Sep  7 06:41:27 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Removed the if check for static_libs_only.  The STATIC_LINK_FLAG
          option will be added to the LDFLAGS if static_link is set to 1.

Mon Sep  6 10:04:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          When using VxWorks also include OS_NS_stdio.h

Mon Sep  6 07:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Removed include of sys/modem.h for HPUX, this is already done in
          os_include/os_termios.h

Fri Sep  3 15:53:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h: Added ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE. This may be
          pertinent to previous Solaris versions, but I don't have any
          to test on.

Fri Sep  3 12:34:41 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_mman.inl:

          Removed redundant conditional used to disable madvise for WIN32
          systems.  Instead use ACE_LACKS_MADVISE feature test macro.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:

          Added ACE_LACKS_MADVISE definition.

Fri Sep  3 15:10:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-5.x.h: Add ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h: Include "ace/OS_NS_errno.h" - ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN
          sets errno.

Fri Sep  3 21:36:51 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * apps/drwho/File_Manager.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_STATIC_TEMPLATE_MEMBER_INSTANTIATION
          to check if explicit template instantiation is needed.
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for informing me about this
          macro.

Fri Sep  3 20:02:20 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
          There is no need to check missing prototype since this has
          already been taken care by os_unistd.h.

        * ace/os_include/arpa/os_inet.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stdlib.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_strings.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h:
          To make things easier to maintain use new ACE_LACKS_xxx_PROTOTYPE
          macros to check whether we need to declare missing function
          prototype.

        * ace/README:
          Added new ACE_LACKS_xxx_PROTOTYPE macros

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Modified to follow changes above.

Fri Sep  3 19:35:48 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:
          Removed broken macro redefinition code to prevent people
          thinking that it actually works. Cleaned up #undef's.

Fri Sep  3 19:30:18 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
          LynxOS no longer needs special macro handling.

Fri Sep  3 19:13:24 2004  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * apps/drwho/File_Manager.cpp:
          LynxOS 3.x needs explicit template instantiation.

Fri Sep  3 10:44:27 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (append_proc): If the process_table_ needs
          to be enlarged, make sure it's to a size greater than 0. If the
          original size is 0, change it to DEFAULT_SIZE, else double it (as
          was always done).
          (resize): Changed to not shrink the process_table_ array. Primarily
          to guard against changing it to 0, but also guards against having to
          decide what to do with entries that won't fit in the new array.

Fri Sep  3 07:43:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/DLL/test_dll.cpp:
        * examples/Export/test.cpp:
          Fixed for unicode builds

Thu Sep  2 16:39:29 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Changed to define ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:

          Changed ace_timezone() to use ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE feature test
          macro instead of OS-specific macros to determine whether to
          use global timezone variable or the gettimeofday() function
          to obtain the current timezone.

        * configure.ac:

          Changed to call ACE_VAR_TIMEZONE.

        * m4/platform.m4:

          Added new macro, ACE_VAR_TIMEZONE.  Sets new feature test macro
          ACE_HAS_TIMEZONE if platform supports global timezone variable.

Thu Sep  2 16:43:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/ace.m4: Added AM_CONDITIONAL for BUILD_EXCEPTIONS, BUILD_THREADS,
          BUILD_ACE_CODECS, BUILD_ACE_FILECACHE, BUILD_ACE_OTHER,
          BUILD_ACE_TOKEN, BUILD_ACE_UUID, BUILD_RWHO, BUILD_WFMO, and
          BUILD_WINREGISTRY so the MPC 'requires' feature can properly weed
          things out without configure- and build-time errors.

Thu Sep  2 12:51:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp:

          Changed commandline buildup of childprocesses to start with './'
          for non-WIN32 platforms as with other tests.
          By default test did not run on OpenVMS without this.

Thu Sep  2 12:51:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-openvms.h:

          Added ACE_LACKS_UNIX_SIGNALS since OpenVMS cannot use signals
          in combination with PTHREAD.

        * ace/Process.cpp:
        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp:

          Implemented alternatives in timed wait() functions for systems
          with ACE_LACKS_UNIX_SIGNALS and !WIN32.

Thu Sep  2 07:24:20 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:

          Switch the borland template over to use the INSTALL_THIS_TARGET
          template value instead of a 'verbatim' section to do the same
          thing.

Thu Sep  2 09:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          With gcc 3.4.1 -mcpu is deprecated, but -mtune must be used

Thu Sep  2 07:24:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/FaCE/FaCE.mpc:
        * apps/FaCE/FaCENOACE.mpc:
          Added missing Id tag

Wed Sep  1 17:16:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Reverse_Lock_T.inl:
        * ace/Typed_SV_Message.inl: Added #include "ace/config-all.h" to get
          missing macros (ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN, ACE_TRACE).

        * apps/JAWS/clients/Caching/http_client.cpp:

Wed Sep  1 12:32:31 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (mutex_init):

          Explicitly cast the unused returned value of an
          ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL macro call to "void" to address a "right-hand
          operand of comma has no effect" warning exhibited by GNU g++
          3.4.x.  Thanks to Bogdan Jeram <bjeram at eso dot org> and
          Paul Lew <paullew@cisco.com> for reporting the warning.

Wed Sep  1 11:35:44 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/config_h.m4:

          Removed ACE_UINT64_FORMAT_SPECIFIER autoheader template.  It
          is now defined within ACE_CHECK_FORMAT_SPECIFIERS.

        * m4/platforms.m4:

          Added new macro ACE_CHECK_FORMAT_SPECIFIERS, which is used to
          define preprocessor macros that overide the defaults provided
          for size_t, ssize_t, ACE_INT64, and ACE_UINT64 *printf format
          specifiers.  I don't think autoconf feature tests are possible,
          especially if we ever hope to support cross compilation, but at
          least this pulls everything into one place.

Wed Sep  1 12:52:40 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/AutomakeWorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Split out the ACE specific portion of AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm
          into a new helper module.  The helper module is dynamically loaded
          in by the AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.

Wed Sep  1 10:01:57 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp:

          Added !defined(__NetBSD__) to conditional so sockaddr.sa_len
          version of the code will be used.  Fixes SOCK_Bcast_Dgram_Test
          failures.

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:

          Added !defined(__NetBSD__) to conditional so sockaddr.sa_len
          version of the code will be used.

Wed Sep  1 12:40:28 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Changed the ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_WCSTOK test to
          include _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500, not == 500. Fixes compile error
          on AIX 5.2.

Wed Sep  1 12:45:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dump_T.cpp:
          Added include of config-all.h to get ACE_TRACE

Wed Sep  1 07:43:46 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Message_Queue_Notifications_Test.cpp (producer): Fixed
          this test so it works with the changes to
          ACE_Message_Queue::is_full_i() below.  Thanks to Rick Robinson
          for this fix, as well.

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.inl: Changed the implementation of
          is_full_i() so the comparision operator is >= rather than >,
          which makes it possible to use a 0 high water mark to disable
          the enqueue side of the queue.  Thanks to Rick Robinson
          <rick@oyarsa.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.h: Updated the documentation to use
          the right names for ACE_POSIX_SIG_Proactor and
          ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor.  Thanks to John D. Robertson
          <john@rrci.com> for motivating this fix.

Wed Sep  1 07:00:39 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          Disable the wince feature setting.

        * apps/FaCE/FaCE.mpc:
        * apps/FaCE/FaCENOACE.mpc:

          Adding mpc files to replace the vcp files.  These projects will
          only build on wince so they require the wince feature which is
          disabled by default.

        * apps/FaCE/FaCE.vcp:
        * apps/FaCE/FaCE.vcw:
        * apps/FaCE/FaCENOACE.vcp:
        * apps/FaCE/FaCENOACE.vcw:

          Removed these files.

Wed Sep  1 06:48:34 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Mem_Map/file-reverse/Mem_Map_File_Reverse.mpc:

          With the current version of MPC, we must specify the exename for
          this project.  MPC no longer automatically determines that
          ACE_TMAIN is the entry point.

Wed Sep  1 10:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Added several new defines, these are gathered by comparing an
          autoconf generated config.h and the original file. It seems HPUX
          has much more stuff than we currently use. Everything is tested
          on HPUX 11i v2, maybe it breaks older versions, I don't think so
          but if it will, our daily builds will trigger this and we have
          to make the defines than dependent on the HPUX version. Added are:
          ACE_HAS_NEW_NO_H, ACE_HAS_AUTOMATIC_INIT_FINI,
          ACE_HAS_LONG_MAP_FAILED, ACE_HAS_MEMCHR,
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS, ACE_HAS_POSIX_GETPWNAM_R,
          ACE_HAS_P_READ_WRITE, ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_THR_EXIT_SEMANTICS,
          ACE_LACKS_PRI_T, ACE_HAS_SIG_C_FUNC, ACE_HAS_SIGSUSPEND,
          ACE_HAS_SOCKLEN_T, ACE_HAS_SYS_ERRLIST, ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_MMAP,
          ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_SOCKOPT, ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE_PROTOTYPE, ACE_HAS_TIMOD_H,
          ACE_HAS_SYS_XTI_H, ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_RESUME_NP. If you don't agree to
          one of these defines, let us know, then we also have some work on
          the autoconf support, because autoconf gave info all these can be
          setup.

Tue Aug 31 14:38:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_errno.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_errno.h: Include config-lite.h instead of
          config-all.h to minimize re-includes.

        * ace/OS_NS_errno.inl: Include config-all.h to pick up ACE_TRACE.

Tue Aug 31 08:36:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_STD_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_SPECIALIZATION for the HP aCC
          compiler

Tue Aug 31 08:16:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.cpp:
          When ACE_LACKS_NATIVE_STRPTIME is defined, include

Tue Aug 31 00:21:48 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.h:
        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h:

          Removed vestigial ACE_HAS_LAZY_V definition.

        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.h:
        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h:

          Removed vestigial ACE_HAS_IOMANIP_NO_H definition.

Mon Aug 30 23:57:58 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:
        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.h:
        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h:

          Removed vestigial ACE_HAS_SYS_IOCTL_H definition.  ACE now uses
          ACE_LACKS_SYS_IOCTL_H.

        * ace/config-integritySCA.h:

          Removed vestigial ACE_LACKS_SYS_FILE_H definition.

Mon Aug 30 23:47:41 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added check for ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER and ACE_LACKS_TOWUPPER.

Mon Aug 30 23:39:33 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Changed check for libc.h and osfcn.h to not export a feature
          test macro definition, as the results are only needed within
          the configure script itself.

Mon Aug 30 23:28:03 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-macos.h:
        * ace/config-macos-panther.h:

          definitions.

          ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP.

Mon Aug 30 22:39:24 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * tests/TSS_Test.cpp:

          Changed the number of iterations from 100 to 25 so the test will
          run on systems with pthreads with the minimum required number of
          thread keys (128).  This should still be sufficient to check the
          TSS wrappers without exceeding the minimum requirements.

Mon Aug 30 18:31:28 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Add ACE_SSIZE_T_FORMAT_SPECIFIER and ACE_SIZE_T_FORMAT_SPECIFIER
          definitions for NetBSD/amd64.

        * netsvcs/clients/Logger/Makefile.am:

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile.am:
        * netsvcs/servers/Makefile.am:

          Fix the _LDADD definitions that MPC doesn't get right yet.

        * configure.ac:

          Added checks for: ACE_LACKS_STRCHR, ACE_LACKS_STRCSPN,

          ACE_LACKS_STRTOD, ACE_LACKS_STRTOL, ACE_LACKS_STRTOUL,
          and ACE_LACKS_SWAB.

          Added check for ACE_HAS_STRNLEN.

          Added checks for: ACE_LACKS_ARPA_INET_H, ACE_LACKS_DIRENT_H,

Mon Aug 30 17:38:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        Changes that get PocketPC/WinCE back into a state where they build.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h: Add ACE_LACKS_ASSERT_H, ACE_LACKS_SEARCH_H,
          and ACE_LACKS_WCHAR_H for WinCE 3.
          Add ACE_LACKS_SWAB for all versions.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h: Set (or clear) ACE_LACKS_RTTI based on
          whether or not the compiler switch to enable rtti is used.

        * ace/OS_Errno.{h inl}:
        * ace/OS_NS_errno.{h inl}: Moved ACE_CE_Errno from OS_Errno to
          OS_NS_errno. This seems like a more sensible place for an errno
          replacement, and avoids having to add includes for OS_Errno.h to
          a bunch of other files.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (rename): In the char* variant, always convert
          the names to wide-char for WinCE.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.{h cpp inl}: Don't attempt ACE_OS::realpath() for
          ACE_HAS_WINCE. It has no native support and there's no
          ACE_OS::getcwd() to fake it with.

        * ace/OS_NS_stropts.{h cpp}: The 9-arg version of ACE_OS::ioctl is
          ok for WinCE, but the ACE_QoS one is disabled. Changed both files
          to implement this. They were mismatched for CE.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_select.inl: Replace #include ace/os_include/os_errno.h
          with ace/OS_NS_errno.h to pick up errno correctly across all
          platforms.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.cpp: Moved #endif closing #ifndef ACE_HAS_WINCE
          to encompass join_leaf() to match what's done in the class decl.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (mkdir, stat): Added #include
          "ace/OS_NS_macros.h" to get ACE_ADAPT_RETVAL.
          For the char* mkdir() and stat(), CE needs to convert
          the strings to wide-char.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h: Moved the day_of_week and month_name const
          strings into the ACE_OS namespace, as OS_NS_time.cpp desires.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.cpp: Removed the MT-only compile block around the
          day_of_week and month_name arrays. As suspected by Don Hinton,
          this is an incorrect condition.
          Also added #include "ace/OS_NS_stdio.h" for ACE_HAS_WINCE, as the
          ctime_r emulation needs it.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (unlink): Convert path to wide-char for WinCE.
          (rmdir): RemoveDirectory() takes only 1 arg.
          wide-char getcwd() is a NOTSUP for WinCE, as is the char* version.

        * ace/Proactor.cpp: Add #include "ace/config-lite.h" since the
          user config is needed to decide whether to compile this file.
          Also remove 'tv' param name from the stubbed-out version of
          run_event_loop(ACE_Time_Value&).

Mon Aug 30 16:24:51 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * NEWS: Noted that the wide-char stuff is done and autoconf is in
          progress.

Mon Aug 30 11:54:01 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/security.mpb:

          Added missing "interceptors" and "corba_messaging" base
          projects.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ssliop.mpb:

          Added missing "interceptors" base project.

Mon Aug 30 13:02:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h: Don't use sizeof() when defining ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR.
          Other code (e.g. ACEXML) in ACE uses ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR in
          preprocessor tests, so it needs to be a preprocessor constant.
          If the config file doesn't set it, and on an XPG4 system, set
          the size to 4. If it's wrong, Basic_Types_Test will catch it.

        * tests/Basic_Types_Test.cpp: Remove the comment that says the check
          for ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR is pointless. It's now important.

Mon Aug 30 10:05:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/amh.mpb:

Sun Aug 29 16:53:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

        Added '__GLIBC_MINOR__ < 2' test for setting ACE_POLL_IS_BROKEN
        on Alpha platform.

Fri Aug 27 11:40:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/ftrtevent.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/portablegroup.mpb:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/rtsched.mpb:

          framework entrypoints (init(), etc.) to match ACE_TCHAR* instead of
          char*. Also corrected char-width problems and naked text literals.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp: Fixed uninitialized variable.

Fri Aug 27 08:18:21 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/footprint_stats.sh:

          Fixed the path to the libraries. Thanks to Johnny for spotting
          the error in the scoreboard.

Fri Aug 27 10:20:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/security.mpb:
          Security library uses valuetype, so added valuetype as base

Fri Aug 27 09:06:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/loadbalancing.mpb:
          Loadbalancing uses iorinterceptor, so added that as base

Fri Aug 27 08:06:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Integrated ORTrefactor_2 branch into main. Previously the PortableServer
        library was dependent on IORInterceptor, ObjRefTemplate and Valuetype,
        this dependency has been removed. PortableServer doesn't use these libs
        anymore, but IORInterceptor, ObjRefTemplate and Valuetype are now
        dependent on PortableServer. This will reduce the size of corba servers
        which don't use IORInterceptor, ObjRefTemplate and Valuetype.

        This are the needed MPC changes. Without MPC this would have been a
        hard job to change all makefiles by hand.

        Fri Aug 20 13:18:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

                * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portableserver.mpb:
                * tao/PortableServer.mpc:
                  PortableServer is not dependent on ValueType anymore, so removed it
                  as base project

        Fri Aug 20 11:47:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

                * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/iorinterceptor.mpb:
                  When using iorinterceptor use portableserver and objreftemplate

                * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/objreftemplate.mpb:
                  When using objreftemplate, you must use portableserver

                * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portableserver.mpb:
                  When using portableserver there is no need to use objreftemplate and
                  iorinterceptor

Fri Aug 27 07:40:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace_wchar.h:

        Fixed for broken OpenVMS build because of missing <cwchar>
        and <cwctype> includes.

Thu Aug 26 19:55:03 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Fixed thinko in last change.  CVS and .svn directories *and*
          their contents must be pruned in install-local-data target.

Thu Aug 26 19:37:10 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Changed dist-hook and install-local-data targets to skip .svn as
          well as CVS directories to support subversion.

Thu Aug 26 19:22:31 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Added If_Then_Else.h to HEADER_FILES.

Thu Aug 26 11:53:26 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.h: Added extern "C++" around the ACE_Time_Value class
          declaration for WinCE. This is a total hack that I hate, but I have
          not been able to find any other way around it. The same code
          worked before the great ACE_OS reorg, but I don't know what tickled
          it to start misbehaving. Without the hack, eVC complains that
          the operators are C functions and so can't return a class.

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{cpp h}: Inserted /**/ in #include directives
          to silence MSVC warnings that the files are missing dependencies.

Thu Aug 26 11:39:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACEXML/common/XML_Types.h: Add #include "ace/Basic_Types.h" to
          pick up ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR.

Thu Aug 26 12:22:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Tru64 also provides sysconf functionality to retrieve number
          of cpu's. Implemented ACE_OS::num_processors() and
          ACE_OS::num_processors_online() for Tru64 (Digital Unix)

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Corrected copy/paste error

Thu Aug 26 11:54:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Added test for ACE_OS::num_processors() and
          ACE_OS::num_processors_online()

Thu Aug 26 09:23:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          I know we are working on footprint, but stating that an entire
          build of ACE/TAO could use more than 2MB of diskspace is an
          understatement ;-). Updated this to could use more than 4GB of
          diskspace, which is something we have seen on the 64 bit systems.
          Also updated the peak memory usage from 256Mb to 512Mb, the
          Notification Service is a very memory consuming services when
          being build.

Thu Aug 26 09:16:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Updated instructions to build SSL with Borland C++, no OpenSSL
          patch is necessary anymore and now MPC must be used. Updated HPUX
          supported platforms.

Thu Aug 26 07:58:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          Included check on defined(__alpha) for correctly setting 64 bit
          format specifiers.

        * examples/Threads/cancel.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Synch-Benchmarks/Perf_Test/Benchmark_Performance.cpp:

          Fixed 64 bit conversion warnings.

Thu Aug 26 06:47:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Auto_Ptr.h:
          Readded disappeared include of post.h

Wed Aug 25 23:31:02 2004  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:

          Fixed an error caused by a misplaced newline in Rich's previous
          commit.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:

          Brought over the following changes from OCITAO 1.3a.
          Added -ladm to LIBS.  This is needed for SunOS 5.6 for
          resolving symbols for regular expression processing (e.g.,
          compile, step), and does not appear to cause a problem on
          later version of SunOS.

          Change directory that is argument to ld's '-R' to use the new
          $ACE_ROOT/lib directory rather than $ACE_ROOT/ace.

Wed Aug 25 21:10:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Fixed tipo introduced by:
          Mon Aug 23 23:23:18 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

Wed Aug 25 17:33:47 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Removed ACE_NTRACE definition.  It slipped in again.

Wed Aug 25 16:00:11 2004  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Auto_Ptr.inl:

          Added new ACE_Auto_Ptr which can be used more portably than
          auto_ptr even with the ACE auto_ptr workarounds. Specifically,
          this obviates the need for the ACE_AUTO_PTR_RESET macro, and
          will have better performance than the pre-standard auto_ptr that
          comes with VC6.

Wed Aug 25 14:58:51 2004  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

      * include/makeincludes/platform_linux.GNU:
        Generalized the way the rt library is searched.  The
        previous code did not find it on RedHat AS 3.0 for opteron.

Wed Aug 25 14:49:11 2004  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
        added __x86_64 to long double to satisy opteron.

Wed Aug 25 11:15:33 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Updated ACE_SSL library build notes to refer to MPC, i.e. the
          proper way to add ACE_SSL support to GNUmakefiles and MSVC++
          workspace/project files.  Thanks to Johnny for pointing out that
          the documentation was out of date.

          Wrap the "Last modified" line within an Emacs "hhtms" block to
          allow Emacs to automatically update the date and time this file
          was last modified.

Wed Aug 25 11:46:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_pstat.h: If ACE_HAS_SYS_PSTAT_H, include
          <sys/param.h> and <sys/pstat.h> (not <time.h>) as directed by
          HP-UX man page. HP-UX 11 is the only config that sets this.

Wed Aug 25 08:46:02 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Fixed the ace_filecache misspelling.

Wed Aug 25 08:38:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (rmdir): Removed the ACE_USES_WCHAR case from
          the char* version of this method.

Wed Aug 25 09:36:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Minor updates to Cygwin notes

Wed Aug 25 09:04:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_pstat.h:
          Corrected incorrect doxygen file tag

Wed Aug 25 08:47:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-lite.h:

          Introduced new macro ACE_HAS_PROCESS_SPAWN to be able to do
          better checks for availability of subprocessing than is
          possible with ACE_LACKS_FORK. See [Bug 1793].

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Malloc_Test.cpp
        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast_Test.cpp

          Changed to use new ACE_HAS_PROCESS_SPAWN macro to test for
          subprocessing capabilities. See [Bug 1793].

Wed Aug 25 01:19:03 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Add checks for ACE_HAS_SYS_PSTAT_H and ACE_HAS_SYS_LOADAVG_H.

Wed Aug 25 08:17:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          The warnings disabled in this file are for major version 03 of aCC
          only (PA-RISC), for version 05 (Itanium), disable 1016 and 1031,
          these are binary incompatible warnings.

Wed Aug 25 07:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_loadavg.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_pstat.h:
          New files to include sys/loadavg.h and sys/pstat.h when
          ACE_HAS_SYS_LOADAVG_H and ACE_HAS_SYS_PSTAT_H is set

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          HPUX has sys/pstat.h, so added define ACE_HAS_SYS_PSTAT_H

        * ace/README:
          Documented ACE_HAS_SYS_LOADAVG_H and ACE_HAS_SYS_PSTAT_H

        * ace/OS.h:
          Removed including of sys/pstat.h, it is really not needed here

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:
          Instead of including sys/pstat.h include os_include/sys/os_pstat.h

Wed Aug 25 07:04:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Changed CXXVERS to CXXMINORVERS and added CXXMAJORVERS,
          we just compare minor version at this moment, but we really
          should also check major vers soon, major version 3 is aCC
          on PARISC, version 5 is on Itanium. Changed the way we
          detect itanium to a portable way that works with all
          HPUX versions.

Tue Aug 24 19:59:18 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Fixed typo in last change, add back typedef for ACE_UINT64.

Tue Aug 24 19:32:07 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Removed extraneous cruft left over from autoheader generated
          file.  Added conditional support for NetBSD/AMD64.

Tue Aug 24 15:03:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (thread_mutex_init): Fixed wchar_t version to
          pass a 0 sa value. Corrects the passing of the lock_type value
          through to ACE_OS::mutex_init(), restoring behavior of recursive
          mutexes.

Tue Aug 24 14:07:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        Changes to improve the functionality of wide-char operation on
        non-Windows platforms:

        * ace/ace_wchar.h: If ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR is defined, but not
          ACE_HAS_WCHAR, set ACE_HAS_WCHAR.

        * ace/ACE.cpp (timestamp): Use ACE_TCHAR for temp char arrays,
          not char. If ACE_USES_WCHAR on non-Windows, use %ls for printf
          strings, not %s.

        * ace/ARGV.cpp (constructor): Replaced most of the body with a call
          to ACE_OS::argv_to_string().

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
        * ace/Cleanup.h:
        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_string.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_float.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_inttypes.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_limits.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stdint.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_stdlib.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_time.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_ucontext.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_ipc.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_mman.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_msg.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_resource.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_select.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_sem.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_shm.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_statvfs.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_timeb.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_time.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_times.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_types.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_uio.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_un.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_utsname.h:
        * ace/os_include/sys/os_wait.h: #include "config-lite.h" rather than
          "config-all.h". Only need the user config.h and "lite" things.
          Including config-all.h introduces a circular include
          dependency from OS_main.h.

        * ace/Default_Constants.h: Add ACE_LIB_TEXT() to ACE_DEFAULT_SVC_CONF
          strings.

        * ace/Env_Value_T.i (fetch_value): For non-Win32, force the env var
          name to narrow-char then convert the result back to ACE_TCHAR.

        * ace/FILE_Connector.cpp (connect): When generating a temp name,
          convert it to ACE_TCHAR for ACE_FILE_Addr.

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp (constructor): When checking for POSIXLY_CORRECT,
          must always use char *, not ACE_TCHAR*, on non-Win32.

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp: Added ACE_LIB_TEXT to naked string literals.
          Use 'char' when it must be narrow char; ACE_TCHAR when it has to
          change based on ACE_USES_WCHAR.

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp (ldfind, get_temp_dir): Environment variables on
          non-Windows are always narrow char, so account for that.

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp: Operate internally with all narrow
          chars because the underlying OS APIs are only narrow char.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): For 'D', 'M', 'm', 'N', and 'p', use the
          proper 's' format code for the platform/char width. Similar to
          Log_Record.cpp below.

        * ace/Log_Msg.h (ACE_ASSERT): Convert __FILE__ name to proper char
          width when necessary.

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp: When formatting log strings, have to change
          printf formats if using wide chars on non-Windows. Wide-char
          strings are printed with %ls, whereas Windows uses %s for
          wide-char strings if the format is wide-char.

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp (ctor): Change backing_store_name to narrow
          char when needed to pass it to sscanf().

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp (print_error_message): Add
          ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR to the message arg to convert on wide-char
          builds.

        * ace/OS_main.h: For ACE_MAIN on non-Windows ACE_USES_WCHAR platforms,
          convert the argv to wchar_t, and pass the wide-char strings to the
          ACE_TCHAR[]-expecting real main program.

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl (opendir): Moved the const_cast-needing
          VxWorks part to its own #elif section. Added ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR
          to the other invocation of ::opendir().

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl (dlerror, dlopen, dlsym): Corrected use of
          narrow/wide-char.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (cuserid, fdopen, freopen): Don't use
          ACE_TCHAR when a char is always needed.
          (fgets, fputs, perror, puts): Changed to have both narrow- and
          wide-char variants.
          (checkUnicodeFormat): Use a platform-neutral 2-byte type to
          read 2 bytes. Need a non-Windows 'whence' arg for fseek().
          (vsprintf (wchar_t)): Added the non-Windows, XPG5 code for this to
          use the XPG5 vswprintf() when equippped.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.{h inl cpp}:
          (ACE_OS::mktemp() and mkstemp()): Changed to have both narrow-
          and wide-char variants for the !ACE_LACKS_MKTEMP case.
          Offering both for the ACE_LACKS_MKTEMP case is a low-return
          use of time since the wide-char variant will probably never be used.
          (strenvdup): Handle ACE_USES_WCHAR on non-Windows by converting
          back and forth to narrow-char.
          (system): On non-Windows, convert command line string to narrow-char.
          (getcwd): Changed to have both narrow- and wide-char variants.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (creat, mkfifo): For non-Windows, convert
          name to narrow-char when needed.
          (lstat): Change from a single ACE_TCHAR-based interface to both
          char* and wchar_t*.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl (ctime, ctime_r): Corrected narrow/wide char
          usage.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (truncate): For non-Windows, convert the path
          to narrow-char when needed.
          (realpath): Changed to have both narrow- and wide-char variants.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.{h inl cpp}:
          (rmdir): Changed to have both narrow- and wide-char variants.
          (argv_to_string): Handle narrow and wide-char environment variables.
          (fork_exec): Convert path and argv to narrow-char when needed.

        * ace/Process.cpp (spawn): Convert argv, procname, env vars to narrow
          char for non-Windows wide-char builds.

        * ace/Process.i (setreugid): Convert user name to narrow char for
          getpwnam().

        * ace/Process_Mutex.cpp (ctor): Don't convert name to ACE_TCHAR for
          ACE_SV_Semaphore case - it requires char*.

        * ace/Process_Semaphore.cpp (ctor): Convert name to narrow char
          for ACE_SV_Semaphore_Complex case.

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp (get_bcast_addr):
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (mk_broadcast): Host name needs to be
          converted to narrow-char for wide-char builds.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp (make_multicast_ifaddr): Interface name
          needs to be converted to narrow-char for wide-char builds.

        * ace/SV_Semaphore_Simple.{h,i,cpp}: Added wide-char versions of
          the named constructor and open() methods. They forward to the
          narrow-char versions.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp: Account for dirent's d_name is an ACE_TCHAR
          when ACE_LACKS_STRUCT_DIR and a char* otherwise.

        * tests/FIFO_Test.cpp: Change ACE_ALPHABET to char[].

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp: Change complete_message from ACE_TCHAR
          to char. This is easier to handle; as ACE_TCHAR, we'd need to
          correct all the message block pointer adjustments to take the
          charset width into account.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:
        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp:

        * tests/SOCK_Connector_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Send_Recv_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SOCK_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SV_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp: Char width correction.

        * tests/Service_Config_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Service_Config_Test.WCHAR_T.conf:
        * tests/Service_Config_Test.WCHAR_T.conf.xml: Added WCHAR_T-coded
          versions of the test input file and changed the test to use
          them on non-Windows ACE_USES_WCHAR builds.

        * tests/Test_Output.cpp (set_output): Handle env var and filepath
          building correctly even on wide-char non-Windows builds.

        * ACEXML/common/XML_Types.h: typedef ACEXML_Char as ACE_TCHAR, else
          it doesn't match any char interfaces when wchar_t is not 2 bytes.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp (parse_char_reference): Add the
          case where wide-char is 4 bytes.

        Also brought in this fix:
        Mon Mar  8 15:52:33 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp: Comment out the signal setup; this should
          not be necessary and, indeed, is erroneous, at least on Linux.
          It's commented out instead of removed in case further testing on
          other platforms determines that it is needed sometimes.

Tue Aug 24 10:22:18 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: Added ACE_HAS_SCANDIR and a new
          macro, ACE_SCANDIR_CMP_USES_VOIDPTR, saying that scandir()
          cmp() function takes void pointers, not dirent pointers.

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl (scandir): When calling native scandir()
          with ACE_SCANDIR_CMP_USES_VOIDPTR, cast comparator appropriately.
          Also, for native scandir(), ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR the dirname.

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl:
        * tests/Test_Output.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to get
          ACE_OS string methods. Fixes compile error on inline=0 build.

Tue Aug 24 11:16:00 2004  Jules White   <jules@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Added a section on using ACE within Eclipse

Tue Aug 24 10:10:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-all.h: Moved #include "ace/OS_main.h" down to the bottom
          of the file, lest it invoke a circular dependency.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl: Added #include "ace/config-all.h" to get
          ACE_TRACE.

Mon Aug 23 23:23:18 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS):

          Removed required Automake version from `Makefile.am'.
          `configure.ac' already defines it.

        * configure.ac:

          Updated required version of Automake to 1.9.

          Added test for partial template specialization.  Issue a warning
          if it isn't support by the compiler since ACE will require it in
          the near future.

        * ace/ACE.h:

          Corrected ACE namespace documentation to describe the ACE
          namespace itself rather than summarizing the contents of this
          header (i.e. the value added global ACE functions).

        * ace/If_Then_Else.h:

          Doxygen documentation corrections and improvements.

Mon Aug 23 22:19:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/CDR_Test.cpp (run_main):

          Added run-time assertions that verify proper CDR type sizes
          (e.g. sizeof (ACE_CDR::Boolean) == 1).

Mon Aug 23 19:18:58 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/config_h.m4:

          Removed autoheader template for ACE_LACKS_PARAM_H.

Mon Aug 23 18:33:40 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added check for ACE_HAS_ITOA.
          Added check for ACE_LACKS_ITOW.

Mon Aug 23 18:22:25 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

          Changed name of feature test macro ACE_HAS_SOCKIO_H to
          ACE_HAS_SYS_SOCKIO_H.

Mon Aug 23 17:41:40 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/config_h.m4:
        * m4/platform.m4:

          Removed support for unused ACE_NETBSD feature test macro.

Mon Aug 23 17:37:16 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/platform.m4:

          Add check for ACE_LACKS_PERFECT_MULTICAST_FILTERING.

Mon Aug 23 16:33:59 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Remove PACKAGE, PACKAGE_*, and VERSION definitions.  The latter
          conflicts with some of the test/example programs.  I'll get rid
          of the others just to be safe.

          Comment out ACE_NTRACE, as the constant definition conflicts
          with Misc_test_trace.  We probably need an option to control
          whether tracing and debugging features are enabled when ACE/
          TAO is compiled that is separate from the one used after it
          has been built.

Mon Aug 23 16:06:39 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Added checks for ACE_HAS_VWFPRINTF and ACE_HAS_VWSPRINTF.

Tue Aug 24 00:34:30 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

        * ace/QtReactor.cpp:
        Removed unecessary #include <qeventloop.h>. Thanks to
        Gan Deng <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu> for a patch.


Mon Aug 23 17:53:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Added support for itanium on HPUX 11iv2 (11.23). Different options
          have to be passed when on itanium, so when version 11.23 is detected,
          set itanium to 1 and dependent on that set different compiler options.

Mon Aug 23 16:58:18 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <don.hinton@vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added CCFLAGS to the list of arguments passed to the dependency
          generator.  Thanks to Matthew Townsend <mtownsen@harris.com>
          for reporting the problem.

        * THANKS:
          Added Matthew Townsend to the hall of fame.

Mon Aug 23 08:34:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux11.h:
          Removed this file from the repo, use config-hpux-11.00.h instead,
          the contents of this file refers to config-hpux11-xx.h files
          which are not there, making this file unusable.

Sun Aug 22 21:49:14 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Update with autoconf generated results.  While not perfect, the
          old version would be difficult to update by hand.

Mon Aug 23 01:04:34 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:

          Made some slight changes to the BUG 1890 patch after receiving
          some clarifications from Kobi.

Sun Aug 22 11:11:00 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/amh.mpb:
          When using amh, you must have valuetype support, so add valuetype
          as base project of amh

Sun Aug 22 09:53:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:

          Changed to remove compile warning resulting from bad use
          of ACE_UNUSED_ARG().

Fri Aug 20 15:29:29 MST 2004  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

         * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
         * tests/run_test.pl:
           Changed the run test scripts to time the execution
           and print test finished messages.  This for the
           generation of statistics.

Fri Aug 20 15:10:08 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core.mpb:

          Changed to define INSTALL_THIS_TARGET for automake builds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taodefaults.mpb:

          Changed to add $(TAO_BUILDDIR) to includes for automake builds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Changed to add $(ACE_BUILDDIR) to includes for automake builds.

Fri Aug 20 10:22:34 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * TAO/tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:
          Revert this.  It wasn't supposed to be included in my previous
          check in. (Thu Aug 19 12:42:19 2004)

Fri Aug 20 15:20:31 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        Fixes for Bug 1890. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1890

        for details of this bug. What follows are the individual changes.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:

          Added a new method clear_dispatch_mask (), which as the name
          indicates clears the masks in the dispatch_set. The dispatch set
          is a new addition, which keeps track of the handles that can be
          used for dispatching.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.inl:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.h: Modified dispatch_io_set () so that it
          doesn't break the loop when state_changes occur. This is the
          crux of the 1890 bug report. If unbinding occurs as part of an
          upcall, the bit_ops () calls clear_dispatch_mask (), which
          prevents dispatching to already removed (and potentially
          rebounded) handles.

          Additional cosmetic changes.

        * ace/Priority_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Priority_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.inl:

          Replicate changes to the above reactors.

        * ace/Signal.h:
        * ace/Signal.inl:

          Added a default argument to the ACE_Signal class, which is used
          by the ACE_Select_Reactor.

          Thanks to Kobi for the patches.

Fri Aug 20 14:26:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Changed to use a separate logfile per child (based on PID like
          in MEM_Stream_Test) because of concurrency problems in using a
          single non-synchronized child logfile (at least under windows).

Fri Aug 20 14:10:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:

          Changed to use child processes instead of threads for testing.
          See also [Bug 1793].

Fri Aug 20 07:47:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added $(EXEEXT) to BIN build target.
          Removed from $(EXEEXT) from install and cleanup target
          because these are derived from build target.
          This improves link behaviour (disables unnecessary links
          because dependency checks on build targets did not function)
          on platforms using GNU make and having a executable extension
          (like MingW; .exe).
          Fixes [Bug 1876].

        * apps/gperf/tests/tests.mpc:

          Added $(EXEEXT) to verbatim 'runtests' targets because
          otherwise dependencies on build targets do not function
          anymore.

Thu Aug 19 16:45:05 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/security.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from orbsvcslib.

Thu Aug 19 12:42:19 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * TAO/tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
        Repeat part of the checkin from Fri Aug 13 15:26:40 2004
        This corrects the incorrect thread-in-use count problem
        that leads to premature TSS key deletion, but does not fix
        the TSS leak because fixing that reveals other problems
        that I don't have a solution for, yet.

Thu Aug 19 08:26:11 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * apps/drwho/Rwho_DB_Manager.h:

          Changed to #include <sys/types.h> before <protocols/rwhod.h>,
          as the latter needs the former on some systems.

Thu Aug 19 08:07:53 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigAction.cpp:

          Changed to use a (conditional) extern "C" linkage block around
          my_sighandler, because the plain extern "C" directive resulted
          in a declaration with multiple storage classes.

Thu Aug 19 08:44:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:
          Ask for the default.features file used by MPC.

Wed Aug 18 21:02:34 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Revert TSS leak fix (temporarily, I hope)
          until I can find and eliminate the hang.

Wed Aug 18 15:07:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:
          bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

        Fixed wrong comment characters.

Wed Aug 18 13:35:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:

        Added support for building VC8 projects.

Wed Aug 18 13:29:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

        Added support for building VC8 projects.

Wed Aug 18 08:50:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        * ace/Asynch_Connector.h:
        * ace/Asynch_Connector.cpp:

          Thanks to Douglas for his assistance. This change introduces a
          class-static "local_default" for use as the default parameter
          for the second attribute of
          ACE_Asynch_Connector<>::connect(). This "simplifies" the nested
          templated class for the Solaris Lynxos GCC295 cross compiler
          which was faulting due to the complexity of this
          definition. This change does not appreachiably modify the
          signature of the member function, just stops clients from having
          to create their own local default parameter.

Wed Aug 18 01:05:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_netbsd.GNU:

          Update to support current NetBSD platforms.

Tue Aug 17 21:03:08 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/interceptors.mpb:

          New file, with base project requiring interceptors.  Project
          files should inherit from this instead of providing explicit
          requires statements to eliminate duplicate entries in list.

Tue Aug 17 17:42:16 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcosscheduler.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from orbsvcslib.

Tue Aug 17 09:50:46 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb:

          Added the path to $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs to the CIDL compiler.

Tue Aug 17 14:30:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp
          Revertion of change to this file (for the sake of being complete).

Tue Aug 17 13:00:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>
        * ace/Asynch_Connector.h
          Revertion of change to this file as it breaks the windows build and
          changed the public interface of the template class.

Tue Aug 17 10:03:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG() to is_sock_error() for non-WIN32
          builds.

Tue Aug 17 09:43:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:

          Removed DOS style linefeeds.

Tue Aug 17 08:49:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_String.cpp:

          Removed some hidden characters causing compile problems.

Tue Aug 17 08:00:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>
        * ace/Asynch_Connector.h
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp
          Due to a long standing fatal cross development compiler bug in the
          Solaris -> Lynxos cross development environment.
          (LynxOS gcc 2.95.3 cross compiler)

Tue Aug 17 08:00:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE.h:
          ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added ACE::is_sock_error() to be able to test if errorcode is
          WinSock error *before* converting to error string.

        * ace/OS_NS_String.cpp:

          Fixed WCHAR bug in ACE_OS::strerror().
          Introduced use of ACE::is_sock_error().

Mon Aug 16 22:53:53 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (~ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream):

          Removed useless invalidation of "ssl_" pointer member by
          assignment of zero.  Once the destructor is called, the object
          no longer exists so invalidation is unnecessary.

Mon Aug 16 16:54:18 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftorbutils.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/smart_proxies.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/svc_utils.mpb

          Changed to inherit from orbsvcslib instead of taolib_with_idl.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:

          Added $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs to includes.
          Added -I$(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs to idlflags.

Mon Aug 16 15:58:21 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Signal.cpp: Added template instantiations for
          ACE_Fixed_Set_Iterator_Base. Related to:
          Mon Aug  2 08:55:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

Mon Aug 16 15:30:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Task.cpp (svc_run): Added "defined (ACE_WIN32)" to the
          "defined (__IBMCPP__)" test for how to cast a thread result.
          __IBMCPP__ is defined for both Windows (where the alternate cast
          is needed) and AIX (where it is prohibited).
          This is related to this change:

Mon Aug 16 11:54:50 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h (debug):

          Corrected the export qualifier for these functions.  They are no
          longer inlined.

Mon Aug 16 11:16:02 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h:

          Moved remaining ACE namespace variables out of header and into
          the '.cpp' file.  They should not be accessed/modified
          directly.

        * ace/ACE.inl (hex_chars_, nibble2hex):

          No need to declare/define the hex_chars_ constant variable in
          the ACE namespace.  Define it as a static constant in the
          nibble2hex() function instead, the only place it is used.

        * ace/ACE.cpp (debug):

          Unlined these functions.  They generally aren't performance
          critical, and doing so allows us to remove the ACE::debug_
          internal variable to the '.cpp' file.

Mon Aug 16 11:16:02 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added remaining missing DLL export qualifiers.  Fixes
          "unresolved external symbol" errors in MS Windows builds.

          Moved variables in ACE namespace that are internal to ACE into
          the '.cpp' file.  They should be not be accessed or modified
          directly.

Mon Aug 16 10:58:09 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h (recv):

          Fixed DLL export qualifier.  Addresses "unresolved external
          symbol" link-time errors in MS Windows builds.

Mon Aug 16 12:14:37 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_svnt.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_server_dnc.mpb:

          Changed the names of the Deployment libraries. Arranged the
          dependencies in such a manner so that it is easier to use it in
          the application.

Mon Aug 16 09:27:12 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

           Added MSVC 7.1 compatibility through '-vc7' option.

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:

          Added MSVC 7.1 compatibility through '-vc7' option. Added
          support for MPC '-name_modifier' option.

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.lst:

          Removed projectfile extensions to be able to generate these
          dynamically from 'msvc_static_compile.pl'.

Sat Aug 14 19:38:20 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          Do not include "ace/If_Then_Else.h" when using MSVC++ 6.  It
          can't handle the partial template specializations in that file.

Sat Aug 14 19:34:02 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp (ipv6_enabled_):

          Fixed syntax error.

Sat Aug 14 13:07:50 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/QoS/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.cpp (subscribe_ifs):

          The "ACE_Sock_Connect" interim pseudo namespace no longer
          exists.  Use the true "ACE" C++ namespace instead.  Fixes a
          compile-time error.

Sat Aug 14 14:48:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Add /usr/lib as a path for library check. If the location of the
          library is not specified by the application, the compiler,
          linker and loader knows where to look in for *nix based
          systems. So should our library checker.Without this applications
          MPC file starts pointing to /usr/lib to locate libraries like
          PCAP and XERCES, which can be installed with system
          libraries. It is bad to see installation specific thingies
          making its way up the order.

Sat Aug 14 09:28:19 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          MSVC++ 6 can't handle partial template specializations so fall
          back on an unsigned char typedef if _MSC_VER < 1300 (i.e. MSVC++
          version is less than 7).  This is an interim solution to get the
          MSVC++ 6 builds going again.

        * ace/IfThenElse.h:
        * ace/If_Then_Else.h:

          Renamed the former to the latter, including the class template
          defined within, to match ACE naming conventions.  Thanks to Doug
          for pointing this out.

Sat Aug 14 01:43:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR):

          Parenthesize boolean condition that is the first argument to the
          ACE::IfThenElse<> template to avoid any potential confusion.

Sat Aug 14 00:33:59 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/IfThenElse.h (IfThenElse):

          Place sample code within a Doxygen code block.  Addresses some
          documentation formatting problems.

Fri Aug 13 23:26:56 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/IfThenElse.h:

          New template that allows one to choose between two types at
          compile-time based on a boolean value.  This is basically the
          IfThenElse template described in the book "C++ Templates" by
          Vandevoorde and Josuttis.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          Detect at compile-time whether the C++ "bool" type can be used
          as the underlying ACE_CDR::Boolean type using the new
          ACE::IfThenElse template.

        * ace/Sock_Connect.h:

          Functions that were in the pseudo "ACE" namespace are now in a
          true "ACE" C++ namespace.

        * ace/ACE.inl (log2):

          Use the prefix increment operator when incrementing the loop
          index.  It is generally more efficient than the postfix
          increment operator.

          Updated all calls to functions that were in the pseudo "ACE"
          namespace through a former ACE class base class
          (e.g. ACE_Sock_Connect, ACE_Flag_Manip, etc) to use the correct
          "ACE" namespace.  Use of the base class names should never have
          been used since it was known long ago that the "ACE" pseudo
          namespace would be changed to true C++ namespace.

Sat Aug 14 03:37:44 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Fixed a unused variable warning in the daily builds.

Sat Aug 14 01:58:32 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Release:

          Added the NEWS file to the release. Thanks to Ramiro Morales
          <rm0 at gmx dot net> for reporting the problem.

Fri Aug 13 16:17:32 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Module.h (class ACE_Module):
        * ace/Task.h (ACE_Task_Base):
          Updated the documentation so it's more clear.  Thanks to Andrew
          Athan <aathan-ace-bugs-1524@cloakmail.com> for motivating this.

        * ace/Stream.h: Updated the documentation for push() and pop() to
          clarify how it affects open() and close() hooks on the tasks.
          Thanks to Andrew Athan <aathan-ace-bugs-1524@cloakmail.com> for
          motivating this.

Fri Aug 13 15:26:40 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Pass the TSS key to ACE_OS::thr_key_detach.  This
          eliminates the table lookup formerly required to
          identify the key being detached.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
          --Accept and use the TSS key from TST_T.cpp
          --Typedef the function pointer used to delete TSS
          objects.  This improves readability.
          --Change the name of the ACE_TSS_Info member from
          tss_obj_ to tss_info_.  This avoids confusion
          due to conflicting use of the name "tss_obj"
          --Check to see if a thread has actually used
          a TSS key before decrementing the "number of
          threads using this key" counter.  This eliminates
          a messy situation in which the key is deleted
          while threads are still using it.
          --Fix bugzilla 1542:  Leaks in ACE_TSS
          Note that the patch suggested
          in the bugzilla report did not completely address
          the problem, so this fix takes a different approach.
          Significant features of this change:
          > The ACE_TSS_Cleanup::detach method now frees the
            thread's specified TSS entry.  Formerly it leaked it.
          > The exit method defers to the detach method to
            free the entry. This ensures entries are handled
            consistently -- no matter how they are freed up.
          > The ACE_TSS_Cleanup::in_use_ entry receives special
            handling to avoid using it while deleting it.  Formerly
            it was leaked, so it didn't matter.
          -- Note this does NOT address bugzilla 1797.  I'll
          look at that one next.

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
          Eliminating TSS leaks revealed another problem.  The
          main thread was not waiting for other threads to exit
          before dismantling the ACE infrastructure in
          Object_Manager::fini.  There's a hack in Thread_Manager
          that disables the wait method when the Object_Manager
          is shutting down.
          Unfortunatly this causes a messy race condition in which
          one thread is deleting objects while other threads are
          using them.
          The "solution" here is to call Thread_Manager::wait()
          with a short (1 second) timeout.  If the threads have
          already exited -- no problem, and no delay.  If they
          haven't, they get a chance to exit cleanly.

Fri Aug 13 18:43:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR):

          Reverted the usage of C++ bool as a typedef of
          ACE_CDR::Boolean. We will now use unsigned char on all
          platforms. MacOSX (Panther) atleast makes the size of bool to be
          4 bytes which creates problems for TAO. Thanks to Rich Shapiro
          <rshapiro at bbn dot com> for reporting the problem.

Fri Aug 13 18:44:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/IOStream_T.h:
          When ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_FX is defined, also include ace/os_include/
          os_ctype.h

Fri Aug 13 12:03:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Fri Aug 13 07:15:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Pass the def file with -Wl, to the compiler, it is a linker option
          and with the Cygwin GCC 3.3.3 it seems the compiler thinks the def
          file is a modula2 file. By marking it as linker option it works
          without problems again

        * etc/*.doxygen:
          Set INTERNAL_DOCS to YES, that way we generate documentation for
          stuff marked with @internal, but doxygen will make sure the
          documentation says it is for internal use only

Thu Aug 12 21:17:05 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

Thu Aug 12 07:54:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Removed support for buildbits=64 again, the way I tried it doesn't
          work

Wed Aug 11 22:20:49 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Priority of OS.h and Synch.h inclusions have been reduced.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcorbacommon.mpb
          Changed to inherit from minimum_corba instead of providing avoids

          with the modules in MPC.

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Put back the getBasePath() function and cleaned up the VMS
          support.

Wed Aug 11 10:32:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Don't run the PluggableUDP examples when NO_DIOP is defined,
          makes it possible to exclude these examples in builds that don't
          have DIOP

Wed Aug 11 08:32:12 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Process.cpp:
          Added OpenVMS version of ACE_Process::spawn().

        * include/makeinclude/platform-openvms.GNU:
          Removed mathlibrary from required libs.
          Added dummy code to circumvent 'touch' problem with OpenVMS make port.

Wed Aug 11 08:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          MINIMUM is set, this test isn't build with minimum corba

Tue Aug 10 10:57:00 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Enable check for ACE_HAS_WCHAR.  We'll never shake out any
          wide character configuration bugs that may remain if it's
          disabled.

Tue Aug 10 11:08:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: Removed ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER and
          ACE_LACKS_TOWUPPER. These functions are present but, I suspect,
          marked "lacks" because of type conflicts, which J.T. Conklin fixed:

        * configure.ac:
          Removed AC_LANG_PUSH([C])/.../AC_LANG_POP([C]) which forced the
          use of C for selected AC_CHECK_FUNC calls.  The current version
          of autoconf always uses C.

        I shouldn't have been rushed into these guarded #includes. The
        following two files now need these guarded #includes to be moved
        after the rest.

        * ace/FILE_IO.h
        * ace/FIFO_Send_Msg.h
          Moved guarded  #include "ace/OS_NS_stropts.h"  to end of other
          #includes

Tue Aug 10 11:20:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        * examples/IOStream/server/iostream_server.cpp
          Added missing  #include "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h"  inside the guard of
          #if defined (ACE_HAS_STRING_CLASS)

        * tests/IOStream_Test.cpp
          Added missing  #include "ace/OS_NS_unistd.h"  inside the guard of
          #if !defined (ACE_LACKS_ACE_IOSTREAM)

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          When DISABLE_BIDIR is set, don't run the BiDIR tests, this can be
          used for builds that build without BiDIR GIOP

        Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for the information
        leading to these guard conditions.

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
          Remove #define of ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER and ACE_LACKS_TOWUPPER.
          FreeBSD has these functions, but they were disabled because
          of the problem below.

        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_strings.cpp:

          ACE_OS::ace_toupper() and ACE_OS::ace_towupper() because they
          are ambiguous on systems where wint_t is in fact an int.  The
          same was done for ACE_OS::to_lower(), etc.

Mon Aug  9 18:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemen@remedy.nl>

          them in <unistd.h>, not <time.h>.

        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Replace some AH_TEMPLATE definitions.  ACE_CHECK_HAS_HEADERS and
          ACE_CHECK_LACKS_HEADERS provide autoheader templates themselves.

          Thanks to Boris Kaminer <boris_kaminer@mail.ru> for reporting
          this.

Fri Aug  6 08:03:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h:
          Added this file for msvc8, is a copy of msvc7 but this will change as
          things are tested for msvc8.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:
          If msvc_ver >= 1400 then we are including the msvc-8 file.

Thu Aug  5 23:50:38 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ec_use_typed_events.mpb:
          Changed to inherit from dynamicinterface and ifr_client instead
          of providing libs and after statements so that dependency chain
          is complete.

Thu Aug  5 13:17:26 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (sock_error): Changed the WSAEWOULDBLOCK message
          back to "resource temporarily unavailable" to be consistent with
          the UNIX error string.  Thanks to Boris Kaminer
          <boris_kaminer@mail.ru> for reporting this.

        * examples/NT_Service/ntsvc.{h,cpp}: Added a destructor to
          Service that cancels the timer.  Thanks to Scott Harris
          <harris_s@ociweb.com> for this fix.

        * ace/ACE.cpp (sock_error): Added support for WSAEISCONN.
          Thanks to Boris Kaminer <boris_kaminer@mail.ru> for reporting
          this.

Thu Aug  5 07:45:53 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Replace some AH_TEMPLATE definitions.  ACE_CHECK_HAS_FUNCS and
          ACE_CHECK_LACKS_FUNCS provide autoheader templates themselves.

        * configure.ac:
          Replace some calls to AC_CHECK_FUNCS with ACE_CHECK_HAS_FUNCS or
          ACE_CHECK_LACKS_FUNCS.

        * m4/ace_functions.m4:
          New file, with ACE_CHECK_HAS_FUNCS and ACE_CHECK_LACKS_FUNCS
          autoconf macros.  These macros are similar to AC_CHECK_FUNCS,
          but define either ACE_HAS_<foo> or ACE_LACKS_<foo>.

Thu Aug  5 09:21:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        The following changes are from Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/mwc.pl:
        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/depgen.pl:
        * bin/cle.pl:
          Added various changes to support autobuild MPC generation on
          OpenVMS.

Wed Aug  4 18:09:47 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/ace.m4:
        * configure.ac:
          Support --with/without-tao flag to provide find grain
          control over TAO configuration.

Wed Aug  4 16:19:40 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h (ACE_CORBA_1, ACE_CORBA_2, ACE_CORBA_3):

          Marked these macros as deprecated, and removed the version of
          these macros that defined the obsolete "CORBA_foo" broken
          namespace workaround classes.

Wed Aug  4 14:46:07 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * Makefile.am:
        * configure.ac:
          Configure TAO if TAO subdirectory is present.

Wed Aug  4 16:33:14 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:

          Fix for Bug 1893. Please see

          http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1893

          for details. Thanks to Alan L Batongbacal <alanlb at vt dot edu>
          for the patch.

Wed Aug  4 08:31:43 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: If the version of glibc
          is less than 2.1 add the ACE_HAS_NONCONST_MSGSND macro.  Thanks
          to Anand <anand@icmgworld.com> and Johnny Willemsen for this
          fix.

Tue Aug  3 15:25:43 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        From Jaroslaw Nozderko <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl>.
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (register_handler_i):

          Allow same handler to be registered with a different event,
          which is consistent with the other reactor implementations.

Tue Aug  3 13:04:24 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Svc_Handler.h:
        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp:
          Add throw() exception specifier to no-throw version of class
          local operator new.  In addition to squelching warnings from
          gcc, this tells the compiler to check the return value before
          constructing the object.

Tue Aug  3 08:55:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect trace macro

Tue Aug  3 08:22:10 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-aix-5.x.h:
          ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl (readdir_r): Added support for AIX and G++.
          Thanks to Raz Ben-Yehuda <raz.b@corigin.com>.

Tue Aug  3 11:56:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Updated location of TAO vc6 static project files

Tue Aug  3 06:19:06 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added macros in a specific section for the bmake project type.

Tue Aug  3 07:07:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Updated Borland templates to handle resource files in
          subdirectories, this is needed for the moving of the mpc
          files in TAO. Thanks to J.T. Conklin for making these
          patches.

Mon Aug  2 15:33:27 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp (ACE_Fixed_Set_Iterator::remove()): Had to
          qualify 'iterated_items_' with 'this->' to make it visible in this
          class now that iterated_items_ is in an inherited class. This per
          HP-UX aC++, citing [temp.dep], 14.6.2(3) in the C++ Standard.

Mon Aug  2 15:20:37 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Added #include
          "ace/os_include/os_stddef.h" to pick up size_t for platforms where
          it's not defined by the compiler, such as Cygwin. Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Mon Aug  2 08:55:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.h: The class ACE_Fixed_Set had some bugs in
          it's interface declaration and also some in it's implementation:
          1) typedef the wrong class for is constant iterator and
          2) its method size() misbehave in certain circumstances where
             elements were randomly deleted from a set object.
          Moreover, the iterators of ACE_Fixed_Set has a lot of code in
          common so the can be refactored to have a common abstract
          ancestor with all the shared code.  Therefore, refactored the
          three classes and fixed the bug on the size() method.  Thanks
          to J. Abelardo Gutierrez <jabelardo@cantv.net> for these fixes.

Mon Aug  2 09:06:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h: Removed the #include os_time.h - it's
          not needed for anything in this header, and for some reason, it
          introduces a type oddity on HP-UX - aC++ gets the idea there's a
          tentative struct sigaction and doesn't match the real one, causing
          compile errors in ACE_OS::sigaction().

        * ace/OS_TLI.h: Removed stray '#'.

        * ace/Signal.{h inl}: Removed the hack typedef ACE_SIGACTION that
          was allegedly put in for an HP-UX C++ bug. It's not needed and is
          causing further problems. #include "ace/os_include/os_signal.h"
          to get the needed signal-related types.

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Changed #include "ace/OS.h" to
          "ace/OS_NS_errno.h". Removing the "big hammer" OS.h stuff. This
          fixes a compile error in OS_TLI.inl on HP-UX w/ aC++. Why? I
          have no idea... there's something odd still about orders of
          includes and/or preprocessor defs or something. This odd compile
          error creeps up every once in a while and is always related to
          fudging something somewhere (see fix above for signal...) but
          this one doesn't have an apparant cause.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Removed AREXTRA. It
          was breaking static lib builds.

Sun Aug  1 08:15:23 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Moved subdirectory configuration above call to AC_OUTPUT.

        * ace/OS_Memory.h:
          Provide ACE_nothrow and ACE_nothrow_t definitions for platforms
          where definitions are not handled by special cases.

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added check for ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW.

Sun Aug  1 15:04:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/QoS/qos.mpc:
          Also with bmake set macros += ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2_GQOS

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
          Doxygen improvements/fixes

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Removed commented out lines

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
          Changed to signature for the to_string methods from char to
          ACE_CDR::char so that they match the implementation

Sun Aug  1 09:07:16 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-04a:

          Moved contents from this file to a new file.

Sat Jul 31 17:01:27 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_rel_manpages:

          This is now executed at tao.dre for generating doxygen
          documentation. The files are then scp'ed to the main website.

Sat Jul 31 11:13:20 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE version 5.4.2 released.
