	* ace/os_include/os_signal.h: Removed the #include os_time.h - it's
	  not needed for anything in this header, and for some reason, it
	  introduces a type oddity on HP-UX - aC++ gets the idea there's a
	  tentative struct sigaction and doesn't match the real one, causing
	  compile errors in ACE_OS::sigaction().

	* ace/Signal.{h inl}: Removed the hack typedef ACE_SIGACTION that
	  was allegedly put in for an HP-UX C++ bug. It's not needed and is
	  causing further problems. #include "ace/os_include/os_signal.h"
	  to get the needed signal-related types.

	* apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Changed #include "ace/OS.h" to
	  "ace/OS_NS_errno.h". Removing the "big hammer" OS.h stuff. This
	  fixes a compile error in OS_TLI.inl on HP-UX w/ aC++. Why? I
	  have no idea... there's something odd still about orders of
	  includes and/or preprocessor defs or something. This odd compile
	  error creeps up every once in a while and is always related to
	  fudging something somewhere (see fix above for signal...) but
	  this one doesn't have an apparant cause.

	* configure.ac:
	  Moved subdirectory configuration above call to AC_OUTPUT.
	  
	* ace/OS_Memory.h:
	  Provide ACE_nothrow and ACE_nothrow_t definitions for platforms
	  where definitions are not handled by special cases.

	* configure.ac:
	* m4/config_h.m4:
	  Added check for ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW.

        * ace/QoS/qos.mpc:
          Also with bmake set macros += ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2_GQOS

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
          Doxygen improvements/fixes

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Removed commented out lines

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
          Changed to signature for the to_string methods from char to
          ACE_CDR::char so that they match the implementation

	  This is now executed at tao.dre for generating doxygen
	  documentation. The files are then scp'ed to the main website.
