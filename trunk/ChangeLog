        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added more dsps that must be build first

Fri Feb 27 12:33:10 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

	* ace\Event_Handler.cpp (add_reference and remove_reference):

	  Previously, add_reference() and remove_reference() were called
	  on a event handler only if the reference counting policy was
	  enabled.  Unfortunately, this meant that at every place where
	  add_reference() and remove_reference() were called, a check had
	  to be made to see if the reference counting policy was enabled.
	  It also meant that Event_Handler_var class could not be used
	  with event handlers that do not enable the reference counting
	  policy since the Event_Handler_var class was calling
	  add_reference() and remove_reference() without checking the
	  reference counting policy.

	  So I modified the add_reference() and remove_reference() methods
	  so that they check perform the necessary check for the reference
	  counting policy.  This way the Event_Handler_var can be used
	  without concern for whether the event handler has the reference
	  counting policy enabled. Similarly, add_reference() and
	  remove_reference() can also be called without concern for
	  whether the event handler has the reference counting policy
	  enabled.  Only in some places in the ACE library,
	  remove_reference() cannot be called on the event handler because
	  it might have been closed.  Therefore, an explicit check for the
	  reference counting policy still needs to be performed.

	  Reference counting in the following files was made simple
	  because of above change:

	  - ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp
	  - ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp
	  - ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp
	  - ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp

	  The tests/Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp test was
	  extended to check this change.

	  Thanks to Dom Monteiro <d.monteiro@netia.net> and Liat
	  (vliat1@hotmail.com) for pointing out this problem.

          Change the way lines are read so line continuation (ending a line
          in \) would work uniformly within mpb, mpc and mwc files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where 'specific' assignments were always added to
          existing values.  It did not allow for straight assigments or
          subtractions.  Now, specific assigments (additions and
          subtractions) are processed as they are read instead of at the end
          of the project.

Fri Feb 27 11:34:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          When doing a release build with BCB5 also don't use -O2. Thanks
          to Andreas Wagner <awagner@ls-wagner.de> for reporting this. This
          fixes bug [1754].

Fri Feb 27 09:02:07 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
          Fixed definition fsync to fix linker errors in the msvc6
          static builds.

Thu Feb 26 18:08:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Reactor/Client.cpp: Add missing #include
          "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to get ACE_OS::strlen().

Thu Feb 26 18:02:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/tls.m4: Add handling for ACE_TLS_LDFLAGS so user can specify
          linker options (e.g. -L) necessary to find SSL libs.

Thu Feb 26 12:26:28 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Makefile.am (Bug_1576_Regression_Test):

          Added this test to the list of tests.  It was missing.  Thanks
          to Kevin Stacy <kevin_405@yahoo.com> for reporting the problem.

        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp (dynamic_cast_test):

          Corrected spelling in error message.

        * THANKS:

          Added Kevin Stacy to the hall of fame.

Thu Feb 26 10:54:42 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Makefile:

          Removed the CIAO_Core target, since it was brain dead in the
          first place. Thanks to Ed Mulholland for motivating this.

Thu Feb 26 11:15:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AIO_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp: In declaration of
          ACE_Output_Handler, add "using ACE_Service_Handler::open;" before
          declaring the override of it. Helps to disambiguate which open()
          we mean, ACE_Task::open(), or ACE_Service_Handler::open(). Sun
          Forte 8 complained about this ambiguity. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          for reporting this and working on a fix.

Wed Feb 25 13:11:47 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl: Added support for ACE_OS::fsync().
          Thanks to Michel Drapeau <michel.drapeau@asdfsadfh.com> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/codecs.mpb:

          Removed unnecessary macros.  I missed this one in the previous
          commit.

Wed Feb 25 11:28:11 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          If ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME is defined, use nanosleep() in
          ACE_OS::sleep (const ACE_Time_Value &tv) as is used in
          the other version, ACE_OS::sleep (u_int seconds).

        * ace/other.mpb:
        * ace/uuid.mpb:

          Removed unnecessary macros.

Wed Feb 25 12:09:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp: Fixed problems with mismatched
          char/wchar_t usage.

Wed Feb 25 10:43:32 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

          Fixed the portion of the header that determines whether we are
          building on LynxOS 4.0.x or not.  Thanks to Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for reporting this problem and testing my changes on
          LynxOS 3.1.0.

Tue Feb 24 17:31:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Reactor/Client.cpp: Fixed manipulation and iterations_
          count and way that memory is copied into a new ACE_Message_Block.
          Thanks to Karen L. Regner <karen.regner@swri.org> for reporting
          these problems.

        * THANKS: Added Karen Regner to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Feb 24 17:22:45 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.h: Fixed up some of the documentation; clarified
          that the data buffer given to a constructor is not copied anywhere,
          but referenced.

Tue Feb 24 18:57:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.{h,i}:
          Added protected accessor methods cur_size and table. People which
          create a derived class can use these accessors. Thanks to Ganesh Pai
          <GPai@sonusnet.com> for the idea.

Tue Feb 24 07:49:17 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a fill_value() template value called mpc_files which returns
          an array of mpb files and the mpc file that is currently being
          processed.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/HTMLProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a divide by zero error that would arise when there is no
          inheritance at all.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added a new keyword called pure_libs which is similar to lit_libs
          however no file extension is added to the name.  So, it is
          expected that the user will provide the complete library name when
          using pure_libs.

Mon Feb 23 16:57:19 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (write): On Windows with overlapped mode in
          an error condition, need to use ACE_FAIL_RETURN, not naked return,
          to properly set errno to GetLastError.

Mon Feb 23 17:33:04 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added some more project files that must be build first

Mon Feb 23 16:08:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE_export.h:
          When using Cygwin and MinGW GCC version 3.3.1 or later we get dozens
          of warnings about methods that are defined locally after being
          referenced with dllimport. So, when using Cygwin or MinGW, when
          building with inlining enabled, make sure the methods in the ACE_OS
          namespace are marked as inline and not with dllimport. This fixes
          the warnings in the ACE_OS namespace but not the warnings in all
          other places. Thanks to Wu Yongwei <adah@netstd.com> for sending
          a fix for this.

          in many enhancements including an inheritance hierarchy display
          and information from the MPC templates (when used with the -ti
          option).

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

Sat Feb 21 14:24:20 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx_panther.GNU:

          Added -mpcpu=G3 and -mtune=G4 to OCFLAGS. Mac OS X 10.3 requires
          a PowerPC G3 chip and hence this isn't adding any restrictions
          to ACE/TAO that the target platform doesn't already have for
          itself.  Thanks to Thomas Costa <oohrah@mac.com> for the
          patches.

Sat Feb 21 15:14:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Kokyu/tests/EDF/test.cpp:

Sat Feb 21 08:33:55 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DEV_IO.i (recv_n):

          Using ACE::recv_n () created problems on Win32 serial port
          code. Now we call recv_n () on all platform on all platforms but
          Win32. On Win32 we call read_n () which works. Thanks to

          Reverted this change "Fri Feb 20 17:14:46 2004  Irfan Pyarali
          <irfan@oomworks.com>" as I work aout a way to handle
          this.

Fri Feb 20 18:21:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/AC_Client_Logging_Daemon.cpp:
          AC_Input_Handler::close() should accept a u_long, not u_int, to
          properly override ACE_Svc_Handler::close().
          AC_CLD_Connector::connect_svc_handler() first arg is a
          ACE_Svc_Handler*&, not ACE_Svc_Handler*, to properly override
          ACE_Connector::connect_svc_handler().
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for pointing these out.

Fri Feb 20 17:14:46 2004  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@oomworks.com>

        * ace/CDR_Base.{h,cpp} (NonNative LongLong and LongDouble):

          Added assignment operators for these two types.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (read_16):

          The function for reading a longdouble was adjusting and aligning
          the buffer to longlong size rather than to longdouble size.

Fri Feb 20 17:12:14 2004  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@oomworks.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Modified script to run Pluggable and Simple_Two_Stage tests with
          SCTP_SEQ transport protocol only when the SCTP config flag is
          set.

          Removed these static msvc6 project files. Use MPC to generate these
          if you need them. These are outdated and should have gone before 1.4
          was released.

Fri Feb 20 18:47:26 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added FaultTolerance.dsp, RTCosScheduling and FtRtEvent.dsp to this

          static builds.

Fri Feb 20 16:40:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Fri Feb 20 07:51:04 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * etc/ace.doxygen:

          Reverted the change "Sun Dec 28 15:09:34 UTC 2003  Don Hinton
          <dhinton@dresystems.com>" since it broke stuff in
          ACE-categories.html. Don seems to have a better fix. Till
          then. This reversal will create problems for folks who untar
          doxygen documentation on platfroms where the path length could
          be an issue.

Thu Feb 19 15:22:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Template_Instantiations.cpp: Add a block to keep HP aC++ from
          issuing a warning about an empty translation unit.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h: Added #include "ace/config-lite.h" because
          this file checks on config options.

        * ace/config-all.h: No need to include "ace/Global_Macros.h" from here.

        * ace/MEM_Addr.cpp (same_host): To account for IPv4/IPv6 differences,
          use ACE_INET_Addr::operator==. Because that method takes the port
          number into account when comparing, and we don't care about the
          port number, copy the two addresses to new ACE_INET_Addr objects
          and set their port numbers to 0, then compare.

        * tests/Multicast_Test_IPV6.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp: Corrected name of log file so
          the test script can find it.

Thu Feb 19 08:06:09 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (lstat): Removed the ACE_WIN32
          branch since Windows doesn't support _lstat().  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for this.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Added ACE_LACKS_LSTAT.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for this.

Thu Feb 19 11:40:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Make all of the error and diagnostic messages go through the

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made inheritance hierarchy information available to the project
          creator subclasses.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Increment the version number.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a problem with the implict inter-project dependency
          generation code.  It now looks at indirect project dependency to
          avoid adding inter-project dependencies when they are not needed.
          This fixes [BUGID 1653].

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Added a missing <%endif%>.

Wed Feb 18 10:41:07 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl: Removed an extra endif. Thanks to Don
          Hinton for sending the patch.

Wed Feb 18 07:04:55 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.{h,inl}: Changed the first parameter of
          lstat() to be ACE_TCHAR rather than just char and revised the
          #defines so things should work better on Windows.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp (dirent_count): Rearranged some
          code so the test would work.  Thanks to Zvika Ashani
          <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for reporting this and testing it.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Changed S_IFLNK to 0200000.
          Thanks to Zvika Ashani <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for reporting
          this and testing it.

Tue Feb 17 19:55:56 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector.cpp:
          Add #include <ace/OS_NS_string.h> to get ACE_OS::memcpy().

Tue Feb 17 10:29:34 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC6ProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added an environment variable,
          MPC_DEPENDENCY_COMBINED_STATIC_LIBRARY, to control the creation of
          inter-project dependencies of static libraries for the em3, vc6,
          vc7 and vc71 project types.  If the environment variable is set,
          MPC will generate inter-project dependencies for static libraries.
          Whereas, normally it would not.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VA4ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed a redundent version of the translate_value() method.

Mon Feb 16 08:06:23 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Changed the value of S_IFLNK so
          that it's different than S_IFREG.  Thanks to Zvika Ashani
          <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for reporting this.

Mon Feb 16 13:40:34 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/openssl.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qos.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/zlib.mpb:

          Added bmake to the specific sections for these base projects.

Sun Feb 15 16:34:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h:

          Fixed a typo that was causing compile errors on Win32.

Sun Feb 15 09:40:46 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_stat.h: Added a #define for
          S_IFLNK for Windows platforms, which lack this #define.  Thanks
          to Zvika Ashani for reporting this.

Sun Feb 15 10:00:58 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:

          Fixed unused function warnings.

Sat Feb 14 11:41:27 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl: Implement lstat() so that it'll
          use stat() on platforms that don't support lstat().

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp: Updated this test so it will
          illustrate how to recurse through a hierarchical directory
          structure.  Thanks to Zvika Ashani <zvika@aspectusvi.com> for
          helping to motivate this example and for providing the initial
          implementation.

Sat Feb 14 09:22:25 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/Makefile:
        * ace/TMCast/TMCast.mpc:

          Needs threads=1 to compile.

Sat Feb 14 08:48:10 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/TMCast/Group.cpp:

          Fixed compile errors in daily builds.

Fri Feb 13 12:21:06 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait): If the
          ACE_Event_Handler::handle_exit() methods kills a managed
          process, the process_table_ array is modified before
          this->remove_proc (idx) is called. In this case the value of idx
          is wrong, so we replace remove_proc(idx) with remove(pid).
          Thanks to Carsten Prescher <carsten.prescher@sysde.eads.net> for
          reporting this.  This fixes bugid 1743.

Fri Feb 13 09:47:25 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (clone_from):

          The check that is done before we go for an allocation needs to
          include the CDR alignment.

        * ace/TMCast/Group.cpp:

          Use standard macros like ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX that can compile in
          single-threaded and multi-threaded builds. Thanks to Duane
          Binder for providing the patches.

Fri Feb 13 10:50:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Timers/Task.cpp: In main(), interval should be
          initialized with 100000 usecs, not 1000, to be .1 sec as the
          comment indicates. Thanks to Norm Whitehead
          <Norm_Whitehead@raytheon.com> for reporting this.

        * THANKS: Added Norm Whitehead to the Hall of Fame.

Thu Feb 12 10:40:40 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ACE-categories.html:

          Fixed the url location. But the file names will not work since
          we have broken the  name generation in doxygen. We will fix that
          next.

Thu Feb 12 09:34:37 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/depgen.pl:

          Added the ACE_PLATFORM_CONFIG environment variable to the
          replacement list.  I'm not sure why this is desirable, but g++dep
          does it so now depgen.pl does it.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyEditor.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/DependencyGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUDependencyWriter.pm:

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/NMakeObjectGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/ObjectGenerator.pm:
        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Made many optimizations to compensate for the additional
          replacement variable.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/fault_tolerance.mpb:

          The fault_tolerance base project needs the ftorb base project.

Wed Feb 11 16:25:11 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (get_host_addr): On Windows for IPv6, don't try
          to call ACE_OS::inet_ntop() - it's not supported. The rough
          equivalent is getnameinfo(). Rather than add this at the ACE_OS
          layer after BFO (getnameinfo() may have been replaced by newer
          APIs in other OSes) add the getnameinfo() call in here.
          This fixes the crash in INET_Addr_Test on Windows w/ IPv6.

Wed Feb 11 13:14:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/INET_Addr_Test_IPV6.cpp: Cast INADDR_ANY to ACE_UINT32 to
          disambiguate it from a 0 char*. Fixes compile error on Windows.

Wed Feb 11 15:39:29 GMT 2004  Paul Morrison  <epm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigAction.cpp

          Added a reinterpret_cast to fix a build error with LynxOS.

Wed Feb 11 15:31:06 GMT 2004  Paul Morrison  <epm@prismtechnologies.com>

        * TAO/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Basic_Logging_Service/Makefile
        * TAO/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Event_Logging_Service/Makefile
        * TAO/orbsvcs/Logging_Service/Notify_Logging_Service/Makefile
        * TAO/orbsvcs/examples/Log/RTEvent/Makefile

          Added -lTAO_Svc_Utils to LDLIBS line to remove link errors with
          LynxOS build.

Wed Feb 11 07:36:16 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.rel:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Added the ability to use wildcards in the default.rel file.  For
          example, *_ROOT is now used to pick up all environment variables
          that end in _ROOT.

Tue Feb 10 13:32:51 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Proactor/HA_Proactive_Status.cpp: Add ACE_TEXT
          around string literal and make the "need async I/O" message
          more explicit.

Tue Feb 10 11:27:59 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/bison.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/flex.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/lex.mpb:

          Added base projects with custom definitions for bison, flex and
          lex.  Currently, yacc can't be supported since the output file
          can't be explicitly specified.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the line number to an informational message.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed this template to allow source files to exist within
          sub-directories, but have the object files go in the build
          directory.

Tue Feb 10 15:51:50 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Even if the user overrides PLATFORM_SCTP_CPPFLAGS in
          platform_macros.GNU, either ACE_HAS_OPENSS7_SCTP or
          ACE_HAS_LKSCTP *must* be added to PLATFORM_SCTP_CPPFLAGS, otherwise
          wrong code will get compiled.  Also, for sctp=lksctp, do
          not hardcode PLATFORM_SCTP_LIBS to /usr/local/lib/libsctp.a.
`         Instead set PLATFORM_SCTP_LDFLAGS to -L/usr/local/lib
          and set PLATFORM_SCTP_LIBS to -lsctp.

Tue Feb 10 08:45:10 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in the template where no binary targets would be built
          if there are no libraries linked in.

Tue Feb 10 07:29:55 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.h:

          #included ace/os_include/os_errno.h. Needed for builds where
          ACE_HAS_SIGNAL_SAFE_OS_CALLS is defined. Thanks to Kobi
          Cohen-Arazi for the patch.

Mon Feb  9 18:21:41 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/Naming/Name_Binding.h: The Name_Binding destructor
          should use ACE_OS::free(), not delete[], to release type_. It
          was allocated using ACE_OS::strdup().

Mon Feb  9 16:10:07 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp: ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool::commit_backing_store_name()
          and ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool::handle_signal() ACE_ERROR_RETURN
          macros were returning the wrong value (0 instead of -1).  Thanks
          to Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobi-co@barak-online.net> for reporting
          this problem.

Mon Feb  9 13:58:30 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/GNUObjectGenerator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where cpp files in subdirectories would have the wrong
          target name generated in the dependencies.

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          Removed an unnecessary directory in the include search path.

Mon Feb  9 10:31:40 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DependencyGenerator/Preprocessor.pm:

          If the file for which dependencies are being generated contains a
          directory name, then we need to look for include files in that
          directory.

Mon Feb  9 07:00:05 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Added the custom generated files to the realclean target.

Sun Feb  8 15:36:30 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Just added the 1,800th contributor to the THANKS file!!

Sun Feb  8 15:34:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Also generate a realclean target for the IDL files so that IDL
          generated files are removed when running a realclean.

Sun Feb  8 14:25:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:
          Added first version support of using the Cygwin compiler within
          the CBuilderX Development Environment

Sun Feb  8 14:02:53 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:
          Added MinGW support for in the CBuilderX IDE

Sun Feb  8 13:06:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:
          Improved the CBuilderX template. Don't compile template files and
          disabled some warnings.

Sat Feb  7 19:33:56 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/RMCast/Send_File/Sender.cpp (ACE_TMAIN):
          Fixed a typo in the comments.  Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi>
          for the patch.

Fri Feb  6 15:49:37 2004  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:

          Added TAO_ROOT/tao and CIAO_ROOT/ciao to the include
          paths (C++ and (C)IDL). These additions allow users
          to include <orb.idl> or <Components.idl> without
          being concerned about the specific directory they
          reside in.

Fri Feb  6 14:53:27 2004  Tao Lu  <lu@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          Added a new feature cidl into the global features.
          This feature is turned off by default, so no makefiles
          or project files will be gnerated for CCF and CIDLC.

Fri Feb  6 14:13:25 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl (msec): Changed the return type of
          ACE_Time_Value::msec() from long to unsigned long to prevent
          problems with wrap-arounds that yield negative numbers.  Thanks
          to Matthew Gillen <gillen@ohio.edu> for this fix.

Fri Feb  6 11:50:36 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:

          Fixes a problem that this change "Thu Jan 15 08:02:23 2004
          Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>" opened up and which
          Craig Rodrigues reported. This problem has been lying around for
          almost an year now. In the static method
          get_port_number_from_name (), if we get a portnumber 0
          (perfectly valid to send a 0) we missed to check for port
          0. This has now been fixed. Thanks to Craig for reporting this.

Fri Feb  6 09:48:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):

          Reverted the change "Fri Feb  6 09:31:30 2004  Balachandran
          Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" since it creates more
          problems.

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:

          Added ACE_LACKS_SWAB. This is a lie. There are signatures
          mismatch and adding compile time options that get the right
          signatures messes things up a lot. Someone needs to take a look
          at it fix the compile time options properly.

Fri Feb  6 09:35:13 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventlogadmin.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from dslogadmin and rtoldevent instead of
          dseventlogadmin.

Fri Feb  6 09:31:30 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU (CPPFLAGS):

          Added -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED=1 to
          CPPFLAGS. This should fix the compile errors in Solaris builds.

Fri Feb  6 09:04:50 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Added support for dynamicflags, staticflags and rc files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added the _REENTRANT macro to the extracppflags for many of the
          platforms.

Fri Feb  6 06:35:32 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Updated the usage to reflect the new Cbx workspace type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/CbxWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MWC.pm:

          Added the workspace counterpart to the CbxProjectCreator.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for providing me an example workspace.

Fri Feb  6 11:48:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Fixed typo in this file which caused build problems when .rc are
          used (Cygwin and MinGW do this).

Thu Feb  5 13:38:15 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bmake.mpd:

          Added rules for all of the MPC supported C++ file extensions.

Thu Feb  5 11:25:50 2004  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Modified build rules to allow projects with sources in sub-
          directoris. Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
          for his help.

Thu Feb  5 08:48:27 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.{h,cpp}: added a new methods called
          testterminate() which checks to see whether a thread has
          terminated or not.  Thanks to Avi Ouziel <ouziel_a@hotmail.com>
          for this suggestion.

Thu Feb  5 07:55:10 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where Borland projects generated on UNIX would not
          reflect the correct cppdir value.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Sort the projects names so projects are easier to find in large
          lists.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Driver.pm:

          Fixed a bug in the usage output.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Updated the MPC version number.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/USAGE:

          Updated the usage to reflect the new alternative Borland Make
          project type.

          Added a new alternative Borland Make project type called bmake.
          It does not rely on any of the .bor files in
          ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude.

          Moved the prototypes for getopt() and putenv() out of

Wed Feb  4 18:15:16 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU: Allow
          user to override SCTP flags in platform_macros.GNU
          before including platform_linux.GNU.

Wed Feb  4 17:41:25 UTC 2004  Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_freebsd.GNU:
          Change thread flags to reflect new changes in FreeBSD.
          KSE-based -lpthread is now the default library in
          FreeBSD-CURRENT.

Tue Feb  3 16:21:49 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4: If --disable-rtti is specified on AIX, add
          -DACE_LACKS_RTTI to CXXFLAGS.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Makefile.am:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile.am: Removed the
          extraneous path prefix for the required same-directory libraries in
          main_LDADD to allow the Makefile to see the library and build it
          first at make time.

Tue Feb  3 07:37:20 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          order to access the platforms.

Mon Feb  2 13:53:08 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/OutputMessage.pm:

          Added an interface for printing informational, warning and error
          messages.  This allows messages to be manipulated prior to being
          printed.  Informational messages are off by default and can be
          enabled by setting the MPC_INFORMATION environment variable.  The
          informational and warning messages can be turned off by setting the
          MPC_SILENT environment variable.

Mon Feb  2 13:48:23 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:

          Move the location of the custom build rules to ensure that they
          are added to the all target before the object files.  This ensures
          that the custom build rules are processed before source files are
          compiled.

Mon Feb 02 10:00:29 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-6.h:

          Looks like VC6 has a non-const swab.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Fixed the non-const part of the swab () to compile with vc6.

Mon Feb  2 08:18:41 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/CbxProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed an unused implementation of the fill_value() method.

          Removed the ssl and defaultlibs keyword.  These were unncessary
          and should have been removed long ago.

Mon Feb  2 07:16:42 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Changed the parameters to void * instead of char * since most of
          the platforms take a void *.

Mon Feb  2 06:56:32 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.ace:

          Building applications which use ACE library fail because
          LynxOS's linker is unable to find dlopen() which is used in
          DLL_Manager.o and implemented in OS_NS_dlfcn.o.

          To fix this, OS_NS_dlfcn.o must be placed after DLL_Manager.o
          when creating libACE.a with ar. Thanks to Olli Savia for the
          patch.

        * ace/README:
          Some platforms have a swab function where the first argument is
          non const, added ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SWAB which then must be set.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_NONCONST_SWAB

Sun Feb  1 15:15:44 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Added missing libraries that are needed when linking with fltk
          support.

Sun Feb  1 12:36:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/build_lib.bor:
          Added support for using the CBX ar with the -M commandline option
          to pass it a script. This fixes the too long commandline.

Sat Jan 31 11:01:33 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Thanks to Olli Savia, we now have a ACE_OS::swab (). This calls
          the platform specific swab () function. There is a emulation
          which could be used on platforms that don't support ::swab
          (). The emulation can be used by defining ACE_LACKS_SWAB.

          I haven't added ACE_LACKS_SWAB in any config file. We will do it
          as and when things showup in our daily builds.

Sat Jan 31 08:52:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/smart_proxies.mpb:

          any of the cpp files.

Fri Jan 30 09:02:30 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp (proactor_run_event_loop): Make sure to
          return if the handle_events() call return 0, which indicates
          a timeout.  Thanks to Daniel Buchs <acelib@dbux.ch> for
          this fix.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MWC.pm:
        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Pulled the creator lists out of the perl scripts and moved them
          into the new MPC and MWC modules.  This will allow the extension
          of MPC by providing a way to hook new workspace and project types
          into MPC without adding anything to the MPC repository.

Thu Jan 29 14:10:51 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the workspace output to allow a user to make a specific
          target within the workspace.  If the user specified target
          requires other projects, then those projects are built also.  For
          example, a user could execute "nmake CosNaming" using the Makefile
          generated from the TAOACE.mwc file and the CosNaming library
          would be built including everything else that was required to
          build that library.

          Removed IDL_Files as a built-in build type and replaced it as a
          custom build type.  The syntax of IDL_Files has only changed in
          that idlgendir is no longer a usable keyword.  gendir should be
          used in its place.  Additionally, the custom build rules can not
          be executed in parallel when using the GNUACE project type.  This
          does not stop multiple unrelated projects from being built in
          parallel.  In order to get the IDL custom build type, your project
          must inherit, either directly or indirectly, from taoidldefaults.
          The amh, ciao_client, taoexe and taolib_with_idl base projects all
          inherit from taoidldefaults.  Others get it indirectly.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/idl_compiler.mpt:

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added custom build output inference that takes gendir settings
          into account.  If a custom build file is listed, gendir is set and
          the generated source isn't listed in the Source_Files list, then
          the correct generated source files will be listed with the correct
          path determined by gendir.

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Moved os_math.h include from config-cygwin32.h to ACE.h. When
          ACE_NTRACE is set we got include problems. Cygwin defines log2
          as macro and we have ACE::log2. The include of os_math.h is only

        * include/makeinclude/clean.bor:
          Changed this file a little, special independent clean fules for cbx
          and other versions and dependent on the version used the right clean
          rule is used.

        * include/makeinclude/clean.bor:
          The CBuilderX Preview compiler uses the .o extension for object
          files, all other Borland versions use .obj. Some time ago I
          introduced $(OBJ_EXT) to handle this, but this was not complete
          yet. Change the makefile instructure to handle $(OBJ_EXT) instead
          of obj and changed the MPC Borland template to generate $(OBJ_EXT)
          instead of obj. This way everything works as normally, but when
          you use the new CBuilderX Preview environment you must regenerate
          your makefiles using MPC.

Mon Jan 26 09:35:51 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          When calling the prelink script, the object files should be in
          double quotes.

        * ace/config-all.h:
          Moved the ACE_TRACE defines from Global_Macros.h to config-all.
          and ACE_OS_TRACE from config-lite.h to config-all.h, and added
          ACE_OS_NTRACE to config-all.h with the same symantics.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for motivating this
          change.

        * examples/ASX/Event_Server/Event_Server/Options.cpp:
        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/Options.cpp:
          Added #include OS_NS_strings.h if ACE_HAS_TRACE is defined.

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          Some cosmetic fixes to get ACEXEML and Kokyu compiled well
          before other things. The dsw's in TAO hierarchy do not have the
          dsp's of ACE hierarchy included but for TAOACE.dsw.

Sun Jan 25 08:59:40 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Kokyu/Kokyu.mwc:
        * ACEXML/ACEXML.mwc:

          Added new workspace files. The above pieces should be compilable
          without going into TAO and using TAOACE.mwc.

Sun Jan 25 12:26:19 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Auto_IncDec_Test.cpp:
          Extended debug info with the total number of threads. This then shows
          that with Cygwin threads that exit are not removed from the
          thread manager

Sun Jan 25 11:34:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:
          Cleaned up some old stuff

Sat Jan 24 16:11:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:
          With CBuilderX Preview putenv, wcstod, wcstol and wcstoul are in the
          std namespace, so added ACE_STD_NAMESPACE which expands to std with
          Borland, to nothing with other compilers.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:
          The vswprintf for Dinkum STL is different. CBuilderX Preview has
          std::tempnam, so added checking for borland version.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp:
          vswprintf and vsnprintf are different with CBuilderX Preview

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:

Fri Jan 23 14:04:31 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the defaulting rules for implicitly adding source files
          when IDL_Files (or any other custom type) is specified.
          Previously, generated source files would only be added to the
          Source_Files section only if IDL_Files was not specified and no
          generated source files were already listed in Source_Files.  Now,
          the generated source files will be added whether or not IDL_Files
          is specified and no generated source files were already listed in
          Source_Files.

Fri Jan 23 19:09:43 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_string.cpp:
          With CBuilderX Preview strdup is in the std namespace, so
          added ACE_STD_NAMESPACE which expands to std with Borland,
          to nothing with other compilers.

Fri Jan 23 10:04:00 2004  Gary Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com>

        Fix for BUGID 1722, for Tandem NSK platform.
        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:

          Need to use spt_system() instead of system().

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_wait.inl:

          Need to use spt_waitpid() instead of waitpid()

Fri Jan 23 10:30:12 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/create_ace_build.pl:

          Exclude .exp files and ensure that we can stat() the real file
          before checking the modification time in
          backup_and_copy_changed().

Fri Jan 23 09:41:11 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Reverted my change from Tue Jan 20 14:11:48 2004.  While the
          generated vcproj loads properly, the project does not link
          properly.

Fri Jan 23 15:04:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:

          compiler

Fri Jan 23 10:47:54 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Another set of changes for CBuilderX. strcasecmp and strncasecmp
          should come from the std namespace

Fri Jan 23 10:04:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          ACE_STRCASECMP_EQUIVALENT and ACE_STRNCASECMP_EQUIVALENT are not
          needed anymore for the CBuilderX Preview compiler

Fri Jan 23 09:42:15 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:
          Dinkum STL doesn't have tzset. Fixes another compile problem with
          the new Borland CBuilderX Preview compiler

Fri Jan 23 09:36:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
          CBuilderX Preview defines _MSC_VER and __BORLANDC__ so only use
          _CrtSetReportMode when _MSC_VER is defined and not __BORLANDC__.
          Borland isn't making thing easier to maintain.

Fri Jan 23 09:30:45 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-borland-common.h:
          CBuilderX Preview has _endthreadex in the std namespace

Fri Jan 23 09:23:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          CBuilderX seems to lack win32 structural exceptions

Fri Jan 23 08:41:53 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_time.h:
          Dinkum STL doesn't have timezone or _timezone so only try to use
          timezone when we don't have Dinkum STL.

Fri Jan 23 07:38:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/README:
        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:
          Added ace_timezone implementation for use with Dinkum STL, which
          lacks _timezone. For this added ACE_HAS_DINKUM_STL which can be
          set when using the Dinkum STL version.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          The new CBuilderX preview compiler uses Dinkum STL, so se then
          ACE_HAS_DINKUM_STL

Thu Jan 22 19:57:59 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.am (install-data-local):

          Fixed problem that occurred when performing a "make install".
          The "os_include" source and installation directories were not
          properly referenced.

        * ace/os_include/os_pthread.h

          Fix for BUGID 1707

          Added #ifdef so correct pthreads include file is used when
          compiling for Tandem NSK platform.

Thu Jan 22 17:48:56 2004  Gary Maxey <gary.maxey@hp.com>

          Added missing #endif to end of file

Thu Jan 22 19:08:56 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_stat.inl (mkdir):

          ACE_OS::mkdir for OS PSOS wrote one character behind allocated
          memory. Fixed it by adding an extra byte for allocation. Thanks
          to Dieter Knueppel <dknueppel@datus.com> for reporting the
          problem and suggesting a fix.

Thu Jan 22 19:00:50 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h:

          This patch fixes redeclaration of pthread_sigmask
          function which showe up RH 9 systems with glibc
          2.3. pthread_sigmask declaration is now protected by a guard
          which will be defined in the platform configuration file. Thanks
          to Olli Savia for providing the patch.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          A fix similar to this fix "Wed Jan 21 13:38:11 UTC 2004  Johnny
          Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>", but added
          ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SIGMASK_PROTO within the block for glib 2.3.

Thu Jan 22 19:02:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/Task_ThreadPool.cpp: Use 0, not NULL, to
          initialize a pointer.

Thu Jan 22 18:08:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/APG/ThreadPools/ThreadPool.cpp: Don't ACE_ASSERT action
          that needs to be performed regardless of the ACE_NDEBUG setting.

Thu Jan 22 13:25:49 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.7.h:

          Define ACE_LACKS_GETLOADAVG in config-sunos5.5.h since SunOS 5.5
          and 5.6 do not have getloadavg().  Undefine it in
          config-sunos5.7.h, since it has it.

Wed Jan 22 10:33:47 2004  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/wxwindows.mpb
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          Fixed wxwindows base project in support
          of $TAO_ROOT/util/wxNamingViewer.
          wxwindows project now require wxWindows defined
          (in plaform_macros.GNU) as was since 12/1/00
          instead of wxwindows. I choose historical precidence
          over making the macro and project name both
          being all lower case.

          Note: The wxNamingViewer Makefile was overriding the
          PLATFORM_WX_* macros defined in platform_*.GNU so I updated the
          macros in platform_*.GNU to be like the overrides in the Makefile.
          These macros are based on the wxWindows configuration.
          The wxNamingViewer makefile contains the only use of these
          macros.

          Only tested on RedHat 9 with wx_gtk 2.4.2.

          Note - the platform_*.GNU files definition of PLATFORM_WX_*
                 only support wxWindows over GTK+.
          TBD - support wxWindows MSVC and Borland in wxwindows.mpc.

          Added "netsvcs" directory to the list of subdirectories to
          recurse.

        * netsvcs/Makefile.am:

          Reverted a series of changes that somehow left this file in an
          inconsistent state in our CVS repository, and unparsable by
          Automake.  In particular, it incorrectly contained
          Borland-specific Makefile code.

          Updated to our latest Makefile.am conventions.

        * tests/Makefile.am:

          Added more missing header files to appropriate source file
          lists.  Missing files were made evident when running a "make
          distcheck".

Wed Jan 21 20:12:38 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (ACE_CONFIG_COMMANDS):

          Include ACE version in configuration completion message to
          improve clarity.

Wed Jan 21 20:17:34 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue.i: Fixed ACE_Message_Queue_NT::is_empty()
          so that it returns the right result.  Thanks to Ariel Peltz
          <Arielp@bigbandnet.com> for contributing this fix.

Wed Jan 21 13:28:41 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac:

          Do not rely on "ace/OS.cpp" when performing test that determines
          if the generated configuration is usable.  "ace/OS.cpp" has been
          superseded by and split off into several other files.  Addresses
          bogus ACE usability configure script errors when running a "make
          distcheck".

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Added missing "-version-number" libtool flag for all subset
          libraries.  Fixes problem where the library version for all
          these libraries was "0.0.0".  Thanks to Robert Schiele
          <robert.schiele@t-online.de> for discovering the problem and for
          providing a fix.

          (libACE_Utils_la_SOURCES):

          Added Template_Instantiations.cpp file to this source list.
          Fixes a "missing file" problem revealed by a "distcheck".

          (HEADER_FILES, INLINE_FILES, TEMPLATE_FILES):

          Updated these source file lists.  Addresses "missing file"
          problems exhibited when performing a "make distcheck".

        * m4/acinclude.m4 (ACE_USE_TEMP_FILE):

          Fixed problem that prevented the "distcheck" target from passing
          due to an attempt to write a file into a read-only directory.

        * tests/Makefile.am (Multihomed_INET_Addr_Test_SOURCES):

          Removed "Multihomed_INET_Addr_Test.h" from this source file
          list.  That file doesn't exist.  Detected when performing a
          "make distcheck".

          (libService_Config_DLL_la_SOURCES, libTest_Output_la_SOURCES):

          Added missing Service_Config_DLL_Export.h and
          Test_Output_Export.h file to these test's source lists,
          respectively.  Addresses problem revealed by a "distcheck".

          (lib_LTLIBRARIES)

          Added missing Framework_Component_DLL library to the list of
          libraries to build.

Wed Jan 21 13:37:20 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          Added gperf to the list of workspaces that needs compilation
          upfront as part of core.

Wed Jan 21 13:38:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          glibc version 2.3 defines the method isastream, so from this
          glibc version don't do this anymore in the ACE library by
          setting then the define ACE_HAS_ISASTREAM_PROTO. On RH9 defining
          the isastream method within ACE caused errors because there this
          method has an exception specification. This only appeared when
          other libraries are used which include stropts.h themselves.
          Also on SuSE 9 with glibc v2.3 I see that isastream has an
          exception specification. This fixed [BUGID 1613].  Thanks to
          Jeffrey Graham <jgraham@titan.com> and Akim Boyko
          <akim@sitech.com.ua> for reporting this.

Wed Jan 21 12:58:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Removed the setting of MWMO_ALERTABLE when using MinGW. This is
          set already by MinGW a long time.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:
        * ace/README:
          MinGW delivers a dirent.h which has opendir, closedir, readdir,
          etc. Because in the OS_NS_dirent files always on win32 is assumed
          that we haven't these methods, introduces ACE_LACKS_OPENDIR,
          ACE_LACKS_CLOSEDIR and ACE_LACKS_READDIR. These defines are set
          in config-win32-common and undef'd in config-win32-mingw.h.
          So, on MinGW we use the normal opendir/closedir/readdir, the other
          environmens in win32 use the corresponding emulation methods. This
          fixes [BUGID 1718]. Thanks to Matthew Grosso <mgrosso@acm.org>
          for reporting this and supplying the patches.

Tue Jan 20 19:58:03 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac:

          Replaced all uses of the "changequote" M4 built-in with proper
          quoting.  Use of "changequote" is very discouraged by autoconf
          developers since it is often a source of M4 programming
          problems.

          (ACE_VERSION, AC_INIT):

          Statically determine the version of ACE using M4 built-ins at
          autoconf-time, instead of dynamically setting the ACE version in
          a shell variable at configure-time.  This allows the package
          version to be set in the autoconf AC_INIT call since AC_INIT
          expects a static value.

          Replaced "TEST-VERSION" version value passed to AC_INIT call
          with new ACE_VERSION macro.  This allows the correct package
          version, e.g. "5.4" instead of "TEST-VERSION", to be propagated
          to a number of places within the configure script itself, and
          Makefile.in templates generated by Automake.  For example,
          "configure --help" and "configure --version" now display the
          correct version of ACE.

          (ACE_CURRENT, ACE_AGE, ACE_REVISION):

          Removed all kludges that worked around libtool's versioning
          scheme.  Libtool 1.5 or better now provides a means to set a
          package defined library version.  Thanks to Robert Schiele
          <robert.schiele@t-online.de> pointing out the new libtool
          feature.

        * bin/bootstrap:

          Cleaned up obsolete comments and commented code.

          Force auxiliary files to be copied to prevent older versions
          from being used with newer versions autotools that expect newer
          versions of the auxiliary files.

          Clarified some progress messages so that it is obvious that
          bootstrapping corresponds to ACE autotool support.

        * m4/ace.m4:
        * m4/acinclude.m4:
        * m4/compiler.m4:
        * m4/platform.m4:

          Replaced all uses of the "changequote" M4 built-in with proper
          quoting.  Use of "changequote" is very discouraged by autoconf
          developers since it is often a source of M4 programming
          problems.

        * ace/Makefile.am (libACE_la_LDFLAGS):

          Use new libtool 1.5 "-version-number" option instead of
          "-version-info" to override libtool's versioning scheme with
          ACE's versioning scheme.  Thanks to Robert Schiele
          <robert.schiele@t-online.de> pointing out the new libtool
          feature.

        * ace/RMCast/Makefile.am (libACE_RMCast_la_LDFLAGS):
        * ace/SSL/Makefile.am (libACE_SSL_la_LDFLAGS):

          Set ACE_RMCast and ACE_SSL library versions to ACE library
          version, instead of not setting at all (defaulting to 0.0.0).
          This is consistent with our stock/classical ACE build
          Makefiles.

Tue Jan 20 16:57:54 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Active_Map_Manager.i:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:

          Fixed warnings in VC71 builds. Thanks to Grutzmacher
          Lukas<gruetzmacher@ais-dresden.de> for reporting the problem and
          providing patches.

Tue Jan 20 15:37:18 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          Fixed some typos in the comments.

Mon Jan 19 18:49:50 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

          This is a new auto_compile script for MSVC with MPC. This just
          build DLL's for both debug and release versions. The old file
          msvc_auto_compile.pl is age old and suffers from severe brain
          hemorrage which is hard to rectify with simple band aids and
          stuff. The old file simply needs to go. This new script will be
          used completely for DLL builds after testing in our daily
          builds.

Tue Jan 20 14:11:48 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added support for file grouping in these templates.  If source
          files are grouped in the mpc file, they will show up grouped in
          the graphical interfaces for these project types.

Tue Jan 20 12:20:35 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the all target wouldn't be generated if the
          platform is capable of shared libraries but the user only wants
          static libraries.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Rearranged some of the VxWorks related settings.

Tue Jan 20 18:02:19 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Made some small corrections.

Tue Jan 20 17:05:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          When using BCB6 and release builds we get errors about __strcmp__ is
          undefined. This is caused by the optimizer of BCB6 which generates
          code for common functions like strcpy() within the calling function's
          scope. The compiler flag is -Oi and this is set when the complete -O2
          optimization options is passed. So, with BCB6 in release builds,
          we don't set -O2, but set all specific optimization flags but just not
          -Oi. This is the only way I could fix this.

Tue Jan 20 16:00:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Added support for the Cygwin 1.5.6-1 version

Mon Jan 19 13:31:46 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Makefile: In AUTOCONF_RELEASE_FILES, changed aux to aux_config to
          match: Fri Jan 16 12:29:48 2004  Ossama Othman.

Mon Jan 19 17:27:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release:
          Dfm files shouldn't get LF->CRLF conversions. Thanks to

Mon Jan 19 10:46:51 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GUID.pm:

          Mask the 4 byte portions of the GUID with 0xffffffff to avoid
          problems with 64-bit versions of Cygwin Perl.  Thanks to Cristian
          Ferretti <cristian_ferretti@yahoo.com> for reporting this and
          providing a fix.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/make.mpd:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added support for VxWorks 5.5 PPC and PENTIUM.

Mon Jan 19 15:59:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Tests.bor:
          Added missing FIFO_Test. Thanks to Peter Bekiesch

Mon Jan 19 08:07:02 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where files added to the Template_Files section were
          not removed from the Source_Files section due to differences in
          slashes to backslashes.

Mon Jan 19 07:24:16 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Misc/test_XtReactor1.cpp:
        * examples/Misc/test_XtReactor2.cpp:

          Removed #define for String (added back in '96).  The workaround is
          apparently no longer needed.  Also fixed some build errors and
          warnings.

Mon Jan 19 10:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

Sun Jan 18 15:32:59 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Added patches from Viktor Ransmayr<viktor.ransmayr@t-online.de>
          for a documentation patch, which describes how to build ACE
          using only the MinGW and MSYS package.

Sun Jan 18 10:27:11 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/RT_CORBA_Leader_Follower.cpp:

          Used ACE_UINT64_DBLCAST_ADAPTER  instead of direct casting to a
          double to be more portable.

          #included fstream conditionally on VC6. This should fix the
          remaining compile errors on VC6 with MPC builds.

Sun Jan 18 09:48:03 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/TMCast/member.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation errors with VC6 which stemmed due to the
          fact that a unsigned long long was used. We use ACE_UINT64
          instead.

Sun Jan 18 09:40:04 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:
          Added tests/Test_Output.dsp to the list of libs to be build first
          when building statically. Removed the code for the non-MPC static
          build, the projects for this are removed before the 1.4 release.

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added tests/Test_Output.dsp to the list of libs to be build first.

Sun Jan 18 08:52:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Sat Jan 17 19:19:33 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/ASNMP_Export.h:

          Added missing ASNMP_Export macro.

          This fixes several build problems on Win32. Thanks to
          Michelangelo Nottoli <m.nottoli@acsys.it> for reporting this
          and supplying the ideas how to fix this.

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:
        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          When using static projects we cannot use the dependencies between
          different libraries. Therefor we have to explicitly define the
          build order. The existing msvc_auto_compile.pl script was getting
          to complex, so added a new msvc_static_compile.pl script that will
          be used for building statically. In the msvc_static_order.lst the
          order of building can be specified.

Sat Jan 17 09:46:38 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          The fix for the ec_typed_events feature. Thanks to Chad Elliot for
          explaining that MPC inheritance is based on file name. So CosEvent.mpc
          inherits from ec_typed_events in the orbsvcs directory, projects using
          event inherit from event which inherits from ec_use_typed_events
          which then sets the needed compiler flags and adds the needed
          libraries to the linker.

Fri Jan 16 15:04:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp (close): Set the this->if_list_
          field to 0 to let applications close and re-open the socket.
          Without it, a second close will delete already delete'd memory.
          Thanks to Shannon Barber <shannon.barber@myrealbox.com> for
          this fix.

Fri Jan 16 12:29:48 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR):

          Changed auxiliary directory filename from "aux" to
          "aux_config".  The former is not an allowed/valid name on
          Windows.  Thanks to Greg Mulyar <greg_mu@yahoo.com> for pointing
          out the problem.

Fri Jan 16 14:19:14 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Fixed the project names in MPC to be similar to the ones used in
          default distribution. Thanks to Boris Kaminer
          <boris_kaminer@mail.ru> for motivating this fix.

Fri Jan 16 16:09:31 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event.mpb:
          Removed ec_typed_events as base. This resulted in problems in
          building other orbsvcs which then use the ec_typed_events.mpb
          which is located in $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs/orbsvcs. This restores
          the situation to the previous situation and in meantime we can
          figure out a better solution.

Fri Jan 16 15:01:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp:
          For checking if we are building statically use ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS and
          not ACE_HAS_STATIC_LIBS. With this fix this tests runs again in the
          BCB6 static build.

Fri Jan 16 11:27:01 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Service_Config_DLL_Export.h:
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Fri Jan 16 11:25:32 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/APG/Svc_Config/HASTATUS_export.h
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Fri Jan 16 09:57:45 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/DLL_Test.bor:
        * tests/DLL_Test.cpp:
          Changed this test so that it works in MPC and non-MPC builds.
          We use always the decorator string for the dll name.

Fri Jan 16 08:56:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ec_typed_events.mpb:
          Added this file. When the feature ec_typed_events is available,
          we must link with the IFRClient and DynamicInterface library.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/event.mpb:
          Add ec_typed_events as parent project. When ec_typed_events is
          available projects using event should link with the extra needed
          libraries. This fixes the link errors in the BCB6 Static build.

Thu Jan 15 20:54:38 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * configure.ac:

          Require GNU Autoconf 2.58 or better, not 2.57g or better.
          Version 2.57g was a testing release not a stable release.

          Use more comprehensive (custom) test for detecting shm_open()
          support instead of AC_CHECK_FUNC.  In particular, use
          AC_LINK_IFELSE so that we can detect missing function prototype
          errors.  Addresses a problem on Solaris builds where shm_open()
          support was incorrectly detected as available despite the fact
          POSIX.1b support was not enabled.

          Removed ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION test.  This macro is
          no longer used.

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_resource.h:

          Include <sys/procfs.h> in the ACE_HAS_PROC_FS case.  It is
          necessary to pull in the "prusage_t" typedef.  That typedef is
          used later in this header.  Addresses an ACE+autoconf build
          problem on Solaris.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Corrected quoting problem that caused "--enable-fast" help
          string to be echoed incorrectly.

        * m4/acinclude.m4:

          Corrected typo in warning message.

        * m4/compiler.m4:

          Updated Sun C++ 5.0 configuration settings to match those in the
          latest platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU file.

        * m4/config_h.m4 (AH_BOTTOM):

          Added empty line to text appended to generated `config.h' file
          to correct a "non-empty ending line" warning exhibited by Sun
          C++ 5.0.

          (ACE_HAS_MINIMUM_IOSTREAMH_INCLUSION):

          Removed template for this preprocessor macro.  It is no longer
          used.

Thu Jan 15 20:33:09 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ACE-development-process.html (HREF):

          Added a small writeup about the features of BFO.

Thu Jan 15 19:47:13 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/avstreams.mpb:
          Avstreams uses the feature qos, so when qos=1 is set in the
          default.features file we use the ACE_QoS library. Projects
          using avstreams should also use this feature, so that they also
          link with ACE_QoS when qos=1. This fixes link errors in the
          BCB6 Static Build.

Thu Jan 15 18:50:42 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile problem in BCB6 Unicode build

Thu Jan 15 18:42:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/portablegroup.mpb:
          PortableGroup uses iormanip, so also projects using portablegroup
          need this. This fixes the compile problems in the BCB6 Static
          build.

Thu Jan 15 18:33:16 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/C++NPv1/Process_Per_Connection_Logging_Server.cpp:
          Use ACE_OS::strcpy instead of strcpy to fix compile problem in
          BCB6 Static build.

Thu Jan 15 11:12:45 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt-min_moc.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Removed the command options from the command setting and put them
          into the commandflags settings.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/cbx.mpd:

          Added the initial support for custom build types.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcp.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in this template where the !ENDIF for custom build
          types would be missing.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Added user dependencies for custom build types.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd:

          Fixed the user dependencies for custom build types such that it is
          not hard coded to be the CIAO IDL compiler for all custom build
          types.

Thu Jan 15 16:47:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcorbacommon.mpb:
          The rtcorbacommon library needs portableserver and doesn't build
          when minimum_corba is set

Thu Jan 15 08:02:23 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (get_port_number_from_name): Changed
          initial value of port_number from 0 to -1.  Thanks to
          Stephen Moon <stephenm@sychron.com> for this fix.

Thu Jan 15 16:06:54 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Export/test_export.h:
        * ace/TMCast/Export.hpp:
          Added check for ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS for setting the export flags for
          proper building of static libraries.

Thu Jan 15 16:03:11 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay/Bounded_Packet_Relay.mpc:
        * examples/Synch/Synch.mpc:
          Added new mpc files for these examples

Thu Jan 15 08:14:08 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added documentation for keyword mapping which will allow users to
          map custom defined keywords into the project level scope.
          Removed support for the idlpreprocessor keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core.mpb:

          Changed core = 1 into a verbatim clause that enbles the removal of
          the core keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/vcpartialmacros.mpt:

          Removed the ACE specific precompiled headers macro.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:

          Propagated change from GNUACEProjectCreator on Wed Jan  7 06:24:54
          2004.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
          Added support for keyword mapping which will allow users to map
          custom defined keywords into the project level scope.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the workspace output to allow a user to make a specific
          target within the workspace.  If the user specified target
          requires other projects, then those projects are built also.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Version.pm:

          Updated the version number of MPC.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Warn about circular dependencies between projects.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:

          Added verbatim markers, removed the use of the core keyword in
          favor of the verbatim used to get the same effect.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in this template where TAO_ORBSVCS was not being
          handled properly.
          Removed the use of the idlpreprocessor keyword in favor of the
          verbatim used to get the same effect.
