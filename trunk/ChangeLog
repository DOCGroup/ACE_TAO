Tue Jun 24 18:38:33 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

	* bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
	  Added Notify Basic test for RT_Notification.
	  Moved the Notify Lanes and Threadpool test with the other
	  Notify tests.

Tue Jun 24 15:47:16 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_client.mpb: Added
	  $(CIAO_ROOT)/ciao to idlflags.

	  Added $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs/orbsvcs to libpaths and linking
	  Security to even a simple stub DLL because of the way
	  components.idl is being set up.  (Hint: we really don't need
	  them.)

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_component.mpb: Reorganized
	  the template since I moved some of the libraries to ciao_client
	  to fix the components.idl definition problem.

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb: Added this new
	  template to isolate customize CIDL rules for servant DLLs.  It
	  turned out they also requires the stuff defined in the
	  Deployment module (thus, the CIAO_Server library.)

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd: Added code to define
	  CIAO_ROOT in Makefiles if it's not defined already.

	  Thanks to Chad Elliott for helping me setting up the custom
	  rules for CIDL compiler and answering my tons of questions.

          it isn't possible, continue to use environment variables.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Push the relative() method into the ProjectCreator, where it
          should have been in the first place.

          Added the subdirectories under os_include so they'll get
          included in the documentation.

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Broke out the Naming Service flat-file persistence tests and
          added a new Redundant Naming Service test.  Both these tests
          are disabled on mininum CORBA.

Sun Jun 22 11:23:52 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * THANKS: Added our 1700th contributor to ACE+TAO.  It's amazing
          how many people have contributed to these open-source projects
          since 1992!

Mon Jun 23 11:51:13 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed include of OS.h and/or ACE.h from headers and adjusted
          includes in headers and other files by including appropriate

          subsetting effort.

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/Asynch_IO.cpp:
        * ace/Asynch_IO.h:
          Changed u_long to unsigned long to help remove dependencies.
          Moved the typedef for TRANSMIT_FILE_BUFFERS here from OS.h.

        * ace/Functor.h:

Fri Jun 20 13:32:21 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (PLATFORM_SSL_CPPFLAGS):

          Some Linux OpenSSL installations compile in Kerberos support.
          Add the Kerberos include path to preprocessor include path.
          Fixes build problems on Red Hat 9 installations.  Note that this

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Switch this to be a project instead of a feature.  It doesn't hurt
          to inherit from it if you don't use the MOC_Files component.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:

          Added + and - to the escape_regex_special() method.

Fri Jun 20 09:52:44 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added inheritance from qt_moc and qt_reactor.  These will only be
          processed if the 'qt' feature is enabled.

        * ace/qt_reactor.mpb:

          Added QtReactor_moc.cpp to the list of files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added inheritance from the qt base project.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt.mpb:

          Contains the basic feature definition for qt libs and apps.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/qt_moc.mpb:

          Contains the custom definition for MOC files.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ArrayHandle.pm:

          Removed this file.  It isn't necessary anymore.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed the way feature files are read.  This new way is better
          and less hacky.

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Don't modify the file if no precompiled header is found.

Fri Jun 20 14:28:12 UTC 2003  Johnny WIllemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
          Updated this file because of the os splitting.

Fri Jun 20 09:08:05 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Fixed the usage to display the correct options.

Fri Jun 20 08:54:29 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added code to process type specific assignments that may be
          defined within a feature.

Fri Jun 20 08:10:11 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Added documentation about the new feature project type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:

          Defaulted the qt feature to disabled.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ArrayHandle.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Creator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Parser.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          The majority of the code for handling feature project went in
          here.  One main thing that was changed is that instead of using
          the <$fh> paradigm to read files, the following is used
          $_ = $fh->getline().  This is compatible with the new ArrayHandle
          module that I added.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/Options.pm:

          Added a missing space in the completion command.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed the code to match some new methods added in Creator and
          ProjectCreator.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the BUILD target wouldn't be updated when the
          project had component requirements.

Thu Jun 19 12:14:31 2003  Gan Deng <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst

          Added the latency tests for sequences of various data types.

Thu Jun 19 11:36:14 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Updated the GNUACE template to issue information as to why a
          particular project wasn't built based on the comps, requires and
          avoids values.

Thu Jun 19 12:18:22 UTC 2003  Don Hinton  <dhinton@dresystems.com>

          Andzik <andzik@rtlogic.com> for help tracking this down.

        * ace/os_include/os_netdb.h:
          Removed the VXWORKS tests for hostent and servent.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug with multiple 'specific' scopes in a single project.

Thu Jun 19 07:13:16 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/README:

          Documented the existing 'specific' keyword.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to specify multiple project types with the
          'specific' scope.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          ACE_LD_SEARCH_PATH_SEPARATOR_STR.  Thanks to John Michael
          Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for reporting the problem.

Thu Jun 19 07:01:57 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h: Since LynxOS lacks sys/select.h and
          dlfcn.h header files, config file needs ACE_LACKS_DLFCN_H
          and ACE_LACKS_SYS_SELECT_H to be defined. Thanks to  Olli Savia
          <ops@iki.fi> for the patch.

Thu Jun 19 06:35:26 2003  John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net>

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Patches to get ACE building on OSX10.2
          again.

Thu Jun 19 00:27:38 2003  Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Timeprobe.h:
        * ace/Timeprobe.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.cpp:
        * ace/Timeprobe_T.h:

          Advanced new timeprobe. New features are a
          ring buffer for elements kept in data structure.
          This eliminates the ACE_ASSERT when an element
          is attempted to be inserted into a full data
          structure. Old data is overwritten until the
          cache is read and cleared.

          Timeprobes now include a second argument to
          allow for an ACE_ALLOCATOR. This allocator allows
          for the data structure that will contain the
          ACE_Timeprobes to be done in the constructor. A
          new function called 'increase_size' allows for
          the data structure to increase the number of
          measurements it can take. It does so by creating a
          new structure with the new size and copying the
          elements from the old structure.

        * ace/Metrics_Cache_T.h:
        * ace/Metrics_Cache_T.i:

          Added new Metrics Cache.

        * ACE/ace/OS.h:

          Added two new macros called ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN
          and ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY. ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY_RETURN
          returns an array of class pointers with their space
          preallocated and each entry initialized. If there is
          an error the value contained in RET_VAL is returned.
          ACE_NEW_MALLOC_ARRAY is the same but there is no
          return of a value if there is an error.

          sys/socket.h.

        * ace/OS.h:
          Commented out remLib.h and sysLib.h since they don't appear to
          be used by ACE at all.

        * ace/OS.h:

          For custom defined values, convert $(...) to the corresponding
          environment variable accessor, if it is required.  Custom builds
          done in the MS based IDE's are placed in a batch file and then
          executed.  For this particular case, $(...) doesn't work so we
          convert the values on assignment.

Wed Jun 18 07:38:26 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          with precompiled headers.

Tue Jun 17 14:42:25 2003  Gautam H. Thaker  <gthaker@atl.lmco.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/Options_Manager.cpp:

          Change was necessary for build on RH 9.0 to work properly.
          Change consisted of moving the definition of IPPROTO_SCTP

          ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex and also changed the
          ACE_Condition_Thread_Mutex to
          ACE_Condition_Recursive_Thread_Mutex.  This should fix bugs with
          deadlock.  Thanks to Thomas Groth <groth.th@nord-com.net> for
          providing these patches.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp (symbol): Added missing newlines in

            with not additions, and places all additions inside the extern
            "C" {}'s.  Rearranged some of the #ifdef's and moved includes to
            the top of the files so that only those headers that need to be
            are couched in extern "C".

          with exe dependencies and wasn't necessary in the first place.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          reference in case a referenced environment variable doesn't
          exist.
