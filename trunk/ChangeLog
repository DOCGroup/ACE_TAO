	* include/makeinclude/platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU:
	* include/makeinclude/platform_linux_lxpthreads.GNU:

	  Renamed `platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU' to
	  platform_linux_lxpthreads.GNU to be consistent with the name of
	  its corresponding config header `config-linux-lxpthreads.h'.

	  `platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU' now includes the newly renamed
	  file for backward compatibility.

Fri Apr 28 11:54:21 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/SString.cpp: Fixed the delimiter_replace() method so that
	  it actually does what it's comment implies...  Thanks to Martin
 	  Krumpolec <krumpo@pobox.sk> for reporting this.

Thu Apr 27 18:19:19 2000  James Hu  <jxh@entera.com>

        * ace/Dirent.i: Added checks to see if dirp_ is initialized
          before calling into ACE_OS.

Thu Apr 27 16:53:49 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.cpp (unbind_all_i): Added new method
	  unbind_all() for removing all the entries in one shot.  Thanks
	  to Boris Sukholitko <boris@WebGlide.com> for providing this
	  enhancement.

	* tests/Hash_Map_Manager_Test.cpp: Added test for unbind_all().

Thu Apr 27 14:17:52 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.i:

          isatty (): Messed up on my CE change, so the version that
          takes an int was hidden by a ACE_WIN32 block.  This has been
          moved outside again.

        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Weird, somehow part of a section that should have been removed
          with the CE changes was still present.  Removed again.

Thu Apr 27 13:08:00 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Changed the code style and made it consistent.

          Also changed the core build to build all of the orbsvcs and
          do the static builds in the right order.

        * ace/OS.cpp:
        * ace/OS.i:

          For some reason, I had trouble with the libraries when the
          ACE_Cleanup destructor was in the .i file.  So I moved it to
          the .cpp file instead.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

          Was defining ACE_ACE_HAS_DLL=1, which is #1, not needed and,
          #2, the wrong macro name.

        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:

          Changed the static configs to be of type Win32 Static Release/
          Debug instead of Win32 Release/Debug.

        * apps/gperf/src/gperf.dsp:
        * apps/gperf/src/gperf_lib.dsp:

          Added Win32 Static Release/Debug configs.

Thu Apr 27 14:32:45 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ACE-INSTALL (make): Updated the documentation.  Thanks to
	  Ken Weinert <kenw@ihs.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/OS.i:
        * ace/OS.cpp:
        * ace/config-freebsd-pthread.h:
        * ace/README:

          Removed ACE_HAS_TIME_R in favor of using existing
          mechanism of ACE_HAS_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS, and then
          adding ACE_LACKS_NETDB_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS and
          also ACE_LACKS_PWD_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS.  Created a
          new lacks called ACE_LACKS_RAND_REENTRANT_FUNCTIONS
          to match the previous two.  FreeBSD can now use its
          native *time_r functions.

Thu Apr 27 10:55:11 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        These changes bring the Windows CE port up to date.  It currently
        supports Windows CE 2.11 on the H/PC Pro.  I am looking into the 2.11
        P/PC port, but there are other problems with it still.  Hopefully
        the WinCE 3.0 SDK will be more mature.

        * ace/ace_dll_ce.dsp: (added)
        * ace/ace_ce_dll.dsp: (removed)
        * ace/ace_ce.dsw:

          Created a new dsp file from scratch from CE to see how the
          toolkit sets up the projects.  Removed the old one.

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          format_hexdump (): Changed usage of isprint to ACE_OS::ace_isprint.

          get_ip_interfaces (): Changed use of deprecated ACE_TEXT_STRING to
          ACE_TString.  Also added an ACE_TEXT_CHAR_TO_TCHAR to a use
          of the ACE_INET_Addr constructor.

        * ace/ARGV.cpp:

          create_buf_from_queue (): We were not adjusting the size of a
          ACE_TCHAR buffer by sizeof ACE_TCHAR when we did a memcopy.
          Thanks to Valery Arkhangorodsky <valerya@servicesoft.com>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp:

          seh_selector (): Changed use of LPEXCEPTION_POINTERS to
          EXCEPTION_POINTERS * since it seems like that definition is
          missing in some WinCE configs.

        * ace/ace_wchar.h:

          Added deprecated definition of ACE_TEXT_STRING.

          convert (): Changed the conversions from CharToOem to
          MultiByteToWideChar, since it is more widely supported in Win32.
          Also removed the loading of user32.lib since it was only needed
          for CharToOem.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:

          Changed the _MT check so it doesn't do anything on CE.  Some
          CE targets do not have the Multithreaded DLL generation option.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:

          Changed ACE_DEFAULT_LD_SEARCH_PATH to use ACE_TEXT.

          Added a define for ACE_HAS_WCHAR and a check to always define
          ACE_USES_WCHAR.

          Commented out the ACE_HAS_MFC check.

          Defined FILE, since it seems to be missing from CE 2.11 H/PC Pro.

          Added a definition for EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION that was in
          older SDK's.

          Removed some UNDER_CE < 2.11 defines.  < 2.11 CE will not be
          supported anymore.

          Removed definition of is_print, since it was moved into ACE_OS.

          Added a definition for the operator placement new, which is
          missing when MFC isn't used.

        * ace/OS.h:

          Enabled is_atty for Windows CE.  Added ace_isprint and made
          ace_isspace an ACE_TCHAR method.

        * ace/OS.i:

          chdir (): NOTSUP on CE 2.11

          tempnam (): Also NOTSUP on CE 2.11

          abort (): changed ::exit to exit to get it to compile.

          ace_isspace (): Changed to use ACE_TCHAR, but also made it
          NOTSUP on CE 2.11.

          ace_isprint (): Added, but NOTSUP on CE 2.11.

          sema_init (): Needed to cast an void *arg to ACE_mutexattr_t.

          dlsym (): Changed the way ACE declares symbolname so it uses the
 	  right one on Win32 (WinNT always uses char *, CE always uses
 	  wchar_t *).  The function still takes in ACE_TCHAR * though.
  	  Thanks to Jeff Greif <jmg@trivida.com> for reporting this.

          Removed a few global function definitions that were just for
          CE (like fwrite, fread, getc, etc.).  These are either supported
          in newer CE's or is disabled in the ACE_OS methods.

          is_atty (): Enabled on CE.

        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Enabled fopen on CE by using _wfopen (but not sure if this will
          work correctly, since on other Win32 platforms we have a lot more
          stuff.

          Enabled several printf methods on CE.

          open (): Removed the use of FILE_SHARE_DELETE on CE.

        * ace/Service_Config.i:

          initialize (): Added an ACE_TEXT_CHAR_TO_TCHAR and replaced
          an ACE_WIDE_STRING with it also.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          ace_yyerror (): Takes an ACE_TCHAR * instead of char * now.
          Thanks to Valery Arkhangorodsky <valerya@servicesoft.com>
          for also reporting this.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.l:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp:

          Changed to use ACE_OS::isatty () and ACE_OS::ace_isprint.

Thu Apr 27 11:49:52 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (memchr): Do not cast away constness when emulating
	  memchr().  Thanks to Rick Ohnemus <rjohnemus@systemware-inc.com>
 	  for reporting this.

	* ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp (open): The notification pipe handlers
	  created by the ACE_Select_Reactor_Notify::open were being left
 	  open after fork() and exec().  Thanks to Rick Ohnemus
 	  <rjohnemus@systemware-inc.com> for reporting this.

Wed Apr 26 23:47:31 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Process_Manager.cpp (open): Make sure that the dummy I/O
	  handle is not inherited by child processes.  Thanks to Rick
 	  Ohnemus <rjohnemus@systemware-inc.com> for reporting this.

Wed Apr 26 20:32:59 2000  James C. Hu  <jxh@entera.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp:
        * ace/OS.i:
        * ace/README:
        * ace/config-freebsd-pthread.h:
	  Added a new define ACE_HAS_TIME_R.  FreeBSD supports
	  *time_r() calls, but not gethostbyname_r, so a new feature
	  specification was needed to get these functions into
	  ACE_OS.

Wed Apr 26 12:21:16 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (send_n_i (ACE_HANDLE, const void *, size_t, int) and
          send_n_i (ACE_HANDLE, const void *, size_t): If the send fails
          with EWOULDBLOCK, wait for the handle to become writeable again
          before retrying the send. Thanks to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com>
          for reporting this.

        * tests/SOCK_Send_Recv_Test.cpp: Added test 3 for send_n to verify
          fix for writing to nonblocking handle.

Tue Apr 25 15:11:41 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:
          Add new member to the list.

Tue Apr 25 11:35:07 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/Local_Name_Space.cpp:

          The hash function was using the wrong length of the USHORT16
          string representation.  The len_ actually is the length in bytes,
          not characters.

Tue Apr 25 08:57:59 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ASNMP/tests/test_config.h:

          Was using XXX_A and XXX_W macros which really do not make sense
          anymore.  Removed them and replaced with just the XXX macro which
          uses ACE_TEXT.

        * examples/Naming/test_multiple_contexts.cpp:
        * examples/Naming/test_non_existent.cpp:
        * examples/Naming/test_writers.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Misc/test_naming.cpp:
        * tests/Naming_Test.cpp:
        * tests/SString_Test.cpp:

          All of these were still being disabled when ACE_HAS_WCHAR wasn't
          defined.  Since the naming stuff was changed to work without
          ACE_HAS_WCHAR, these were reenabled.

Tue Apr 25 00:02:08 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h (ACE_Log_Msg): Split msg_ostream() into two functions,
          one of which allows the delete_ostream_ flag to be reset and the
          other that doesn't.  Thanks to Boris Sukholitko
          <palisander@hotmail.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Message_Block.i (replace_data_block): If a data block is replaced
          with a NULL pointer then don't bother doing certain operations!
          Thanks to Boris Sukholitko <palisander@hotmail.com> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/OS.i (dlerror): Changed sizeof buf to sizeof buf / sizeof buf[0]
          to avoid over-allocating a buffer in the
          ACE_TEXT_FormateMessage() function.  Thanks to Valery
          Arkhangorodsky <valerya@servicesoft.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp: The fini() method was claiming
          it was the close() method.  Likewise, changed the close() method
          so that it keeps decrementing the current_size each time through
          the look to allow checking the respository size or doing other
          work from inside the fini() call.  Thanks to Valery
          Arkhangorodsky <valerya@servicesoft.com> for reporting this.

Mon Apr 24 17:44:21 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:

          Ai Carumba!  I disabled some stuff here a while back when
          I first disabled the Naming Service, but forgot to enable
          it again once I fixed that.

Mon Apr 24 16:44:22 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/SString.i:

          A couple of compilers were having problems with some
          casting I was doing in a const hash method.  Changed the
          types of casts to hopefully make the compilers happy.

Mon Apr 24 10:04:51 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp:

          Another problem with a missing parenthesis.

Mon Apr 24 09:15:03 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.i:

          Forgot a couple of ')'s that showed up on Lynx builds.

          Also, ACE_const_char doesn't exist, ACE_const_cast does.

Sun Apr 23 19:51:41 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.cpp:

          Just tried the ACE_USES_WCHAR build and there were a couple
          of things that needed updating.  Mainly some missing ACE_TEXT's
          or char's used instead of ACE_TCHAR's.

        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Was still using an old ACE_DEFAULT_MUTEX_A macro (updated to
          ACE_DEFAULT_MUTEX).

        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:

          Added "static" to the config names (Win32 Debug => Win32 Static
          Debug) so it is easier for the msvc_auto_compile.pl script to
          figure out which is which.

Sun Apr 23 18:14:33 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ace_wchar.h:

          Added compatibility for all the old ASYS_* macros by default.
          But no part of ACE/TAO should still use them anymore.  This
          compatibility can be turned off by defining
          ACE_ONLY_LATEST_AND_GREATEST.

        * ace/SString.cpp:
        * ace/SString.h:

        * ace/Remote_Name_Space.h:

          Found a better way of support for the ACE_Name_Space classes when
          there isn't a wchar_t.  We now define the ACE_WString to internally
          use a type called ACE_WSTRING_TYPE, which is defined to wchar_t
          unless ACE_USES_WCHAR is not defined (in which case it is defined
          to ACE_USHORT16).

        * tests/IOStream_Test.cpp:

          Found some old ASYS macros still hanging around in code that wasn't
          enabled on NT.

        * ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp:
        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:

          Fixed some wchar related changes.

Sat Apr 22 20:53:11 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

          This is my first checkin of my Unicode changes.  They should be
          mostly harmless, since most platforms and build do not use Unicode
          stuff, in which these changes *should* result in the exact same
          behavior as before.

          But, if Unicode was being used, then chances are it is not going
          to work without a few changes.  A summary of the changes are:

          - Standardized wide char support to the following macros:

            ACE_HAS_WCHAR - if not defined, ACE will not use the type wchar_t
                            or provide any of the functions that use it.
            ACE_USES_WCHAR - if defined, ACE will use wchar_t instead of char
                             for its strings (but not its buffers).

            This support has been mostly completed, but there are still some
            loose ends that need to be cleaned up.

            Note also that even if ACE_USES_WCHAR is defined or not, both
            wide and narrow versions of the string operations will be
            available.

          - Removed all the ASYS_* macros (besides ASYS_INLINE).  So all code
            using ASYS_TEXT and ASYS_TCHAR should now use ACE_TEXT and
            ACE_TCHAR.  And unlike their predecessers, these *will* turn into
            wide character versions when ACE_USES_WCHAR is defined.

          - Removed the macros ACE_HAS_WCHAR_TYPEDEFS_USHORT and
            ACE_HAS_WCHAR_TYPEDEFS_CHAR since ACE will not depend on what
            wchar_t defaults to.

          - Messed around with Windows CE support, most likely it broke it
            even more.  I've halted my work on Windows CE until after this
            change, so I'll be fixing it up in upcoming checkins.

          - Since ACE_WString was changed, everything using it will now
            not be available when ACE_HAS_WCHAR is not defined.

          The motivation for this change was that the Unicode support was
          a mess and was very unintuitive.  Since I was given the job of
          maintaining it (since I'm doing Windows CE stuff now), I decided
          to fix it instead of try to figure out what was currently
          happening.  A consistent design is much easier to explain and
          maintain.

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE.i:
        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/ARGV.cpp:

          Removed ACE's strecpy since all it did was call ACE_OS's strecpy.

        * ace/ace_wchar.h: (added)

          Moved all the unicode specific stuff here.

        * ace/SString.cpp:
        * ace/SString.h:
        * ace/SString.i:

          ACE_WString used to use ACE_USHORT16 instead of wchar_t.  I
          changed it so it does, since it will be more useful and intuitive
          this way.

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp:

          We were using ACE_OS::fwrite to print the string.  This didn't work
          when the string was wchar_t, so this was changed to ACE_OS::fprintf
          instead.

          Made all the appropriate changes to support the new wide char
          policy.  Most changes were macro changes, changing ASYS_* to
          ACE_*, changing char's to ACE_TCHAR's, adding in ACE_TEXT ()'s
          when necessary, etc.

          ACE_SOCK_Dgram_Mcast and handles all the QoS functionality that
          was being done by the latter.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp: Added the ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.{cpp,i,h}

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Removed all chdir's and fixed a bug with specifying multiple -dir's.

        * websvcs/lib/URL_Addr.cpp:
          The URL schemes are supposed to be case insensitive, thanks to
          Paul Carreiro <pcarreir@genuity.com> for pointing this out.

Thu Apr 20 21:05:42 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl:

          Added a -core for only the core libraries.  Also fixed a problem
          with specifying incorrect directories and the -DLL/-Debug/etc.
          macros.

          Fixed miscellaneous problems with these projects and workspaces.
          Some projects were missing from workspaces or listed incorrectly.
          Many project didn't have the correct include paths or definitions.

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/post_completion.dsp: (removed)

          There was already a post_completions.dsp that was being used.

        * examples/OS/Process/imore.cpp:
        * examples/OS/Process/process.cpp:

          Changed the type of the variables used with Process::wait from

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/test_abandoned.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/test_apc.cpp:

          Missing parentheses.

        * Synch-Benchmarks/Synch_Lib/Synch_Lib.dsp:

          Changed the name of the project so win32_auto_compile.pl works
          with it properly.

        * bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl: (added)

          This is a new script for autocompiling with MSVC 6.
          Eventually this should replace auto_compile_win32.pl.  It still
          needs more directories added to it and tested before we put it
          into production

        * bin/vc_filter.pl:

          Updated to properly color code output from msvc_auto_compile.pl
          also.

        * ace/RB_Tree.h:
        * ace/RB_Tree.i:
          Fixed implementation of the end() method.  It should return a
          singular iterator that is different from all valid iterator, not
          an iterator pointing to the last element in the collection.

Thu Apr 20 08:53:31 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
          Fixed problem in the align_write_ptr() method.  It was optimized
          for the case where there was enough room in the current buffer,
          but the optimization broke with a previous fix from Feb 29.

Wed Apr 19 21:53:52 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Bounded_Packet_Relay: Added some missing template
          instantiations and other assorted problems.  Thanks to Aoxiang
          Xu <axu@cim.mcgill.ca> for reporting these.

Wed Apr 19 07:04:13 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp (copy_nodes): insert_head() should have
          been insert_tail().  Thanks to Umar Syyid for clarifying this.
          Also, added some comments to explain what's going on in
          insert_tail() since the code was somewhat non-intuitive ;-).

        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Queue_Based_Workers/workers.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Server_Concurrency/Leader_Follower/leader_follower.cpp:
          They wouldn't compile on platforms that lack context switch
          counters in rusage.  Conditionally compile that code to avoid
          the problem.

Wed Apr 19 14:09:29 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Stream.i:
          The new <error_on_eof> flag was present but not used in several
          methods, just forward them to the ACE::xxx() operation.

Wed Apr 19 08:18:30 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * */Makefile:
          Updated all the dependencies

Wed Apr 19 09:44:14 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Changed the signature of a (WIN32-specific) call to
          send_n, to resolve a function overload ambiguity on NT.

Wed Apr 19 00:00:29 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace: There are two general use cases of the _n() methods:

          (1) The method keeps looping, until all the data has been
          transmitted, or until timeout occurs, or until the handle is
          closed.  This use case occurs when one does not know how much
          data is coming across in the case of a recv(), or one wants to
          know exactly how much data was sent in the case of a send().
          And one don't want to treat a premature eof as an error but
          wants to know the exact number of bytes that have been
          transferred so far.

          (2) In other cases when one knows exactly how much data is
          coming across in the case of recv(), or how much data needs to
          be transmitted in the case of a send(). Premature closing of the
          handle is usually an error.

          By adding an additional <error_on_eof> parameter to all the _n()
          methods, the above two use cases can be distinguished.  The
          following files were modified:

          - OS
          - ACE
          - SOCK_Stream
          - TLI_Stream

          The other IO classes such as FIFO, MEM_IO, PIPE, etc., should
          also include this change.  However, they should first get fixed
          with respect to timeouts.  If <error_on_eof> comes before
          timeouts, ordering of the parameters will get messed up.

          Thanks to Steffen Winther Sorensen <sts@siimnet.dk> for
          reporting this second use of the _n() methods.

        * ace/OS.h: t_snd() interface was fixed.  The buffer parameter
          should be const.

        * ace/ACE: Added support for TLI I/O functions to the ACE class.

Tue Apr 18 19:08:37 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/config-all.h: (added)

        * ace/NT_Service.h:

        * ace/OS.h:

          Started moving several of the macros from OS.h to config-all.h.
          The plan is to eventually split up OS.h, and config-all is a
          place where the macros (which are not specific to any part of
          ACE_OS) can go.  config-all.h also ate inc_user_config.h.

          Since inc_user_config.h was eaten, needed to change includes of
          it to config-all.h.

        * bin/generate_export_file.pl: (added)
        * bin/GenExportH.BAT: (removed)

          Replaced the batch file with a perl file so
          - people can generate on other platforms
          - it can generate Word_export and WORD_BUILD_DLL
            (the batch file couldn't change the case of the key)

        * ace/ACE_export.h: (added)
        * ace/svc_export.h: (added)

          Took the existing ACE_Export and ACE_Svc_Export macro and
          moved them to separate files.  Also tested out the new
          generate_export_file.pl.

          other libraries in ACE and TAO.

Tue Apr 18 21:32:21 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (sema_init): Fixed another problem that required
          a cast to ACE_mutexattr_t *.  Thanks to Priyanka for
          reporting this.

Tue Apr 18 19:39:41 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch.cpp,
        * ace/OS.cpp: Added a cast to ACE_mutexattr_t *.  Thanks to
          Darrell for pointing this out.

Tue Apr 18 15:18:53 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h,
        * ace/OS.i,
        * ace/Synch.h,
        * ace/Synch.cpp: Updated the ACE_OS::*mutex_init() methods (and the
          corresponding ACE_Thread_Mutex, ACE_Mutex, and
          ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex classes) so that they now take an
          optional ACE_mutexattr_t * rather than just a void *.  This is
          nice because it makes it possible to pass in special attributes,
          such as the mutex prioceiling attribute, to the underlying
          pthreads mutex (assuming we're running on pthreads, of course).
          Thanks to lafortg@res.raytheon.com for motivating this.

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp (copy_nodes): Added a call to the
          allocator->malloc() rather than new.  Thanks to Umar Syyid
          <usyyid@hns.com> for reporting this.

Tue Apr 18 14:06:32 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          Patch to ACE_CDR::consolidate() sent in by Carlos, that
          fixes a bug reported by Harald Finster <finster@ave.ac.agit.de>,
          and an added check for 0 value of the 'length' arg in
          read_array() and write_array(), that fixes [Bug 540],
          reported by Mathew Samuel <Mathew.Samuel@msdw.com>.

Tue Apr 18 11:47:57 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Connector.cpp:

          Removed inclusion of `ace/Handle_Set.h'.  The ACE_SOCK_Connector
          doesn't directly use an ACE_Handle_Set.

        * ace/Makefile:

          Updated dependencies.

Tue Apr 18 08:54:04 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * bin/vc_filter.pl:

          Brand spankin' new filter script for Win32 auto build results.

Sun Apr 16 22:24:34 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Updated the link for GNU make to be more
          specific.  Thanks to Xiaojun Wu <depender@yahoo.com> for
          reporting this.  BTW, Xiaojun was the 900th contributor to
          ACE+TAO, so he gets a free copy of ACE+TAO!

Mon Apr 17 20:10:18 2000  Vishal  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.1.1 released.

Mon Apr 17 16:33:17 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * acconfig.h (ACE_LACKS_ACE_OTHER, ACE_LACKS_ACE_SVCCONF,
          ACE_LACKS_ACE_TOKEN):

          Added support for these macros.  They are used when enabling
          subsetting.

        * configure.in:

          lseek64() and llseek() test has been moved to
          `m4/acinclude.m4'.

          Include `sys/types.h' when running the TLI/XTI tests.  Some
          platforms use typedefs such as "ulong" but such typedefs may not
          be defined in the TLI/XTI headers.

          (ACE_HAS_BROKEN_T_ERROR):

          Corrected test for broken t_error().  A variable, "errmsg" was
          being passed to the t_error() call in the test, but the variable
          was declared as "ace_errmsg."  Thanks to Roland Gigler
          <roland@mch.pn.siemens.de> for pointing this out.

          (ACE_MAJOR, ACE_MINOR, ACE_BETA):

          If any of these variables is evaluates to the empty string, then
          set it to zero.  This fixes a problem that was occuring when the
          the ACE version contained no beta number (e.g. "5.1" instead
          "5.1.0").  Libtool didn't like the fact that one of the numbers
          was an empty string.

        * ace/Makefile.am (libACE_IPC_la_SOURCES, libACE_Other_la_SOURCES,
          HEADER_FILES, INLINE_FILES):

          Synchronized the sources associated with these Makefile
          variables with those in the classical ACE Makefile.

        * m4/acinclude.m4 (ACE_CHECK_LSEEK64):

          Moved checks for lseek64() and llseek() from configure.in to
          this file.  The beginnings of a test for a 64 bit offset type
          have also been added, but that test is currently not in use.

        * m4/ace.m4 (ACE_COMPILATION_OPTIONS):

          Removed check for exception support in C compiler.  It didn't
          make too much sense to check for exception support in a C
          compiler.

          Since exception support is disabled by default, make sure
          "-fno-exceptions" is set when using g++ with the default ACE
          exception configuration value.

        * m4/compiler.m4 (ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS):

          Fixed typos where "$GXX" was used instead of "$CXX."  "$GXX" is
          set to yes when GNU C++ is being used, and "$CXX" is set to the
          compiler being used (e.g. "c++").  Thanks to Rich Seibel
          <seibel_r@ociweb.com> for pointing this out.

          This also fixes a problem where "-fcheck-new" wasn't being added
          to the C++ flags ($CXXFLAGS).

        * m4/subsets.m4 (ACE_LACKS_ACE_OTHER, ACE_LACKS_ACE_SVCCONF,
          ACE_LACKS_ACE_TOKEN):

          When disabling the "Other," "SvcConf" and/or the "Token" subset,
          then define the corresponding preprocessor macro.

Sat Apr 15 21:49:04 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Options.cpp:

          Nick Pratt <npratt@microstrategy.com> reported two cases where
          we were using sizeof some_string to figure out its length.  This
          of course doesn't work when the string is a wide string, so they
          have been changed to account for the character size.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:
        * apps/gperf/src/gperf.dsp:
        * apps/gperf/src/gperf_lib.dsp:

          Changed around the order of the configurations so that in the
          default case (such as out of the box) the regular Debug version
          will be the current configuration.

Sat Apr 15 19:35:57 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        (On behalf of Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com>)

        * ace/Makefile.bor:

          Added new file QoS_Manager.cpp.

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:
        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.h:

          Added missing pre/post includes.

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_example.bor:

          Updated for new orbsvcs libraries.

Sat Apr 15 18:17:02 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Concrete_Connection_Handlers.cpp:
          Fixed the handle_output() function so that it does the "Right
          Thing"[TM] on Windows NT.  Win32 Winsock doesn't trigger
          multiple "You can write now" signals, so we have to assume that
          we can continue to write until we get another EWOULDBLOCK.
          Thanks to Nick Pratt

Thu Apr 13 16:30:01 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.7.h: added #undef ACE_NEEDS_LWP_PRIO_SET.
          SunOS 5.7 no longer needs it, as shown by
          performance-tests/Misc/preempt (run as superuser).  Thanks
          to John Foresteire <John_J_Foresteire@res.raytheon.com>
          for reporting this.

Tue Apr 11 21:41:20 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile_win32.pl: Updated the lists of
          workspaces/projects to build.

Tue Apr 11 16:15:31 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp: moved ACE_Thread_Exit::is_constructed_
          definition so that it's seen on all platforms, not just
          those that are ACE_MT_SAFE.  Fixes:
          Mon Apr 10 07:30:22 2000  John Rodgers <jrrodgers@acm.org>
          Thanks to Vishal for reporting it.

Tue Apr 11 13:57:11 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.cpp: Make sure to cast the "type" argument to
          "short" to avoid overload confusions by certain compilers.
          Thanks to Charles Taurines <ctaurines@amadeus.net> for reporting
          this.

Tue Apr 11 12:52:04 2000  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp (subscribe): Removed the #ifdef
          for template instantiation.

Tue Apr 11 11:32:03 2000  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>
        * bin/ACEutils.pm

          Refactored duplicate test code into ACEutils.pm

Mon Apr 10 19:45:32 2000  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp (subscribe): Added a #ifdef to
          get past a g++ error. I am looking into the right way to
          do this.

Mon Apr 10 17:37:53 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-freebsd-pthread.h: Addplied John Aughey
          <ajh4@cec.wustl.edu>'s patch for FreeBSD 4.0.

Mon Apr 10 07:30:22 2000  John Rodgers <jrrodgers@acm.org>

        * ace/OS.{h,cpp},Thread_Manager.cpp (instance,~ACE_Thread_Exit):
          added a state variable, is_constructed_, to ACE_Thread_Exit.
          instance () sets it, ~ACE_Thread_Exit () clears it.  This
          allows ACE::init () to be called after ACE::fini (), because
          a new ACE_Thread_Exit instance will be created. [Bug 526]

Sun Apr  9 14:16:23 2000  James CE Johnson  <jcej@mobsec.com>

        * docs/tutorials/015/page01.html : Thanks to Conrad Hughes for
          pointing out that a real implementation would compress before
          encrypting since encrypted data shouldn't really be compressible
          anyway.

        * docs/tutorials/015/Protocol_Stream.cpp (open): Reorder the
          module pushing so that encryption happens before compression.

        * docs/tutorials/015/Crypt.cpp :
        * docs/tutorials/015/Compressor.cpp :
          Add a few extra bytes when creating the new message blocks.  A
          real implementation would probably need that.

Sun Apr 09 00:04:25 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp (remove): Removed invocation of destructor to
          <malloc_stats_>.  It is a member of Control_Block and does not
          require explicit initialization/destruction.  This was causing
          ACE not to compile when ACE_HAS_MALLOC_STATS was defined.
          Thanks to John Smyder <jsmyder@salient.com> for reporting the
          problem.

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp (open): Removed invocation of contructor to
          <malloc_stats_> for the same reason.

Fri Apr 07 23:32:16 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp: Added QoS_Manager.* into project files.

Thu Apr  6 07:29:48 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Token.h (ACE_Token): Clarified the recursive semantics of
          ACE_Token.  Thanks to Antti Valtokari
          <Antti.Valtokari@iocore.fi> for reporting this.

Wed Apr  5 22:59:58 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h: Moved the ACE_HAS_USING_KEYWORD into
          the part of this header file that's enabled when
          __SUNPRO_CC_COMPAT >= 5 is defined.  Thanks to Susan Liebeskind
          <susan.liebeskind@gtri.gatech.edu> for reporting this.

Tue Apr  4 23:50:02 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (sock_error): Changed "int error" to "ssize_t error"
          to be consistent...

Tue Apr  4 20:19:36 2000  <schmidt@rumba.ece.uci.edu>

        * ace/Acceptor.cpp: Modified the implementation of
          ACE_Acceptor::open() and ACE_Acceptor::accept_svc_handler() so
          that the peer acceptor's handle is set into non-blocking mode.
          This is a safe-guard against the race condition that can
          otherwise occur between the time when <select> indicates that a
          passive-mode socket handle is "ready" and when we call <accept>.
          During this interval, the client can shutdown the connection, in
          which case, the <accept> call can hang!

Mon Apr  3 11:09:26 2000  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/QoS_Manager.cpp: Added the #if defined
          (ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION).

Mon Apr  3 08:00:00 2000  Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile: Added <smart_proxies> flag.

Mon Apr  3 04:07:47 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-freebsd-pthread.h: Added a #define for
          ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID so that ACE will build on recent FreeBSD
          releases.  Thanks to Raymond Wiker <raymond@orion.no> for
          reporting this.

Sun Apr  2 21:32:20 2000  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK.cpp: removed the extra #ifdef
          ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_PRAGMA
        * ace/QoS_Manager.{h,cpp}: removed the obsolete #pragma once.
        * ace/QoS_Session_Impl.i: fully qualified the ACE_End_Point_Type.
        * ace/Makefile: Added the QoS_Manager.

Sun Apr  2 20:19:36 2000  Vishal Kachroo  <vishal@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/QoS_Manager.{h,cpp}: Added these two files. They define
          a QoS Manager that manages the QoS for a socket. This was being
          done earlier by the ACE_SOCK classes.

          Changed the following files to accomodate the new classes added
          above.
        * ace/SOCK.{h,cpp}:  Removed the heavy container from ACE_SOCK.
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.{h,cpp}: Changed the QoS management from
          ACE_SOCK to ACE_QoS_Manager.

        * ace/QoS_Session_Impl.{h,cpp}:
        * ace/QoS_Session.h: Changed the interface to use the
          ACE_QoS_Manager class

Sun Apr  2 05:36:04 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp: There were a number of incorrect uses
          of ACE_NEW_MALLOC that I replaced with ACE_ALLOCATOR.  Thanks to
          Francisco Bravo <emefjbm@madrid.es.eu.ericsson.se> and Chris
          Uzdavinis <chris@atdesk.com> for clarifying the error of my
          ways!

Thu Mar 30 19:25:14 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (suspend_handler_i and resume_handler_i):

          If a handle is resumed, then:

          - check current handles to undo suspension (*)
          - check suspended handles to resume
          - check to_be_added handles to undo suspension

          If a handle is suspended, then:

          - check current handles to suspend
          - check suspended handles to undo resumption (*)
          - check to_be_added handles to suspend

          (*) were missing.  Thanks to Ji Wuliu <jiwuliu0952_cn@sina.com>
          for pointing this out!

Thu Mar 30 15:54:23 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Only set ACE_HAS_SIGTIMEDWAIT for AIX
          4.3.x. 4.2.x doesn't have it. Thanks to Johnny Chen
          <jchen@informatica.com> for reporting this.

        * THANKS: Added Johnny Chen to the Hall of Fame.

Wed Mar 29 00:01:39 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp (handle_input):
          ACE_OS::closesocket() was being used to do some very "low-level"
          closing of handles without assigning a handle to
          ACE_INVALID_HANDLE.  This was causing problems.  Therefore, we
          now try to use this->peer ().close () if it's different from
          handle.  Thanks to Alexander Dergatch <dergy@websci.ru> for
          reporting this.  This fixes [BUGID 520].

Tue Mar 28 12:13:12 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.h: Fixed the mismatching filename in preamble.

Tue Mar 28 12:06:31 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Array.h: Simply include "ace/Containers_T.h" would work.
          Removed all other template kludge since they should be handled
          in Containers_T.h.  Thanks to Airat A. Sadreev
          <airat@hq.tatenergo.ru> for report this problem.

Tue Mar 28 11:56:56 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Dirent.h"
        * ace/Dirent.cpp: The meaning of __ACE_INLINE__ is just the
          opposite of ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS (my fault.)  Rearrange
          the logic for checking __ACE_INLINE__ and include "ace/Dirent.h"
          in Dirent.cpp.

Tue Mar 28 06:00:00 2000  Michael Kircher  <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * Dirent.cpp,
        * Dirent.h: Renamed ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS into __ACE_INLINE__ which
          is the correct way of handling inlining differences.

        * ace/OS.h,
          ace/OS.i: Win32 does not support <dirent> a set of functions to
          retrieve the content of a directory. However, the Win32 functions
          FindFirstFile and FindNextFile provide similar behavior. This change
          added an emulation of dirent based on these functions. Changes were
          made to ACE_OS::opendir, ACE_OS::readdir, and ACE_OS::closedir.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Added the defines ACE_HAS_DIRENT,
          ACE_LACKS_TELLDIR, ACE_LACKS_SEEKDIR, ACE_LACKS_REWINDDIR and
          ACE_LACKS_READDIR_R.
          This was necessary to enable the above mentioned <dirent> emulation.

Mon Mar 27 16:58:03 2000  Yamuna Krishnamurthy  <yamuna@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TkReactor.cpp:
          Fixed the unused variable warning and ACE_Select_Reactor_Token
          undeclared error.

Fri Mar 24 10:30:44 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/LSOCK.cpp (recv_handle): For some reason, Linux allocates an extra
          handle when doing a recvmsg() with the MSG_PEEK flag set.
          Therefore, we need to close this.  Thanks to Rick Ohnemus
          <rjohnemus@systemware-inc.com> for reporting this.  Fixed [BUGID
          511].

        * examples/IPC_SAP/FILE_SAP/client.cpp. Fixed the formatting
          to conform to ACE guidelines.  Thanks to Steve Luoma
          <stevel@dvc400.com> for motivating this.

Thu Mar 23 20:37:19 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/check_build_logs: removed leading "./" from log file names.

Thu Mar 23 17:38:34 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_SAP.cpp: Removed a redundant "defined".  Thanks to David
          Wicks <swicks@continuum-corp.com> for noticing this.

Thu Mar 23 15:26:52 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:
          Modified the text to encourage users to report real bugs to
          Bugzilla, that way we don't have to enter them ourselves.  Only
          dubious stuff should be reported to the mailing list.

Thu Mar 23 14:34:26 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/*.h: Moved the inclusion of <pre.h> down after the
          definition of header guard macro.  The original order violated
          the ACE programming guideline.  Thanks to Carlos for catching
          this.

Wed Mar 23 15:10:01 2000  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/run_tests.sh
          Fixed my fix for Chorus.  It, again, supports FOR_TAO subset.

Thu Mar 23 15:09:22 2000  Jody Hagins <jody@atdesk.com>

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp (ACE_Static_Object_Lock::instance):
          with ACE_SHOULD_MALLOC_STATIC_OBJECT_LOCK #defined,
          use ACE_RETURN_NEW instead of ACE_RETURN so that a value
          is returned by the function.

Thu Mar 23 10:39:23 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/g++dep:
          Changed the script to generate relative paths for local
          dependencies.  In other words if .obj/foo.o in the foo/bar
          directory depends on $(ACE_ROOT)/foo/bar/foo.h we just generate
          .obj/foo.o: foo.h
          instead of the full path.  This solves some problems with
          parallel builds and IDL generated files.

Thu Mar 23 04:31:50 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.i (register_handler): There was a very subtle bug in
          all versions of <register_handler>.  The problem was that once
          the <event_handler> has been successfully registered with the
          Reactor, it is available for processing events.  In the problem
          case, input arrived from the client, the handler handled it, and
          eventually closed down.  All this happened in the other thread
          running the Reactor, and all before this line got executed:

              event_handler->reactor (this);

          By the time this thread came around to set the <reactor>, the
          <event_handler> had packed up and gone home. The fix is to set
          the <reactor> before registering the <event_handler> with the
          <reactor>.  Thanks to Steve Huston for report this bug.

Wed Mar 22 12:01:22 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/NT_Service.{h i cpp}: Added support for operating on services
          on a host other than the local host. Thanks to Stephen Moon
          <smoon@oxmol.co.uk> for adding this new functionality!

Wed Mar 22 10:19:47 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread.i: In ACE_Thread::setcancelstate() the code is
          checking to see if thr_setcancelstate and thr_setcanceltype
          return 0 and if so returning an error condition to the user.
          Instead, both of these routines should be checked to see if they
          return -1 on failure.  Thanks to Umar Syyid for reporting this.

Wed Mar 22 09:29:09 2000  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-chorus.h, ace/ACE.cpp
          Correction for Chorus 4.0 support on the Ultra-SPARC.

Wed Mar 22 09:24:12 2000  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration.cpp: Fixed a link error with SunCC5. This
          error only shows up when ACE  is built with debug=0 and
          exceptions=1. The fix was to move all the template
          instantiations from the end of the file to the top of the
          file. Thanks to Dr.Levine for helping me fix this and thanks to
          Manuel Benche <mbenche@jazz.cs.utsa.edu> for reporting this
          problem.

Wed Mar 22 09:16:48 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
          Initialized a local variable inside the << operator
          for wstring. It was producing a warning on Linux g++
          (charanga).

Tue Mar 21 14:24:07 2000  Chad Elliott <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-chorus.h,
          include/makeinclude/platform_chorus.GNU,
          include/makeinclude/platform_chorus4.x_g++.GNU,
          tests/run_tests.sh:
          Expected ACE tests work.  Added support for Chorus 4.0
          on the Ultra-SPARC.

Tue Mar 21 10:37:17 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged the non_interpretive branch.
          This fixes [BUGID:135]

        Fri Mar 10 11:27:04 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
          Fixed the << operators for ACE_OutputCDR::from_string and
          ACE_OutputCDR::from_wstring. They did not work with null
          strings.

Mon Mar 20 17:54:15 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          The ascii version of get_temp_dir () was calling the wchar_t
          version, which doesn't work on Win95/98 since the GetTempPathW
          isn't supported.  So I just called GetTempPathA directly.

          Thanks to David Hauck <davidh@realtimeint.com> for first pointing
          this out, Shalabh Bhatnagar <shalabh_b@hotmail.com> for informing
          me that it doesn't work on Win95, and Torsten Pfuetzenreuter
          <torsten_pf@geocities.com> for pointing out this doesn't work on
          Win98 either.

          [BUG 499]

Mon Mar 20 12:45:17 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU:
          Updated support for X11 and GL

        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
          A small performance improvement for ACE_InputCDR.  If the
          current message block in not writable we call grow_and_adjust
          immediately.

Sun Mar 19 22:11:47 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (recv_n_i, send_n_i, recvv_n_i, sendv_n_i):

          Loop should continue if EWOULDBLOCK is set.  Previously, calls
          to these methods returned right away on error, even if errno was
          set to EWOULDBLOCK, instead of continuing until all of the data
          was received or sent.

          If the number of bytes received/transfered during the current
          iteration of the loop is zero, then break out of the loop so
          that the actual number of bytes received/transfered is used as
          the return value.  Prior to this change, a value of zero was
          returned, which may not always be the number of bytes
          received/transfered.

Sun Mar 19 23:52:33 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp: Reformatted some code.

Sat Mar 18 20:51:06 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/check_build_logs: added -u option, to provide a
          URL prefix.  If enabled, it will print the URL of
          each log file, prepending the URL prefix.

Sat Mar 18 18:37:19 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Added inclusion of pre.h and post.h.  It got left out
          by the script.  Thanks to Christopher Kohlhoff
          <chris@kohlhoff.com> for noticing this.

Sat Mar 18 05:42:06 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/pre.h:
        * ace/post.h: Added two new file.  <pre.h> preserves the current
          alignment setting of the compiler and <post.h> restores the
          alignment setting.  They are used to make ACE a better team
          player with other library on NT platforms.

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/make_flags.bor: Applied the changes for the
          updated Borland makefiles.

          When using ACE+TAO on Win32 (using either MSVC or BCB) you
          currently must ensure that your application's compiler options
          are set to be the same as those used to build ACE+TAO. For
          example, since ACE+TAO is built using 8-byte alignment, your
          application must also use this alignment otherwise bad things
          can happen.

          Other libraries on Win32 free the developer from this burden by
          explicitly setting these options in the source code. For
          example, the Windows SDK header files contain things like

             #include <pshpack4.h>
             ...
             #include <poppack.h>

          where these header files contain the appropriate #pragmas for
          setting alignment options. (BTW, structure alignment is not the
          only option that may be set, I'm just using it as an
          example. Warnings could be disabled, and - my ulterior motive -
          I have a few problematic BCB compiler options that I would like
          to control.)

          This sort of thing helps a library to play nicely with any other
          libraries or source code someone may be using. It somewhat
          simplifies the instructions for setting up project that uses
          ACE+TAO, and it lets developers change their compiler options
          with abandon without breaking ACE+TAO.

          Thanks to Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for
          providing the patches.

Fri Mar 17 23:28:20 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/OS/Process/process.cpp (tokenize): Fixed a typo in the
          code.  Thanks to Byron Harris <harris_b@ociweb.com> for noticing
          this.

Fri Mar 17 20:43:20 2000  Sangwoo Jin <swjinjin@sei.co.kr>

        * ace/Makefile,Reactor.cpp,Object_Manager.{h,cpp}:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ACE_SVCCONF support.

Fri Mar 17 09:39:52 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Makefile.am: Added ChangeLog-99b to the EXTRA_DIST list.

Fri Mar 17 00:18:40 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/QOS/Sender_QOS_Event_Handler.cpp (handle_qos):
          Make sure to cast the const char* to void* to avoid compiler
          warnings.  Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <rodrigc@mediaone.net> for
          reporting this.

Thu Mar 16 11:51:49 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/MEM_SAP.i:
        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp:

          The ACE_TRACE macros were incompatible with SEH.  Conditionally
          compiled the ACE_TRACE statements in places where this was a
          problem.  Thanks to Edan Ayal <edanayal@yahoo.com> for reporting
          this.

Thu Mar 16 13:40:53 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h: just #define ACE_USES_OLD_IOSTREAMS,
          don't #define it explicitly to 1.  This removes a source
          of confusion:  changing the 1 to 0 didn't disable the feature.
          Thanks to Charles Scott <Charles.P.Scott@jpl.nasa.gov> for
          reporting this.

Thu Mar 16 13:01:02 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Clarified some of the installation instructions for
          building ACE.  Thanks to Jeff Graham <jgraham@lincom-asg.com> for
          contributing these.

        * ace/Event_Handler.h: Clarified the comments for handle_timeout().
          Thanks to Jonathan Reis <reis@stentorsoft.com> for this
          suggestion.

Thu Mar 16 12:47:01 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): check for stacksize <
          ACE_HAS_HUGE_THREAD_STACKSIZE on all platforms,
          not just those with PTHREADS.  Thanks to
          Richard L. Johnson <Richard.L.Johnson@jpl.nasa.gov>
          for reporting this.

Wed Mar 15 23:21:04 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration.cpp: Changed from using ACE_TString::rep() to
          ACE_TString::fast_rep() to avoid memory leaks.  Thanks to for
          reporting this and suggesting the fix.

          Also removed  a call to add_ref() from the constructor of
          ACE_Section_Key_Win32.  It was causing another memory leak.

Wed Mar 15 21:18:19 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU: set
          ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 to 1 for LynxOS 2.5.0, because
          its g++ doesn't support -fno-exceptions.

Wed Mar 15 20:51:21 2000  Chad Elliott <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS.h,ace/ACE.cpp,ace/config-chorus.h,
          include/makeinclude/platform_chorus4.x_g++.GNU:
          added Chorus 4.0 support.

Wed Mar 15 20:47:12 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h: moved #include of OS.h inside the #ifndef ACE_ACE_H
          protection.  OS.h no longer depends on ACE.h, so there's no
          circular include problem.  Thanks to Espen Harlinn
          <espen.harlinn@seamos.no> for reporting this.

Wed Mar 15 20:43:14 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (thr_keycreate): rearranged ::pthread_keycreate ()
          calls so that ACE_HAS_STDARG_THR_DEST is only used with
          ACE_HAS_PTHREADS_DRAFT4.

Wed Mar 15 17:30:57 2000  Balachandran  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.1 released.

Wed Mar 15 15:17:19 2000  Charles Scott <Charles.P.Scott@jpl.nasa.gov>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_ghs.GNU: added
          --stdle --exceptions to CCFLAGS if exceptions are enabled.

Tue Mar 14 15:01:46 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Malloc_Test.cpp: Disable mapping the file into different
          address ranges for HP-UX because the PA-RISC architecture does not
          allow it. See the DEPENDENCIES section of the mmap man page for
          all the details.

Mon Mar 13 22:18:20 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/create_ace_build: default $directory_mode to 0777,
          because it gets modified by the umask anyways.  Thanks
          to Dave Meyer <dmeyer@std.saic.com> for suggesting this.

Mon Mar 13 10:16:53 2000  Bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.16 released.

Sun Mar 12 21:10:13 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * many Makefiles: updated dependencies.

Fri Mar 10 00:17:37 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/ACE-netsvcs.html: Updated this document.  Thanks to
          Charles Meier <cmeier@concentus-tech.com> for contributing this.

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.cpp (ACE_WIN32_Proactor): Replaced
          this->completion_port_ with 0 in the call to
          CreateIoCompletionPort() to make it more clear what's going on.

        * ace/SPIPE_Acceptor.cpp: Very minor reformatting of the code to
          conform to ACE guidelines.

Thu Mar 09 23:12:39 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (flock_init): On Win32, the hEvent in strut overlapped
          should initialized to NULL.  This was causing Naming_Test to
          fail on Windows 2000.  Thanks to <cody.dean@mindspring.com> for
          pointing this out. [Bug 485]

Thu Mar  9 19:49:00 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.h: Clarified that ACE_Reactor::end_event_loop() should
          only be used for the "singleton reactor" and not for user defined
          reactors.  Thanks to Adrian Miranda <ade@psg.com> for motivating
          this.

Thu Mar 09 18:20:00 2000  Angelo Corsaro  <corsaro@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Asynch_IO.h:
        * ace/Asynch_IO_Impl.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.h:
        * ace/Proactor.h:
        * ace/Proactor_Impl.h:
        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:
        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.1.x.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.2.x.h:
        * ace/config-aix-4.3.x.h:

          These files were using the  #if !defined (WHATEVER) as multiple
          inclusion guard instead of  #ifndef WHATEVER. Thanks to Paul
          Calabrese <calabrese_p@ociweb.com> for reporting that.

        * ace/config-visualage.h:
        * ace/CLASSIX/CLASSIX_Port_Default.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:

          While this file were missing multiple inclusion guard. Thanks to
          Paul Calabrese <calabrese_p@ociweb.com> for reporting that.

Thu Mar 09 18:06:52 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Added ACE_HAS_SIGTIMEDWAIT and the
          ACE_PI_CONTROL_BLOCK_ALIGN_LONGS that Nanbor did for
          config-hpux-10.x.h Wed Mar 8. There is still an assert failure
          in Malloc_Test, so something is wrong there.

Thu Mar 09 17:47:41 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Added ACE_HAS_SIGTIMEDWAIT.

Thu Mar 09 17:35:31 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Related to Tue Mar 7 and Wed Mar 8; change the
          static cast to a C-style cast and put in comments explaining that
          depending on the underlying type of thread ID, sometimes a static
          cast is needed, and sometimes a reinterpret cast, so we dropped
          back and punted to a C-style cast. Thanks to Loren Rittle and
          Bala for working this stuff out.

Thu Mar 09 17:01:23 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp (ACE_Name_Options ctor): When allocating
          space for the temp dir path, take the size of a char into account
          to get enough for Unicode characters. Fixes Bugzilla #480.

Thu Mar 09 15:30:41 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h (init, fini): added comments that these methods
          can only be called once per program invocation.  Thanks to
          Chris Hafey <chris@stentorsoft.com> for reporting that an
          init ()/fini ()/init () sequence fails.

Thu Mar 09 12:57:14 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp (main): Fixed several UNICODE
          related problems.  Thanks to Steve H. for reporting this.

Thu Mar  9 09:23:10 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/make_release (create_kit):

          Change to the destination directory prior to invoking `md5sum'
          on the file for which an MD5 checksum is being generated.  This
          was necessary to prevent the absolute path of the file from
          being used as part of the checksum.

          In any case, MD5 checksum generation is now working.  [Bug 48]

          (tag):

          Confirmed that the missing Makefile templates now get installed
          in the ACE betas/releases (no changes, just confirmation).
          [Bug 408]

Thu Mar  9 11:01:34 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Configuration.h: Changed export_config()/import_config() to
          be virtual methods so users can change how the config files are
          implemented.  Thanks to Damien Dufour
          <damien.dufour@horoquartz.fr> for reporting this.

Thu Mar 09 10:41:24 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/NT_Service.(h cpp): Added !defined(ACE_HAS_PHARLAP) to the
          if defined (ACE_HAS_WIN32) to prevent this feature from being
          built on PharLap. Thanks to David Hauck <davidh@realtimeint.com>
          for reporting this and suggesting a fix.

Wed Mar 08 22:19:26 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          moved VxWorks 5.4 (Tornado II) auto detection to
          before CCFLAGS definition, so that it gets set
          properly.  Thanks to Thomas Lockhart
          <Thomas.Lockhart@jpl.nasa.gov> for reporting this. [Bug 481]

Wed Mar  8 19:16:56 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp (main): Added the ASYS_TEXT macro
          to the "ace-malloc-XXXXXX" string to avoid an error when
          compiled with Unicode.  Thanks to Steve Huston
          <shuston@riverace.com> for reporting this.  This fixes BUGID
          479.

Wed Mar  8 19:19:46 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-irix6.x-common.h: Defined ACE_PI_CONTROL_BLOCK_ALIGN_LONGS
          to 2.

Wed Mar  8 15:59:26 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-hpux-10.x.h: Defined ACE_PI_CONTROL_BLOCK_ALIGN_LONGS
          to 2.  The alignment computing macros didn't work in this case.
          Thanks to Steve H. for reporting this.

Wed Mar 08 15:26:31 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace-dll.icc: On AIX, the shared lib is now libACE.o and the
          associated archive is libACE.a. Attempting to unify ACE with the
          screwy way AIX does libraries. When the static library gets built,
          it'll be called libACEns.a.

        * tests/vacpp_setup.icc: On AIX, link libACE.a, not libACEshr.a

        * tests/libDLL_Test.icc: New file to build the library required for
          DLL_Test. Can't be built from DLL_Test.icc because the codestore
          will complain that main() is already defined.

Wed Mar 08 14:46:52 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix4_cset++.GNU: Allow building w/o
          threads by including threads=0 on build command line. Include
          -O2 compile option when optimize=1 is set on build command line.

Wed Mar  8 11:13:04 2000  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Reverted this change.
          Tue Mar  7 14:21:12 CST 2000  Loren Rittle
          <rittle@rsch.comm.mot.com>. The change gave compile errors on
          EGCS.

Wed Mar  8 01:33:21 2000  Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * tests/Makefile.bor: Added new test Process_Manager_Test.

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor, make_flags.bor: Added support
          for BCB's codeguard memory checking tool.

        * include/makeinclude/outputdir.bor: Allow a different directory
          creation tool to be substituted for "mkdir" on Win9x.

Tue Mar 07 18:37:26 2000  Tom Ziomek <tomz@cc701.comm.mot.com>

        * ace/Singleton.h: added comment to ACE_Unmanaged_Singleton
          description to clarify that friend declaration must be
          be for ACE_Unmanaged_Singleton.

Tue Mar  7 14:21:12 CST 2000  Loren Rittle  <rittle@rsch.comm.mot.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Correct cast usage, a reinterpret
          cast was needed.

Tue Mar 07 11:00:10 2000 Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.cpp: Updated the comments
          to make it clear how the ACE_Message_Block buffers are reused.
          Thanks to Dong-Yueh Liu <dyliu@ms1.hinet.net> for suggesting
          this.

Tue Mar 07 10:28:16 2000  bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.15 released.

Mon Mar  6 17:56:56 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/make_release (release_tag_files):

          Added missing declaration of this variable.

Mon Mar  6 13:30:00 2000  Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_tests.vxworks: Removed Cached_Conn_Test from the
          list as this test fails for the current configuration. Until
          researched completely, it has been disabled on vxworks.
          Thanks to David Hall <David.Hall@grc.nasa.gov> for reporting
          this bug.

Sun Mar  5 21:32:45 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          When allocating a new buffer in ACE_CDR::grow() we must leave
          enough room for the buffer required by the user *and* space to
          adjust the alignment.  Thanks to Bala and Jeff for tracking this
          down.

Fri Mar 03 17:01:54 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Malloc_Test.cpp: Changed a couple of straggling
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_MALLOC to
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS.

Fri Mar 03 11:52:10 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.nested.GNU: added -f $(MAKEFILE)
          to $(MAKE) invocation, to support overriding of the default
          Makefile name.  Added definition of MAKEFILE, if it is null.
          Thanks to Wei Chiang <wei.chiang@nokia.com> for suggesting this.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: changed test to see if
          MAKEFILE macro isn't set from ifndef to ifeq null, for consistency
          with above addition to rules.nested.GNU.

Thu Mar  2 13:23:39 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TLI.cpp, TLI_Connector.cpp, TLI_Stream.cpp: Removed comments
          regarding the quality of SunOS 4...  Thanks to Malcolm Spence
          <spence_m@ociweb.com> for reporting this!

Wed Mar  1 22:39:04 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp:

          Thanks to Valery Arkhangorodsky <valerya@servicesoft.com>,
          who took the time to figure out the code in round_up () and
          spotted a mistake in it.

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_persistence.cpp:

          The last bug in my changes.  Changing a pointer to an array
          is not something to be done on a whim.  Needed to change a
          couple of "== 0" to strcpy's, etc.

Wed Mar 01 19:25:39 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Based_Pointer_T.cpp:
        * ace/Malloc.cpp: Replaced ACE_ASSERT (!"A STRING") with
          ACE_ASSERT (0).  Some brain-damaged compilers (i.e., Diab DCC
          4.2b) can't handle this.  Thanks to Bob Bouterse
          <BBouterse@escient.com> for reporting and fixing this.

Wed Mar  1 16:29:55 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * configure.in (ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID):

          Wrapped the test for this macro with
          ACE_CONVERT_WARNINGS_TO_ERRORS to cause implicit prototype
          declaration warnings to be converted to errors when using
          gcc < 2.95.2 (including egcs <= 1.1.x).  This fixes a warning on
          Red Hat 6.1 systems.  Thanks to Rich Seibel
          <seibel_r@ociweb.com> for providing a fix.

Tue Feb 29 23:36:29 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/README:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.h:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.i:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (append_thr): Moved thread descriptor
          reset statement into reset.

          (reset): Added reset methods to
          ACE_Thread_Descriptor and ACE_Thread_Descriptor_Base to reset
          Thread_Descriptor back to its initialized state.

          (ACE_Thread_Descriptor): Removed reset statements for
          cleanup_info_.  They are handle by ACE_Cleanup_Info's contructor
          already.

          (acquire_release): Added a macro
          ACE_THREAD_MANAGER_USES_SAFE_SPAWN to disable double-checked
          locking.  When this macro is defined, a spawned thread will
          always acquire the release the <sync_> lock before starting any
          other initialization.  This should avoid a potential race
          condition on some platforms (i.e., DEC Alpha, Marced) using
          aggressive read/write reordering strategies.

          (spawn_i): Call <reset> method on the "new" thread descriptor
          after acquiring a thread descriptor from the freelist.  This
          change moved most of the thread descriptor initialization code
          from append_thr into <reset>, before spawning the thread.

          Thanks to John Hickin <hickin@nortelnetworks.com> for motivating
          these changes.

Tue Feb 29 21:18:12 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          One more warning cleaned up from my get_temp_dir () change.
          Hopefully the last (crossing my fingers).

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:

          Missing some header files, thanks to Andres Kruse
          <andres.kruse@creaturelabs.com> for noticing.

        * ace/OS.h:

          Even when ACE_HAS_WIN32_STRUCTURAL_EXCEPTIONS was not defined,
          ACE_SEH_TRY and family was still being defined to the seh
          commands (like __try) on Win32.  When the above macro is not
          defined, they are now noops.  Thanks to Natarajan Kalpathy
          <Natarajan_Kalpathy@mw.3com.com> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 29 16:40:43 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          Fixed alignment problems when inserting message blocks without
          copying.  The same fix was a good excuse to optimize the
          OutputCDR class, as described in bug #160.

        * ace/OS.h:
          Use the ACE_ prefix in a couple of naked macros.

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
          Fixed the crc32 routine, it seems we inherited a bug from the
          FreeBSD code.  Thanks to Jonathan Reis <reis@stentorsoft.com>
          for finding the bug and providing a patch for it.

Tue Feb 29 16:23:41 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Handle_Set.h: Added some explanation to a few ACE_Handle_Set
          member functions to clarify their purpose and use.

Tue Feb 29 13:48:24 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Updated a comment about using ACE_Malloc for class-specific
          allocations.  Thanks to Boris Sukholitko <boris@webglide.com>
          for reporting this.

Tue Feb 29 08:48:28 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp:  Enabled the test on Win32 and removed
          a use of ACE_DEFAULT_BACKING_STORE.

Tue Feb 29 08:56:51 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          reverted this change:

          Mon Feb 28 20:42:17 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

          because it caused static constructors not to be called.
          Thanks to Elias Sreih <sealstd1@nortelnetworks.com> for
          reporting this.

Mon Feb 28 20:04:23 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp:  Missed a semicolon.

Mon Feb 28 20:42:17 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          with Tornado 2 (VxWorks 5.4) and later, use
          ld$(TOOLENV) instead of ace_ld.  Apparently, munch
          is no longer required.  Thanks to Elias Sreih
          <sealstd1@nortelnetworks.com> for reporting that
          ace_ld/munch caused undefined symbols for calls to
          global ctors with Tornado 2.

Mon Feb 28 17:34:00 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          The Unix and Win32 behavior for get_temp_dir () wasn't consistent.
          Now both will return -1 if there is any problem such as the buffer
          not being long enough.

Mon Feb 28 09:20:27 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added get_temp_dir () method that fills a buffer with the path
          for the temporary directory.  ACE has previously hardcoded the
          path.  The right way is to find the path at runtime, especially on
          Win32 where the TEMP directory can be different from machine to
          machine (or even different for each user).

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/FILE_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/Memory_Pool.cpp:
        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:
        * ace/Naming_Context.h:
        * ace/System_Time.cpp:
        * ace/System_Time.h:
        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_persistence.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Logging_Strategy.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Logging_Strategy.h:
        * netsvcs/lib/TS_Clerk_Handler.cpp:
        * tests/Time_Service_Test.cpp:

          Removed the macro definitions that used C:\\temp:
          ACE_DEFAULT_BACKING_STORE
          ACE_DEFAULT_TEMP_FILE
          ACE_DEFAULT_LOGFILE
          ACE_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE

          The default path in these cases are now found by using the
          ACE::get_temp_dir method.  The macros are still supported in
          that they can still be used to override the default case.

        * tests/test_config.h:
        * tests/MM_Shared_Memory_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Mem_Map_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.h:

          Removed the macro definitions for:
          ACE_DEFAULT_TEST_FILE
          ACE_TEMP_FILE_NAME
          ACE_LOG_DIRECTORY

          and replaced with ACE::get_temp_dir.

          Also changed the default log file directory on Win32 to be in
          the log subdirectory.  So now both Unix and NT have the same
          behavior, the logs will be written to $ACE_ROOT/tests/log.

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.res:  (removed)

          This file was giving me warnings when I built, and since it
          should be generated from the .rc file, I don't think it should
          be in the repository.

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.dsp:  (added)
        * tests/version_tests/Process_Manager_Test.dsp:  (added)
        * tests/tests.dsw:
        * tests/version_tests/version_tests.dsw:

          Enabled the Process_Manager_Test on NT and created a MSVC
          workspace for it.  Also fixed some miscellaneous UNICODE issues.

        * tests/run_tests.bat:

          Added the Process_Manager_Test and changed the location of the
          log files.

        * tests/README:

          Changed the location of the output of the log files.

Mon Feb 28 09:16:40 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Local_Tokens.cpp (ACE_TPQ_Entry):

          Removed cast of ACE_thread_t to long unsigned int since some
          platforms (e.g. HPUX) declare the underlying thread type as a
          structure.  This change reverts back to the version prior to
          Steve's change.

Mon Feb 28 08:33:43 2000  Zoran Ivanovic <Zoran_Ivanovic@i2.com>

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html: fixed typo, in example
          #include directive (Foo_T.i instead of Active_Map_Manager_T.i).

Sun Feb 27 16:20:43 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.h: Made the ACE_TSS_Type_Adapter operator TYPE() a const
          to avoid overloading ambiguities.  Thanks to Bruce McIntosh
          <Bruce.McIntosh@australia.boeing.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.h: Improved the comments.

Sat Feb 26 19:52:01 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          The grow() function was re-allocating the buffer even when there
          was just enough memory, i.e. this was an off-by-one error, in
          the form of a < instead of <= comparison.  When it finally
          decided to grow the buffer it was using the global heap instead
          of the allocators in the message block, which may be more
          efficient.

Sat Feb 26 19:47:05 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Local_Tokens.cpp (ACE_TPQ_Entry):

          Needed to go a step further.  Taking the jackhammer approach by
          switching to a C style cast until a better solution presents
          itself.

Sat Feb 26 13:40:57 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Local_Tokens.cpp (ACE_TPQ_Entry):

          Compaq C++ doesn't like the static cast from ACE_thread_t to
          long unsigned int.  Take the sledgehammer approach and use a
          reinterpret cast instead.

Sat Feb 26 13:20:13 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (INADDR_LOOPBACK):

          Define this macro to hexidecimal value of the loopback address
          127.0.0.1 (0x7f000001).  LynxOS doesn't define this constant.

Fri Feb 25 16:50:37 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Profile_Timer.cpp (ACE_Profile_Timer ctor):
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (format_msg):
        * ace/Local_Tokens.cpp (ACE_TPQ_Entry::ACE_TPQ_Entry):
          Fixed to avoid a gcc 2.95 warning about mismatch format/arg types.

Fri Feb 25 14:56:41 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_vacpp.GNU: New file for use
          with Visual Age C++ on AIX. It isn't really needed for much at this
          point except building the tests via Makefile. If you like doing
          everything directly with vacbld without the aid of ACE's make
          scheme, you don't need to use this.

Fri Feb 25 14:48:31 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU: Add a rule to build a binary
          based on a Visual Age C++ configuration (.icc file) and sources.
          This allows building using Makefile, but defers all the real work
          to Visual Age C++ builder (vacbld). Useful for building the ACE
          tests especially.

Fri Feb 25 14:44:37 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Add *.ics to files deleted
          in cleanup. This cleans up Visual Age C++ codestores.

Fri Feb 25 13:06:14 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_{ghs,g++}.GNU:
          updated platform information to reflect that these
          files are intended for VxWorks 5.3.1 and later.

Fri Feb 25 13:03:35 2000  Fernando D. Mato Mira  <matomira@iname.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_{diab,g++}.GNU:
          added PPC603 support.

Fri Feb 25 10:47:33 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h,
        * ace/config-win32-borland.h: Added ACE_INT64_FORMAT_SPECIFIER
          for both platforms.  Thanks to Christopher
          Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for providing the fix.

Thu Feb 24 15:55:16 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp: Added "&& defined (_WINDOWS)" to all the places
          where memory alloc sizes had been faked out on conditionals selecting
          Visual Age C++. The reported issues that originated the conditions
          are not problems for AIX; with the conditional code in, tests
          failed due to memory corruptions.

Thu Feb 24 15:44:42 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Thu Feb 24 12:15:46 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/makeicc.pl: Corrected to write Id variable in new .icc

Thu Feb 24 01:52:51 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (append_thr): Moved the setting of
          THR_SPAWNED state down to right before releasing the thread
          creation lock.  Hopefully, this will eliminate a warning about a
          non-existing race condition from KAI Assure.  Thanks to John

Wed Feb 23 23:52:15 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h: Added a hack to work around nasty libraries

Wed Feb 23 19:37:29 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/Synch.i (lock): Make sure that ACE_File_Lock::set_handle()
          sets this->removed_ = 0.  Thanks to Sanwoo Jin
          <swjinjin@sei.co.kr> for reporting this.

        * tests/FlReactor_Test.cpp (main): Minor reformatting.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h: When you define _DEBUG the orbsvcs
          dll exports all "inline" functions, and this seems to be too
          much for BCB4 linker.  Thaddeus L. Olczyk
          <olczyk@interaccess.com> reported this problem and Christopher
          Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> provided the fix.

        * ace/OS,
          ace/Synch: Added a new parameter to flock_destroy() and
          ACE_File_Lock::remove() that controls whether the lockfile is
          removed when the filelock is destroyed.  By default, this is
          "enabled" so the existing semantics don't change.  Thanks to
          Sanwoo Jin <swjinjin@sei.co.kr> for suggesting this.

Wed Feb 23 17:02:34 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/vacpp_setup.icc: Settings for Visual Age C++ which are included
          in the individual tests' VAC++ configurations. Captures all of the
          platform (AIX vs. NT) differences in one place.

        * tests/makeicc.pl: Changed to generate .icc files that work on either
          NT or AIX, using the above vacpp_setup.icc.

Wed Feb 23 16:54:31 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Based_Pointer_Repository.cpp (ACE_Based_Pointer_Repository_Rep):
          Moved typedefs for MAP_MANAGER, MAP_ITERATOR, MAP_ENTRY inside
          the class definition so they don't conflict with other types of
          the same name (Visual Age C++ sees all of them at once, even if
          other compilers may never see those two definitions in the same
          compilation unit ever).

Wed Feb 23 14:48:52 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace-dll.icc: Platform-specifics further segmented out to make
          Visual Age C++ builds work for both NT and AIX. Removed Multiplexor.h
          and Multiplexor.cpp since those files are not used. Added
          Based_Pointer_Repository.(cpp h).

        * ace/OS.i (getpwnam_r): Add a condition for the Visual Age C++ on
          AIX compiler - it can't correctly handle the ::getpwnam_r call.

Wed Feb 23 14:45:21 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:
        * tests/Dynamic_Priority_Test.cpp:
          Fixed warnings when compiling without
          ACE_HAS_TIMED_MESSAGE_BLOCKS defined.

Wed Feb 23 12:19:51 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTOTYPE,
                    ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTOTYPE):

          If either _BSD_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENEDED
          is defined then do not allow the prototypes corresponding to
          these macros to become visible since defining any of these
          macros may make the real prototypes in the system headers
          visible.  Thanks to Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com> for
          pointing this out.

Tue Feb 22 21:11:03 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * configure.in (ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR):

          Added test for wcslen().  Only define this macro if both the
          wchar_t type and the wcslen() function exist.  This fixes a link
          problem on a ACE+autoconf QNX build.

Tue Feb 22 20:56:51 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * config.guess:

          Updated to latest version from the GNU CVS repository.

        * config.sub:

          Merged my QNX Neutrino patches into the latest version from the
          GNU CVS repository.

Tue Feb 22 20:09:14 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * config.sub:

          Added support for QNX Neutrino.  Hosts specifications such as
          "i386-nto," "i386-qnx," "i386-qnx-nto," etc, will now be
          accepted by the configure script's "--host" command line
          option.  A patch has been sent to the upstream maintainers of
          this script.

        * ace/OS.cpp (unique_name):

          Fixed warning about mismatched format specifier by explicitly
          casting the result of ACE_OS::getpid(), a "pid_t," to an "int."

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_LOFF_T):

          QNX Nuetrino has a 64-bit offset type, "off64_t."

        * m4/platform.m4 (ACE_SET_PLATFORM_MACROS):

          Added support for QNX Neutrino.

Tue Feb 22 17:42:09 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch.cpp: Reset the ACE_File_Lock::remove_ data member to
          0 in the open() method so that it can be reused.  Thanks to
          Sanwoo Jin <swjinjin@sei.co.kr> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 22 13:57:32 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (send_n and recv_n): Reduced the number of calls to
          message_block->length () by caching the value.  Also inlined
          some of the smaller functions.

Tue Feb 22 12:29:44 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * m4/threads.m4 (ACE_CHECK_THREAD_FLAGS):

          Added run-time tests to this M4 macro to get around the annoying
          fact that some platforms implement no-op thread function stubs,
          which cause link-time tests to pass.  The run-time tests check
          the return value of pthread_create() and/or thr_create() to
          determine if the function is working or not.  The cross-compiled
          case falls back on the link-time test.  This fixes a problem on
          Solaris with both Sun C++ and g++.

Tue Feb 22 14:00:38 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (cond_timedwait): added pSOS support.  Thanks
          to Sarmeesha Reddy <sarmeesha@bigfoot.com> for the
          implementation.

Tue Feb 22 09:52:50 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h (ACE_HAS_PROC_FS):

          A conflict appears when including both <ucontext.h> and
          <sys/procfs.h> with recent glibc headers, so don't define it.
          However, at some point we should redefine this macro since the
          latest glibc fixes this problem.

Tue Feb 22 09:16:29 2000  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/streams.h: Commented out an inclusion of the file
          <iomanip.h> as this was causing problems with Qt.

        * ace/Signal.h: One of the variables for the constructors of
          ACE_Sig_Action  was named as "signals". This apparently causes
          conflict with the Qt library as the library has a macro by that
          name. So it was changed as "signalss". Thanks to James Briggs
          <James.Briggs@dsto.defence.gov.au> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 22 01:52:09 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp: Refactored the code in duplicate()
          and clone() so that it doesn't have macro within macros.
          Thanks to Nanbor for reporting this.

Tue Feb 22 01:19:40 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_IO.h: Added more comments.

Tue Feb 22 00:39:03 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_IO.h: Changed method fetch_recv_buf as protected and
          added some missing comments.

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.h:
        * ace/MEM_Connector.h: Added some missing comments.

Mon Feb 21 20:40:37 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_*: Minor modifications to formatting here.

        * tests/Dynamic_Priority_Test.cpp: Only run this test if
          ACE_HAS_TIMED_MESSAGE_BLOCKS is enabled.

        * ace/Message_Block: By default, the deadline_time_ and execution_time_
          data members are now omitted and their accessor/mutator
          operations rendered "no-op"s unless ACE_HAS_TIMED_MESSAGE_BLOCKS
          is enabled.  This is necessary to avoid an unnecessary 16 bytes
          per-Message_Block.  Thanks to Irfan for pointing this out.

Mon Feb 21 17:22:33 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * configure.in (ACE_LACKS_SETREUID):

          Fixed typo.

          (ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_MSG_NAME):

          Fixed broken test.  A `struct sockaddr' was being cast to a
          `struct sockaddr *', which is obviously broken.  This fix has
          the side effect of causing ACE_HAS_SOCKADDR_MSG_NAME to be
          defined on platforms where the "msg_name" field of the "msghdr"
          structure is a `void*', such as Linux and Solaris.  This isn't
          necessarily a bad thing since it is perfectly valid.

          (ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_SOCKOPT, ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SOCKOPT):

          Fixed the tests for these two macros.  The fifth "optlen"
          argument to setsockopt() was being passed in as a pointer to
          some integral type.  The "optlen" argument to setsockopt() is
          not a pointer.  Rather, it should be one of the following:
          socklen_t, size_t or int.  The appropriate type for "optlen"
          will be determined from previous tests, such as the test for
          socklen_t.

          The test for ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SOCKOPT will now only be run if the
          test for ACE_HAS_VOIDPTR_SOCKOPT fails.

Mon Feb 21 16:23:03 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        Thanks to Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com> for providing the
        highly detailed feedback that led to the following changes/fixes:

        * THANKS:

          Added Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com> to the list of
          contributors.

        * acconfig.h (ACE_HAS_IOMANIP_NO_H):

          Removed this macro since it isn't used anywhere.

          (ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTO, ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTO):

          These should have been ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTOTYPE, and
          ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTOTYPE, respectively.

        * configure.in (ACE_HAS_IOMANIP_NO_H):

          Removed the test for this macro.  It isn't used anywhere.

          (ACE_HAS_SIZET_SOCKET_LEN):

          Only test for this macro if ACE_HAS_SOCKLEN_T isn't defined.

          (ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTO, ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTO):

          These should have been ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTOTYPE, and
          ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTOTYPE, respectively.

          Added "-U_BSD_SOURCE" to list of macros to undefine for each of
          the tests for these macros.  Defining "_BSD_SOURCE" on some
          platforms may make the prototypes corresponding to the above
          macros visible, so we need to explicitly undefine it.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h (ACE_HAS_PROCFS):

          Corrected typo.  This macro should have been ACE_HAS_PROC_FS.

Mon Feb 21 16:19:36 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Protect the definitions of the CDR macros, so users can override
          them in their config.h file.  Thanks to Jim Scheller
          <csoftware@iname.com> for pointing this out.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.i:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          Fixed the algorithm to allocate new CDR blocks in the chain.  In
          all but a few weird cases it was allocating fixed sized blocks,
          while the intention was to grow the size of the blocks to
          minimize the number of allocations.  Thanks to Jim Scheller
          <csoftware@iname.com> for finding this problem.
          Also added a new ACE_CDR::consolidate() method to reduce a
          message block chain into a single message block (with proper
          alignment).  This is useful in the implementation of the CDR
          streams and Anys.

Mon Feb 21 14:35:39 2000 Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ace/Makefile.bor: Added new files.

        * tests/*.cpp, tests/test_config.h: Removed macros that had been
          used by C++Builder 3.

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor: Added support for C++Builder 5
          VCL libs.

        * include/makeinclude/recurse.bor, lots of Makefile.bor files:
          Added support for makefile recursion.

Mon Feb 21 14:35:39 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor: Increased the limit of
          LIB_LFLAGS from 2048 to 4096.  Thanks to Mogens Hansen
          <mogens_h@dk-online.dk> for reporting this.

Mon Feb 21 15:43:01 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_SAP.h:
        * ace/MEM_SAP.cpp (create_shm_malloc): Renamed the typedef
          <MALLOC> to <MALLOC_TYPE> to avoid name clashing problem on GHS
          cross compilers.  Thanks to Bill Tovrea
          <gwtovrea@west.raytheon.com> for reporting this and the help in
          tracking this down.

Mon Feb 21 12:51:52 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * Makefile (RELEASE_TAG_FILES):

          Added `man/Makefile.am' to the list of files to be tagged at
          release time.

Mon Feb 21 08:35:58 2000  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h
          Corrected a build problem with KCC.  Things were lost in the
          transition to the new header file.

Sun Feb 20 18:31:46 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace: Removed ACED.cpp and ACER.cpp.  These were only
          needed by Borland C++Builder 3.0, which is not supported by ACE
          (i.e., you need to upgrade to BCB 4.0 or later).  Thanks to
          Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for this fix.

Sun Feb 20 23:43:22 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:
          Changed Base_Pointer_T.cpp to Based_Pointer_T.cpp.
          Also synced ace_lib with ace_dll to bring up to date.

Sun Feb 20 11:33:09 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Todd Gruhn <tgruhn2@mail.com> to the list of
          contributors.

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Defined ACE_HAS_DIRENT, and undefined ACE_LACKS_SIGSET.  Thanks
          to Todd Gruhn <tgruhn2@mail.com> for confirming that these
          changes were necessary.

Sat Feb 19 17:53:47 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/make_release (create_kit):

          Another attempt to fix MD5 checksum generation at release time:
          The problem was that an attempt to get the MD5 checksum for a
          file in the current directory was being made, but that file had
          already been moved to the destination FTP directory.  Prepending
          the destination directory to the filename should correct the
          problem.  MD5 checksum generation has been re-enabled.

Sat Feb 19 17:32:28 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * Makefile (RELEASE_TAG_FILES):

          Added this new variable.  It contains a list of files that
          should be tagged at release time, but shouldn't be listed in any
          of the release/controlled file lists.  This is necessary to
          prevent multiple instances of the same file from being passed to
          the `.zip' file creation command line.  For example,
          ACE_wrappers/man, ACE_wrappers/man/man3/Makefile.am and
          ACE_wrappers/man/html/Makefile.am were all being passed to the
          `.zip' file creation command line, resulting in duplicate file
          names on that command line.  Thanks to David for pointing this
          out.

          The `bin/make_release' script will use this new list of files
          when tagging a release.

          (show_release_tag_files):

          Makefile target that lists files that should be tagged at
          release time.

        * bin/make_release:

          Invoke "$make show_release_tag_files" to determine if there are
          any additional files to tag at release time.

          (tag):

          Added "$release_tag_files" to list of files to be tagged by CVS
          at release time.  This fixes a problem where the man page
          Makefile.am files were not being tagged, which also prevented
          them from being distributed with the ACE distribution. [Bug 408]

Sat Feb 19 15:33:05 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.14 released.

Fri Feb 18 20:58:08 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile:
          Do not send email if the build completed without errors.

Fri Feb 18 17:30:26 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: Filled out with the known compiler settings
          for g++, KCC, HP CC, and HP aC++. This is now the official HP-UX 11
          config.h file for all compilers.

        * ace/config-hpux-11.x-hpc++.h: This file is no longer in use. It
          generates a compiler error if used. It is planned to go away
          for ACE 5.1.

Fri Feb 18 10:25:45 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Workaround MSVC5 bug when invoking explicit destructors. Thanks
          to Achim Stindt <stindt@conbis.de> for this fix.

Thu Feb 17 18:32:05 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * OS.h:
          Removed the ACE_GLOBAL_COLONS macro I added yesterday.
          Found another way to generate code with the IDL compiler
          that doesn't need it.

Thu Feb 17 09:38:06 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Reader_Writer_Test.cpp: use default n_iterations
          of 25 and n_loops of 10 on VxWorks.  With the old defaults,
          the test took too long, e.g., 7 minutes on a 450 MHz
          Pentium.  With the new defaults, it takes about 20 seconds.
          Thanks to Dave Hall <David.Hall@grc.nasa.gov> for reporting this.

Thu Feb 17 08:10:08 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (close_singletons): Don't bother calling
          ACE_Proactor::close_singleton() on WinCE, Win95/98, or if
          these's no support for AIO calls.  Thanks to Sanwoo Jin
          <swjinjin@sei.co.kr> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 16 17:03:31 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/version_tests/version_tests.dsw: Add Capabilities_Test.dsp.

Wed Feb 16 14:53:05 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:
          Added ACE_GLOBAL_COLONS macro. In certain cases in IDL files
          where nested scoped names repeat (after skipping a scope so
          it's legal), all comilers except SucCC 5.0 need the fully
          scoped name with the global double colon in order to resolve
          the name. SunCC 5.0, on the other hand, not only doesn't
          need it, but outputs an error whenever it sees these global
          double colons just inside an open paranthesis, for example,
          (::foo::...). This macro is used in generating code in
          just these instances so all comilers can be happy.

Tue Feb 15 22:57:59 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_IO.h:
        * ace/MEM_IO.cpp (send): Added a new method that sends a chain of
          Message_Block.  This function aggregates the data in
          Message_Block and copies them directly into shared memory.

Tue Feb 15 21:26:00 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/FD-unserver.cpp,CPP-unserver.cpp (main),
          examples/Reactor/Multicast/server.cpp (main),
          examples/System_V_IPC/SV_Message_Queues/MQ_Server.cpp (main),
          examples/System_V_IPC/SV_Message_Queues/TMQ_Server.cpp (main),
          wrapped final return with ACE_NOTREACHED to please cxx T6.3-003.

Mon Feb 14 16:52:24 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_cxx.GNU:
          no longer need to explicitly link all of the
          template instantiation files into shared libs.
          -shared works properly with T6.3-003.

Mon Feb 14 12:21:01 2000  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.x-hpc++.h

          Added a conditional include for the KCC common include file.
          Modified the values of ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS and
          ACE_LACKS_LINEBUFFERED_STREAMBUF to match those of the KCC
          common header.  This will not affect non-KCC builds on HP.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_kcc.GNU

          Added this file for building on HPUX with KCC.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_kcc.GNU

          Modified to allow building static libraries.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_kcc.GNU

          Modified to allow building static libraries.

Mon Feb 14 08:43:31 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * acconfig.h:

          Changed ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_MALLOC macro to
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS since the name changed in
          ACE as well.

        * configure.in (AC_LANG_CPLUSPLUS):

          Set the test language to C++ earlier in the configure script to
          make sure all tests are done using the C++ compiler.

          (ACE_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS, ACE_COMPILATION_OPTIONS):

          Moved configure script option macros to new `m4/ace.m4' M4
          macros file.

          (ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE,
           ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION,
           ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_PRAGMA):

          Overhauled the tests for these macros.  Since there may be a
          tight dependency between some of these macros, the
          ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE test also tests if either of the
          other two macros are required.  This fixes a problem that was
          occurring with Sun C++ 5.0.

          Corrected a syntax error in the previous
          ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_PRAGMA test, which is now part of
          the ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE test.

          (ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_PRAGMA):

          Added a test for this macro.  It is only run if the
          ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE test failed.  This should improve
          AIX support.

        * m4/ace.m4 (ACE_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS, ACE_COMPILATION_OPTIONS):

          Moved all configure script command line option macros to this
          file and placed them in the above M4 macros.  This makes things
          a bit cleaner, and it also allows other macros to AC_REQUIRE the
          above macros.

        * m4/compiler.m4 (ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS):

          Made this macro depend on ACE_COMPILATION_OPTIONS
          (i.e. AC_REQUIRE it).

          Moved more compiler specific variable settings from configure.in
          to this macro.

Sat Feb 12 20:35:23 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_position_independent_malloc.cpp (initialize):
          Zapped several temporary variables that were causing warnings
          when ACE_ASSERT is disabled.  Thanks to David Levine for
          reporting this.

Sat Feb 12 17:06:20 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp (ACE_Thread_Exit): Removed member
          <status_> and its accessors.  They don't seem to be used
          anywhere in ACE and can't be accessed by users.  Thanks to
          "Elias Sreih" <sealstd1@nortelnetworks.com> for noticing this.

Sat Feb 12 15:15:01 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/README (ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS): Renamed
          the depricated ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_MALLOC to
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS.

        * ace/OS.h: Made ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS=1 the default
          if it is not defined already.  If you don't want the support of
          position independent pointers (which means you don't care about
          position independent malloc,)  define
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_POINTERS to 0.

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:
        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Removed depricated
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_MALLOC.

          examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp,
          examples/Logger/simple-server/Logging_Handler.cpp (handle_timeout):
          added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (arg), only with ACE_NDEBUG.

Sat Feb 12 00:27:45 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Changed to conditionally define
          ACE_DEFAULT_TEMP_DIR_ENV according to whether the unicode is
          supported or not.

        * ace/MEM_SAP.h:
        * ace/MEM_SAP.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.cpp (accept):

Fri Feb 11 13:26:49 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.cpp (accept): Changed to use
          ACE_reinterpret_cast to cast (sockaddr *) to (sockaddr_in *).
          This eliminate the warning on HPUX aCC compiler.

Fri Feb 11 01:16:15 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.h: Changed to use ACE_LACKS_INLINE_FUNCTIONS to
          determine where to include MEM_Acceptor.i file as ASYS_INLINE is
          used.  Thanks to Marina and SunCC 5 for reporting the problem.

Thu Feb 10 21:57:04 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_SAP.h
        * ace/MEM_SAP.i (set_buf_len): Removed the const'ness of argument
          <buf>.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp: Added MEM_* files.

Thu Feb 10 13:49:34 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/MEM_SAP.h:
        * ace/MEM_SAP.i:
        * ace/MEM_SAP.cpp: Implemented the adaptation layer for managing
          shared memory in shared memory transport.

        * ace/MEM_Addr.h:
        * ace/MEM_Addr.i:
        * ace/MEM_Addr.cpp: Implemented the "endpoint" addressing
          mechanism for shared memory transport.  The ACE_MEM_Addr make
          sure the "endpoint" is not on an interface that is accessable
          outside of the running host.  It also serves as endpoint
          identification and provides the <same_host> checking method.

        * ace/MEM_IO.h:
        * ace/MEM_IO.i:
        * ace/MEM_IO.cpp: Implemented the IO routines for shared memory
          transport.  Currently, these IO routines treat shared memory
          transport as a streaming devide and copy the data into its own
          buffer before sending the data over.  We'll add method for
          acquiring and sending the internal buffer later.

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.h:
        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.i:
        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_Connector.h:
        * ace/MEM_Connector.i:
        * ace/MEM_Connector.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_Stream.h:
        * ace/MEM_Stream.i:
        * ace/MEM_Stream.cpp: These classes emulate SOCK_* classes but use
          shared memory as their transport mechanism.

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp: Fixed a mis-matched ACE_TRACE message.

        * ace/OS.h: Added definitions of ACE_MEM_ACCEPTOR,
          ACE_MEM_CONNECTOR and, ACE_MEM_STREAM.

        * ace/Makefile: Aded MEM_* files and updated dependencies.

        * tests/Malloc_Test.cpp: Removed explicit template instantiations
          for ACE_Malloc[_T] as they are taken care of in MEM_SAP.cpp
          now.

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP-memclient.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP-memserver.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP_memclient.dsp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP_memserver.dsp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/SOCK_SAP.dsw: Added a simple example
          on how to use the shared-memory transport.

        * THANKS:

          Added Hajdukiewicz Markus <MHajdukiewic@heyde.de> and Gerwin
          Robert <RGerwin@heyde.de> to the list of fame.

        * configure.in (ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED):

          Fixed test so that it defines ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED when
          sched_setscheduler() isn't found.  This was the intended
          behavior.  Thanks to Hajdukiewicz Markus <MHajdukiewic@heyde.de>
          and Gerwin Robert <RGerwin@heyde.de> for providing a patch for
          this problem.

          (ace_cv_feature_cxx_std_template_specialization):

          It appears that this variable had to be quoted when testing if
          it was set to "yes" on AIX.  Thanks again to Markus and Robert
          for providing a patch.

Wed Feb 09 00:41:36 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp (main): Spawn command should be
          "./Pipe_Test" and not "Pipe_Test".  Otherwise the test will fail
          if the user does not have "." in his/her PATH.  Thanks to Ossama
          for reporting this problem.

Tue Feb 08 21:22:45 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Token: Yesterday's change caused one problem.  There was no
          way to distinguish which thread was going to be the next owner.
          So the following happened:

          Thread A had a read lock and was waiting in select().  Thread B
          wanted a write lock, therefore it executed the sleep hook, and
          then waited on the condition.  Thread A got up through the sleep
          hook, signaled thread B, released the lock and went back to grab
          the read lock.  Even though thread B was runnable, it hadn't
          gotten a chance to become the owner and <in_use_> was still
          zero.  When thread A tried to reacquire the read lock, it
          succeeded.  Thread B finally ran to find out that the token was
          in use and went back to sleep, and hence got starved in the
          process.

          Therefore, the following changes were made to fix the above:

          - wakeup_next_waiter() always reset <in_use_> and <owner_>.  If
            there is a waiter, it sets <in_use_> and <owner_> for the next
            owner.

          - release() doesn't reset <in_use_> and <owner_> since
            wakeup_next_waiter() now does.

          - renew() doesn't set or reset <in_use_> and <owner_> since
            wakeup_next_waiter() now does.

          - shared_acquire() doesn't set <in_use_> and <owner_> since
            wakeup_next_waiter() now does.

          - The while loops in shared_acquire() and renew() now loop until
            the calling thread becomes the owner.

          Note that this version of the Token implementation is still
          better than the previous one since it does not double delete on
          timeouts and wakes up the next waiter if it timed out and became
          the owner simultaneously.

Tue Feb 08 21:46:51 2000  Girish Birajdar  <birajdar@lucent.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU:
          added SIMSPARCSOLARIS support.

          Updated from latest libtool multi-language branch versions.

Tue Feb  8 14:25:46 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h (ACE_HAS_TYPENAME_KEYWORD):

          According to ACE's configure script, Sun C++ 5.0 also supports
          the typename keyword.

Tue Feb  8 16:17:21 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.h: Added comment text to ACE_Thread_Manager::wait
          noting that it doesn't wait during ACE_Object_Manager rundown.

Tue Feb  8 14:16:50 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h (ACE_HAS_USING_KEYWORD):

          Sun C++ 5.0 supports the `using' keyword.  Thanks to David Wicks
          <wicks@swbell.net> for pointing this out.

Mon Feb 07 21:11:32 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Token: Bug 416
          (http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=416) was causing
          problems for TAO/tests/Leader_Followers.  The current owner of
          the token was in the process of waking up the next thread. In
          the meantime, the thread that was going to be woken up next
          timed out.  This lead to double deletes from queues and double
          decrements of counters: one by the thread doing the signaling
          and the other by the thread timing out. In addition, the other
          threads waiting for token never woke up since there was nobody
          to wake them up.

          The following changes were made to rectify this problem:

          - ACE_Token::ACE_Token_Queue::insert_entry() factored out common
            code for adding followers to the queue.

          - The thread adding itself to the waiter queue and changing the
            counters is the one responsible for undoing the state
            changes.  The thread doing to wake up is only responsible for
            the signaling.

          - When a thread timeouts, it must check if it was also selected
            as the next owner.  If it was, it must wakeup another waiter.

          - renew() was simplified and made consistent with
            shared_acquire() and release().

          - wakeup_next_waiter() abstracted out the code for the selection
            of the next owner.

          - Improved state management including values for <this->owner_>
            and <this->in_use_>.

          - The wait() loop was not correct. We now loop until the token
            is no longer in use.  This way if the token ownership was taken
            by another (new) waiter thread by the time we wake up, we simply
            go back to sleep.

Mon Feb  7 17:54:06 2000  Jeff Parsons  <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/run_all_list.pm:
          Added TAO/tests/DynAny_Test/run_test.pl to the general
          and single-threaded test groups.

Mon Feb  7 17:30:00 2000  Kirthika Parameswaran  <kirthika@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (out_of_handles): Added ENOTSUP (Operation not
          supported) check for SunOS. This helped in solving a bug when
          the Cached_Conn_Test was executed using a single-threaded build.
          Thanks to Steve Huston <shuston@riverace.com> for reporting this
          bug.

Mon Feb  7 17:28:40 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/main.cpp (main): Removed two
          warnings that crept in recently.  Thanks to David Levine
          for reporting this.

Mon Feb  7 08:34:26 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * docs/ACE-subsets.html:
          Removed the instructions for subsets on Win32. Subsets are not
          supported under MSVC Project files.

Sun Feb  6 20:44:26 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace-config.1.in:

          Updated e-mail address of author (me).

        * configure.in:

          Updated e-mail address of configure script maintainer (me again).

          (PURE_CACHE_DIR):

          Fixed syntax of shell script variables.  This fixes a problem
          that occurred on FreeBSD.

          (LIBS):

          Removed manual addition of some thread related libraries.  They
          are now in the auto-detection list in threads.m4.

        * m4/compiler.m4 (ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS):

          Improved support for HP aCC, and corrections.  Set WERROR to
          "+We67" to cause use of "#pragma once" to be an error instead of
          a warning.

        * m4/features.m4 (ACE_CHECK_ASYNCH_IO):

          Reduce timeout value in test program from INT_MAX to 5 seconds.

        * m4/threads.m4 (ACE_CHECK_THREADS):

          Add "-xnolib" to CXXFLAGS when testing thread flag support using
          Sun C++.  Sun C++ links a thread function stub library in the
          single-threaded case.  The stubs are no-ops but they exist,
          nonetheless.  This causes the link tests used to determine if a
          thread flag is needed to incorrectly pass.

Sun Feb  6 14:52:28 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.am (libACE_Demux_la_SOURCES):

          Added `QtReactor.cpp' to list of sources.

          (libACE_Other_la_SOURCES):

          Added `QoS_Session_Impl.cpp' and `QoS_Session_Factory.cpp' to
          the list of sources.

          (HEADER_FILES):

          Added `Min_Max.h', `QoS_Session_Impl.h' and
          `QoS_Session_Factory.h' to the list of headers.

          (INLINE_FILES):

          Added `QoS_Session_Impl.i' to the list of inline files.

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_LOFF_T):

          HP-UX has a 64 bit offset type "off64_t."

Sat Feb  5 20:49:50 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ltcf-c.sh:

        * ltmain.sh:

          Updated from latest libtool multi-language CVS branch.

        * m4/compiler.m4 (LDFLAGS):

          Remove "-xildoff" from the Sun C++ linker flags.  It doesn't
          seem to be needed since the compiler is smart enough to know
          when to use it.

Fri Feb  4 23:12:36 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp (handle_input): Added code to
          handle the case where all the data isn't available when we do a
          "recv()" from the socket.  Thanks to David X. Callaway
          <david.x.callaway@intel.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (open): Add a special-purpose case for NT to make sure
          that handles are reused in the client logging daemon.  Thanks to
          David X. Callaway <david.x.callaway@intel.com> for reporting
          this.

Fri Feb  4 19:29:31 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/Process.h:
        * ace/Process.cpp:
          The method command_line_argv () now returns a LPTSTR const *
          instead of a char * const *.  This enables it to compile under
          UNICODE.  Thanks to Steve Huston for pointing this out.

Fri Feb  4 16:46:42 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_tests.sh: Added . to PATH to be sure that tests which
          fork/exec and rely on PATH to find the program (like Pipe_Test)
          run correctly.

Fri Feb  4 16:31:22 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Message_Queue_Notifications_Test.cpp: Use ACE_HAS_THREADS
          rather than ACE_MT to leave out the ACE_Barriers in Watermark_Test
          class when building without threads to avoid compile errors on
          Sun C++ 4.2.

Fri Feb  4 15:11:53 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: New config file to handle building on
          HP-UX 11.00 with aCC, CC, or g++ (tested on 2.95.2). This file
          will be the new file for this platform when autoconf is not used.
          The other config-hpux-11* files will go away soon (maybe before
          ACE 5.1 is released).

Fri Feb  4 15:56:31 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU: Added -fstrict-prototype
          for HP-UX 11 - it resolves a pthread_atfork dispute between two
          slightly different declarations in pthread.h and unistd.h.

Thu Feb  3 11:38:15 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp (unbind): Removed the != 0 test since it was
          causing ambiguity problems for G++.  Thanks to David Levine for
          reporting this.

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp (unbind): Make sure to update the prev_ pointer
          so that we don't end up with an improperly linked list.  Thanks
          to Sandro Doro <doro.s@flashnet.it> for reporting this.

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_position_independent_malloc.cpp: Only
          explicitly instantiate a template for ACE_Malloc_T if we've got
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPEDENT_MALLOC enabled.  Thanks to David
          Levine for reporting this.

Thu Feb  3 11:40:27 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * docs/ACE-subsets.html:

          Added some notes about building ACE subsets using MSVC++.
          Thanks to Paul von Behren <vonbepd@lmy-deja.com> for providing
          the tips.

Thu Feb  3 11:38:15 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i,
        * ace/Synch.cpp: Added a cast of (short) to the use of USYNC_THREAD
          in order to prevent ambiguity problems for KAI C++.  Thanks to
          Chad Elliott <elliott_c@ociweb.com> for reporting this.  This
          fixes bugid 418.

        * ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): Added yet another cast to (long) for
          PRIORITY_MAX so that the types will be consistent for the
          ace_min() function.  Thanks to Stephen Moon <smoon@oxmol.co.uk>
          for reporting this.

Thu Feb  3 08:38:22 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/run_all_list.pm:
          Disable the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Event/* tests under single
          threaded builds because the tests do indeed use threads.

Wed Feb  2 23:35:19 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (thr_create): Added a cast to (long) for
          PRIORITY_MAX so that the types will be consistent for the
          ace_min() function.  Thanks to James Briggs
          <James.Briggs@dsto.defence.gov.au> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 02 21:56:32 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/check_build_logs: added -p option to check Purify
          output for anomaly and leak reports.

Wed Feb 02 16:29:19 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (lwp_getparam): if the LWP is in the TS
          class, set the policy to ACE_SCHED_OTHER instead of
          ACE_SCHED_RR.  That's the only thread scheduling policy
          that's supported in TS class on Solaris, where this function
          can be used.  Thanks to Chris Gill for tracking this bug down.

Wed Feb 02 12:46:53 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp (open): Changed to determine whether files should be
          opened using FILE_SHARE_DELETE flag on Win32 at runtime.  This
          allows ace libraries built for Win95/98 work correctly on NT.
          Thanks to Alex Chachanashvili <achacha@panix.com> for reporting
          this. [Bug 419]

        * ace/OS.{h,i,cpp}:  Added a static data member of type
          OSVERSIONINFO on win32 and initialize it in
          ACE_OS_Object_Manager::init to cache the OS version
          informaiton.

Wed Feb  2 11:08:33 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread.h: Clarified that cancel() is only portable
          on platforms that support cancellation.  Thanks to Jason
          Czavislak <jczavislak@osprey.smcm.edu> for motivating this.

Wed Feb  2 08:43:29 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_lxpthread.GNU:
          Add support for gprof, not very useful when compared to
          Quantify, but helps.

        * bin/auto_compile:
          Some tests print ERROR to indicate a failure.

Tue Feb  1 12:59:28 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ltcf-cxx.sh:

          Added HPUX shared library support for the aCC C++ compiler.

Tue Feb  1 09:40:50 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp (main):

          Exit with error if child exited with error.  Previously, the
          test returned successfully which was misleading.

        * ltcf-cxx.sh:
        * ltconfig:
        * ltmain.sh:

          Updated from latest libtool multi-language branch sources.

Mon Jan 31 00:09:11 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Added the following changes for Borland C++Builder 4:

          ace/OS.cpp: Removed processor architecture "hack" since
          Borland C++Builder 4 supports the required structure definition,
          and earlier versions are no longer supported.

          ace/OS.h: Do not define the ACE_No_Heap_Check class when
          building with Borland C++Builder.

          ace/OS.h, OS.i, config-win32-borland.h: Updated compiler version
          numbers for macro definitions.

          ace/Thread_Manager.h: ACE_Thread_Descriptor_Base class needs to
          be exported when building a DLL.

          include/makeinclude/build_dll.bor, build_exe.bor, build_lib.bor:
          Added makefile target for "clean".

          include/makeinclude/compiler.bor: Added -D_DEBUG compiler flag
          when building debug configuration.

          include/makeinclude/outputdir.bor: Allow object directory to be
          overridden.

          Thanks to Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for
          contributing these.

        * ace/OS.i: Minor reformatting.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast: Updated the implementation comments related to
          the subscribe_ifs() return value of 1 to indicate why this is
          needed.  Also, updated the documentation to indicate to check
          for -1 on failure.  Thanks to Mark Boriac for motivating this.

        * etc/Svc_Conf_l.cpp.diff: The context diff was incorrectly
          written, therefore, the wrong ACE_YY_BREAK was being commented
          out.  This is now fixed.  Thanks to David Levine for reporting
          this.

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_position_independent_malloc.cpp:
          Added a typedef to handle cases where
          ACE_HAS_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_MALLOC is not set.  Thanks to David
          Levine for reporting this.

        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/main.cpp (main): Changed
          int i to size_t i to avoid complaint about signed/unsigned
          mismatch.  Thanks to David Levine for reporting this.

Sun Jan 30 12:35:20 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Token.cpp (remove_entry): <tail_> should point to <prev>
          entry if we are removing the last entry in the queue.  Thanks to
          Irfan for pointing this out.

Sat Jan 29 12:56:16 2000  bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.13 released.

Fri Jan 28 20:14:20 2000  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.h:
        * ace/RB_Tree.i:
          current_size() was not const.

Fri Jan 28 13:57:37 2000  Fred Kuhns    <fredk@cs.wustl.edu>

        * fixed QoS realted bugs in QoS_Session_Impl.cpp QoS_Session_Impl.h
          SOCK_Dgram_Mcast.cpp.  Just added some error checking and
          check errno after call to join_leaf.

Thu Jan 27 20:25:37 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Token.cpp (shared_acquire and renew): Must decrement
          <waiters_> in case of condition variable wait errors and
          timeouts.

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (handle_events): If the user gives us a
          timeout, we must call <token_.acquire_read> with that timeout.
          Also, we must be more careful when dealing with the return value
          from <token_.acquire_read> to distinguish timeouts from errors.

Thu Jan 27 16:52:40 2000  James Hu <jxh@entera.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.*:
          Added a ACE_Message_Block::reset() method that puts the
          rd_ptr() and wr_ptr() back to the beginning of the message
          block.

Thu Jan 27 16:38:03 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_IO.h: Updated comments for ACE_Asynch_Read_Stream::read
          and ACE_Asynch_Write_Stream::write to state that the affected
          message block's wr_ptr and rd_ptr, respectively, are updated upon
          successful completion of the operation.

Thu Jan 27 11:06:22 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp: Strings duplicated using ACE::strnew() must
          be deleted using delete[] instead of delete.  Thanks to
          Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for catching this.

Thu Jan 27 09:11:52 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.h: Tried to clarify the comments regarding the
          handling of the data block pointer in the <ACE_Data_Block>
          manipulating functions. Thanks to Defang Zhou <dzhou@zoo.uvm.edu>
          for pointing out the lack of documentation regarding this.

        * THANKS: Added Defang Zhou to the Hall of Fame.

Thu Jan 27 00:15:08 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (recv_n and send_n): There was a bug in these
          methods introduced by the double while loops and the use of a
          single break ;-) Changed break to a return.  Thanks to the
          HPUX_aCC auto compile build for leading me to this bug!

Wed Jan 26 21:49:16 2000 James Hu <jxh@entera.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.*:
          Added new methods mark(), capacity(), and ::total_capacity().
          mark() points at base_ + cur_size_, capacity_ returns
          max_size_, and total_capacity_ sums all capcity()'s for all
          MBs in the continuation.  Changed space() to return
          mark() - wr_ptr().

Wed Jan 26 21:03:43 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp: Thanks to Adamo, Vince <adamo@vignette.com>
          who noticed that global_scale_factor_ wasn't being set on ACE_WIN32
          when QueryPerformanceFrequency () worked.  Now the code sets it
          to one when that happens.

Wed Jan 26 17:04:24 2000  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Proactor.h: Changed some comments to work better with the
          HTML man page generator.

Tue Jan 25 16:23:52 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_position_independent_malloc.cpp: Updated
          this example to use the ACE_Malloc_T<> template with the
          ACE_PI_Control_Block so that we get true "position-independent"
          malloc behavior.  Thanks to Rick Ohnemus
          <rjohnemus@systemware-inc.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jan 25 14:05:42 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Connector.cpp (connect_i): In addition to checking <sh_copy>
          for a zero value, <*sh_copy> should also be checked for a zero
          value.

Mon Jan 24 12:09:14 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Connector.cpp (connect_i):
        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp (ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy::connect_svc_handler):

          Cannot use <sh> after the connector lock has been released since
          other threads now have access to <sh> and can reset it.  We must
          use <sh_copy> instead (even when activating the newly connected
          svc_handler).  This should help with TAO/tests/MT_Client
          crashes.

Sun Jan 23 14:08:12 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (setgid):

          Added prototype for ACE_OS::setgid() method.

        * ace/OS.i (setgid):

          Added wrapper for setgid() system call.

          (getgid):

          Removed duplicate getgid() wrapper, and fixed it so that it
          returns with ENOTSUP on Win32 platforms, just like the getuid()
          wrapper.

Sat Jan 22 21:10:49 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Moved check for old GNU C++ to m4/compilers.m4.

        * m4/acinclude.m4 (ACE_CONVERT_WARNINGS_TO_ERRORS):

          This macro depends on the compiler settings performed by the
          ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS macro, so added an
          AC_REQUIRE([ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS]).

        * m4/compiler.m4 (ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS):

          Moved check for old GNU C++ from configure.in to here.

Sat Jan 22 15:27:39 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@danzon.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp: Updated this file to use the new
          "warning-free" generated file.

        * etc/Svc_Conf_l.cpp.diff: Commented out a YY_BREAK macro that was
          causing an "unreached statement" warning on some C++ compilers.
          Thanks to David Levine for reporting this.

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp: In the method
          test_empty_message_shutdown() we don't need to allocate a new
          message block when sending a "null" message.  This removes
          another memory leak.  Thanks to David Levine for reporting this.

Sat Jan 21 12:30:33 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:
        * ace/Template_Instantiations.cpp:

          Moved ACE_LOCAL_MEMORY_POOL/ACE_Null_Mutex related template
          instantions to ACE.cpp.  This fixes a single threaded build
          problem.

Thu Jan 20 09:15:50 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/bootstrap:

          Create NEWS file before automake is run.  Automake complains
          about missing NEWS file.

Thu Jan 20 09:03:37 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * NEWS:

          This file is currently generated during the autoconf support
          bootstrapping process.  As such, it shouldn't be placed under
          version control.  Removed this file from the repository.

        * configure.in:

          Added thread related preprocessor flags to CPPFLAGS prior to
          running the tests that check for the pthread_cancel() strtok_r()
          prototypes in case such flags are needed on some platforms.

          If the configure script determines that no usable thread library
          was found it then removes any thread related preprocessor flags
          from the CPPFLAGS preprocessor flags variable.

        * ace/README:

          Added description of ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID.

        * m4/threads.m4 (ACE_CHECK_THREADS):

          Remove any definitions of _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE from the
          preprocessor flags prior to checking if the compiler defines
          either one, and prior to searching for compiler thread flags by
          using the sed stream editor.  This is done instead of using the
          "-U" preproccesor flag since using that flag may undefine the
          same preprocessor macros potentially defined by the thread flag
          being tested.

          Added "kthread" to the list of thread flags to be searched.
          FreeBSD uses "-kthread" to enable support for kernel threads.

          (ACE_CHECK_THREAD_FLAGS):

          Relaxed criteria used to determine if compiler provides thread
          support by removing requirement that either _REENTRANT or
          _THREAD_SAFE should be defined.

          (ACE_CHECK_THREAD_CPPFLAGS):

          Added this test.  It checks if the compiler defines thread
          related preprocessor flags, such as _REENTRANT and
          _THREAD_SAFE.  The test is a compile-time test that is performed
          after the thread flag search test so that the thread flag (if
          any) is used during this test in case it defines any
          preprocessor flags.

Wed Jan 19 23:21:07 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp (test_queue_deactivation_shutdown): Make
          sure to release the message block once we've decided to shutdown
          the message queue to avoid a memory leak.  Thanks to David
          Levine for reporting this.

Tue Jan 19 13:33:08 2000  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ATM_Addr.cpp, ATM_QoS.cpp:
          Fixing format characters for ACE_Log_Msg::log() method.

Tue Jan 18 20:56:58 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Daniel Lang <dl@leo.org> to the list of contributors.

        * acconfig.h (ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID):

          Added this ACE macro to the list of macros.

        * configure.in:

          Thanks to Daniel Lang <dl@leo.org> for motivating the following
          ACE+autoconf related FreeBSD 3.4 fixes.

          (ACE_LACKS_SEMBUF_T):

          Improved the test for this macro by including <sys/types.h> and
          <sys/ipc.h> prior to <sys/sem.h>.   It incorrectly failed on
          FreeBSD.  Presumably this change should correct the problem.

          (ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID):

          Added test for this macro.  It should get defined for platforms
          that lack support for or have deprecated support for the
          cuserid() function, and have POSIX password file functions.

          (ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS):

          Added getpwuid() to list of functions necessary for
          ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS to *not* be defined.

          (ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_CANCEL):

          Added check for the pthread_cancel() prototype.  If it doesn't
          exist then don't use pthread_cancel(), i.e. define
          ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_CANCEL.  It it probably a bad idea to create a
          prototype for pthread_cancel in ACE, so just don't use
          pthread_cancel().  FreeBSD 3.4 appears to have the
          pthread_cancel() function but no prototype for it.

        * ace/OS.i (cuserid):

          Changed Linux implementation so that it can be used for other
          platforms by simply defining ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID.

          Added preprocessor error if ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID and
          ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS are both defined.  ACE's alternate
          cuserid() implementation requires that password file related
          functions exist.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          Define ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID on glibc 2.1.x since the use of the
          system cuserid() is discouraged.

        * m4/acinclude.m4:

          Cosmetic updates.

Tue Jan 18 22:53:18 2000  Toshio HORI <toshi@etl.go.jp>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks_5.x_g++.GNU:
          added support for compiling ACE for VxWorks/SPARC target.

Tue Jan 18 15:55:54 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/ACE-netsvcs.html: Fixed a typo.  Thanks to
          Brian Jones <bjones@edgemail.com> for reporting this.

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Updated the text from
          Dr. Toshio HORI <toshi@etl.go.jp>.

Tue Jan 18 15:37:25 2000  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ATM_Connector.{cpp,h,i}, ATM_QoS.{cpp,h}, ATM_Stream.{cpp,i}:
          Adding changes to support FORE's latest WinSock2 ATM support.

Tue Jan 18 13:44:34 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp: Replaced int with size_t to
          prevent compiler warnings comparing signed and unsigned
          quantities.

Tue Jan 18 09:13:43 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: ACE works just fine on RedHat 5.1 and
          later, not just 5.1 through 6.1.  Thanks to Raj Narayanaswamy
          <rnarayanaswamy@hologic.com> for asking about this.

Mon Jan 17 18:03:17 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp: Under WIN32, the ACE_Process_Manager
          registered itself as an event handler with ACE_Reactor, but did
          not properly unregister itself when it closed.  For error to be
          noticed, you must instantiate ACE_Process_Manager with an
          ACE_Reactor.  ACE_Process_Manager should *not* be run as a
          singleton.  It must be instantiated such that it will be
          destroyed *before* the ACE_Reactor is destroyed.

          When you call ACE_Process_Manager::spawn, the newly created
          process is added to the ACE_Process_Manager's process table and
          (under WIN32) the ACE_Process_Manager is registered as an event
          handler for the new process (ace/Process_Manager.cpp, line 523)
          using this call:

          r->register_handler (this, proc->gethandle ());

          This will happen for every process spawned. Thus,
          ACE_Process_Manager will potentially be associated with more
          than one WIN32 process handle.

          When the ACE_Process_Manager was destroyed, the dtor calls
          ACE_Process_Manager::close which (for WIN32) attempts to remove
          ACE_Process_Manager as an Event_Handler from the ACE_Reactor
          using the following code (ace/Process_Manager.cpp, line 256)

          this->reactor ()->remove_handler (this, 0);

          This version of ACE_Reactor::remove_handler is:

          int ACE_Reactor::remove_handler
          (
                ACE_Event_Handler *event_handler,
                ACE_Reactor_Mask mask
          );

          It calls event_handler->get_handle() to obtain the handle to
          which 'event_handler' is associated.  The problem is that
          ACE_Process_Manager::get_handle returns ACE_INVALID_HANDLE, so
          the ACE_Reactor never properly unregistered the
          ACE_Process_Manager. This is now fixed and should work correctly
          on Win32 and other platforms.

          Thanks to Greg Gallant <gcg@intercap.com> for tracking all this
          down and providing the fix.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (open): Wrapped the setpgid() call with a
          #if !defined (ACE_LACKS_SETPGID) to remove spurious run-time
          warnings on platforms that don't support setpgid().  Thanks to
          Craig Perras <cperras@watchguard.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/NT_Service: Reformatted this header to conform to the ACE
          programming guidelines.  Also, replaced

          #if defined (ACE_HAS_WINNT4) && ACE_HAS_WINNT4 != 0)

          with

          #if defined (ACE_WIN32)

          This change allows a single dll to be built that supports both
          NT and Win9x.  The app can use GetVersionEx() to check whether
          the platform is NT or not dynamically, or it can just call the
          various service functions, which will return a function not
          supported error.  Thanks to Craig Perras
          <cperras@watchguard.com> for reporting this.

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp: Enhanced this test to illustrate how
          to shut down Tasks using either the "empty message" strategy or
          the "queue deactivation" strategy.

        * ace/Message_Queue.h: Updated the documentation of the enqueue*()
          and dequeue*() methods to clarify which errno values are set
          when the calls return -1.

        * examples/Threads/thread_pool.cpp: Updated this example to
          remove the use of the now-defunct "wait_for_threads_to_shutdown"
          feature of ACE_Task.

        * ace/Task_T: Removed the recent feature added on

          Sat Jan  8 09:44:51 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt
          <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

          that allowed to an ACE_Task's destructor to wait for threads in
          a task to exit.  It turns out this is practically impossible to
          use correctly because of the way that destructors are destroyed
          from the "top down".  However, it's trivial to get the same
          behavior by simply calling the Tasks's wait() method whenever
          you want to implement barrier synchronization on a Task's thread
          exits.

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Test.cpp: Updated this test to illustrate
          various strategies to wait for threads to exit.  Thanks to Mark
          C. Barnes <marcus@muse3d.com> for motivating this example.

Mon Jan 17 14:20:17 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:
        * ace/OS.i: Changed the signature of isatty to (int) and added a
          (ACE_HANDLE) version for Win32.

        * ace/Makefile:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_l.cpp: Removed the explicit casting of fileno()
          from int to ACE_HANDLE.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h: Added ACE_LACKS_ISATTY.

        * ace/OS.i (isatty): Removed WinCE specific section.

Mon Jan 17 00:53:37 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Added a cast to (long) for ACE_THR_PRI_FIFO_MIN,
          ACE_THR_PRI_FIFO_MAX ACE_THR_PRI_RR_MIN, ACE_THR_PRI_RR_MAX,
          ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_MIN, ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_MAX since these are all
          used as priority values, which is defined as a long.  This
          should solve a problem with the ACE_MAX()/ACE_MIN() templates on
          Linux with G++.  Thanks to Bala for reporting this problem.

        * netsvcs/lib/Logging_Strategy: Added a new '-w' option that
          instructs the logging strategy to "wipeout", rather than append
          to, an existing logfile.  Thanks to David X. Callaway
          <david.x.callaway@intel.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 16 21:32:18 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Moved the #defines for ACE_MIN and ACE_MAX into the
          new $ACE_ROOT/Min_Max.h file, along with their template function
          definitions.

        * ace: Added a new file called Min_Max.h that uses templates, rather
          than macros, to implement the ACE_MIN and ACE_MAX macros.  This
          is a "Good Thing" because the use of macros has undesirable
          side-effects due to the "call-by-name" semantics of macro
          paramter expansion...  If for some reason your compiler can't
          handle this, please #define ACE_LACKS_MIN_MAX_TEMPLATES in your
          config.h file.  Thanks to Derek Dominish
          <Derek.Dominish@Australia.Boeing.com> for contributing this.

Sun Jan 16 16:43:10 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/config.h.in:

          Removed this file from the repository.  It is automatically
          generated when autoconf support is bootstrapped into a
          workspace.

Sun Jan 16 16:13:00 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * acconfig.h:
        * configure.in:

          Added support/tests for:

            ACE_LACKS_SETREGID
            ACE_LACKS_SETREUID
            ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTO
            ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTO

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/Configuration.cpp:

          Moved template instantiations related to ACE_LOCAL_MEMORY_POOL
          to ACE.cpp, and fixed them so that they work in the single
          threaded case.  The idea is to place this set of template
          instantiations in a "common" area, since TAO also needs these
          templates instantations.

Sun Jan 16 10:49:26 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Makefile (Svc_Conf_l.cpp): Fixed the "isatty()" sed hack to
          use fileno and then add a cast to (ACE_HANDLE) since this is
          what the ACE_OS::isatty() wrapper expects Thanks to Nanbor and
          Bala for reporting this.

        * etc/Svc_Conf_l.cpp.diff: Added a #define for ACE_YY_NO_UNPUT
          to supress an unnecessary warning.

        * tests/ARGV_Test.cpp (main): Fixed several warnings.

        * ace/Process.i: Rearranged the order of the process_name() methods
          so they are defined before being used/inlined.

Sat Jan 15 19:59:00 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace: Reran flex on Svc_Conf.y to generate the Svc_Conf_l.cpp file
          with Darrell's fixes.

Sat Jan 15 15:49:28 2000  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@uci.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Readded the ACE_LACKS_FCNTL macro, since it seems to have been
          missed in the latest changes to the config-win32 files.

        * ace/Makefile:
          With Doug's help, added a couple of new commands to the generation
          of the Svc_Conf_l.cpp, because the generated files were causing
          a warning on NT.

Sat Jan 15 00:41:12 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ARGV: Added a new add() method that adds an entire argv
          array in one fell swoop.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/main.cpp (main): Replaced
          the ad hoc use of argc/argv processing with the ACE_ARGV
          approach.

        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/main.cpp (main): Replaced
          the ad hoc use of argc/argv processing with the ACE_ARGV
          approach.  Note that this required the enhancement shown in the
          following bullet.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.l: Updated the Service Configurator lexer so that
          it will also accept strings that are delimited by single quotes,
          as well as double quotes.  This helps to simplify the use of
          ACE_ARGV to create svc.conf entries "on-the-fly".

        * tests: Added a new test ARGV_Test.cpp that  illustrates how to
          use advanced features of <ACE_ARGV>.  Thanks to Suresh Kannan
          <kannan@uav.ae.gatech.edu> for contributing this.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Added

          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREGID
          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREUID

          Thanks to Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/Task.h: Added a comment to the suspend() and resume() methods
          encouraging developers not to use these methods unless
          absolutely necessary.  Thanks to Mark C. Barnes <marcus@muse3d.com>
          for motivating this.

        * ace: Reorganized the config-win32*.h files
          to insulate the different compiler configurations from each
          other.  The changes are as follows:

          * Concatenated config-win32.h and config-win32-common.h to form
            the new config-win32-common.h.

          * Moved MSVC-specific language defines from config-win32-common.h
            into config-win32-msvc.h

          * Updated the other compilers' files to add required language
            defines originally in config-win32-common.h.

          Thanks to Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for
          contributing this.

Fri Jan 14 15:42:28 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp (work_pending): Made the code more
          general such that any thread can call it, i.e., it is not
          limited to the owner thread.  This change alleviated the need
          for the specialization in TP_Reactor.

Fri Jan 14 01:48:26 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process: Moved the command_line_argv() from the
          non-Win32 part of the ACE_Process class to the generic
          part since it shouldn't depend on the platform.  Thanks
          to Michael Kircher for reporting this.

        * ace/Process: Consider a process that spawns a number of
          processes using a same executable name but with different
          arguments <say svc.conf file..>. Depending on the arguments,
          each process does different things.  Currently
          <ACE_Process::spawn> calls <execvp> with argv[0] as the
          exeutable name. Therefore, if you do a <ps> command now, all
          these processes will look the same, since they are all launched
          with the same command.

          But for <execvp> call, you could actually give a different
          executable name and a different argv[0]. This helps us to have
          the name for a process to be different from the executable
          name. In this case, <ps> command will show the processes with
          different argv[0] names.

          Therefore, we added a method called <process_name> to
          ACE_Process_Options to specify the executable name.  If you do
          not call <process_name> method, argv[0] is taken as the
          executable name.  Thanks to Alex Arulanthu <alex@sylantro.com>
          for these enhancements.

Thu Jan 13 20:11:55 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp (work_pending): This version is similar to
          the select reactor except there is no owner check.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp (work_pending): The handle set must be
          copied before calling select().

Thu Jan 13 16:06:19 2000  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_compile:
        * bin/run_all.pl:
        * bin/run_all_list.pm: Added an AMI test case for testing in the
          nightly builds.

Wed Jan 12 23:46:36 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.h: Updated the
          ACE_Service_Config::close_singletons() method documentation to
          reflect the fact that it no longer deletes the Allocator, which
          is deleted by the ACE_Object_Manager now.  Thanks to Craig
          Perras <cperras@watchguard.com> for reporting this.

Wed Jan 12 09:49:57 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/make_release: don't create diffs if not installing
          the kit.

Wed Jan 12 07:22:42 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES): removed
          man/man3/Makefile.am and man/html/Makefile.am.  There
          addition in
          Tue Jan  4 12:58:54 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>
          caused creation of .zip files to break.  zip doesn't like
          multiple occurrences of a file, apparently. [Bug 408]

Tue Jan 11 21:59:34 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/make_release (create_kit): disable creation of
          md5 files, because it didn't work:  just empty files
          were created.  I think that it was looking in the wrong
          directory.

Tue Jan 11 21:26:14 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/make_release (check_workspace): removed the bootstrap
          invocation.  That is done in create_kit (), and should only
          be done once.  (create_kit): set umask to 2, so that the
          kits will have group write permission.

Tue Jan 11 17:39:10 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config.h: Updated the ACE_Service_Config::close()
          method documentation to reflect the fact that it no longer
          closes the singletons (these are closed by the
          ACE_Object_Manager now).  Thanks to Craig Perras
          <cperras@watchguard.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jan 11 17:22:21 2000  bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.12 released.

Mon Jan 10 12:50:10 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.h (class ACE_Select_Reactor_T): Reformatted the
          documentation a bit...

Mon Jan 10 15:37:22 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Pair_T: Added const accessors to the pair class.  Also,
          changed the Reference_Pair accessors to be const.  Thanks to
          Serge Kolgan <skolgan@cisco.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan  9 00:25:58 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Process.i (setreugid): Added an ACE_UNUSED_ARG for the
          ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS case.  Thanks to David for catching
          this!

        * ace/Process.i (setreugid): Guard against the case where
          ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS.  Thanks to David Levine for
          reporting this problem with VxWorks.

        * ace/Pair_T.h: Reformatted to conform to the ACE style.

Sat Jan  8 09:44:51 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Threads/thread_pool.cpp: Revised the example to
          illustrate the new "wait_for_threads_in_destructor" feature of
          ACE_Task.

        * examples/Threads/task_four.cpp: Reformatted the code.

        * ace/Task_T: Added a new flag to the constructor that enables
          applications to request that an ACE_Task will wait in its
          destructor for any and all threads in the task to exit before
          returning.  Thanks to Valery Arkhangorodsky
          <valerya@servicesoft.com> for suggesting this.

        * ace/OS.i: Needed to add an extern "C" {} block around the
          setregid() and setreuid() functions.  Thanks to David Levine
          for reporting this.

Fri Jan  7 20:01:48 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i,
          ace/config-sunos5.5.h: Some platforms seem to lack function
          prototypes for setreuid() and setregid(), even though they are
          in the library.  Therefore, I've added

          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREGID_PROTOTYPE

          and

          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREUID_PROTOTYPE

          macros to handle this case.

        * ace/Process: Added support to allow UNIX applications to
          automagically set the real and effective user/group ids when
          ACE_Process::spawn() is called.  Thanks to Craig Perras
          <cperras@watchguard.com> for contributing this.

        * ace: Updated the following files to include

          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREGID
          #define ACE_LACKS_SETREUID

          config-chorus.h
          config-cray.h:168
          config-cygwin32-common.h
          config-freebsd-pthread.h
          config-freebsd.h:33
          config-hpux-9.x.h
          config-lynxos.h
          config-netbsd.h
          config-sunos4-g++.h
          config-sunos4-sun4.1.4.h
          config-win32-common.h

          Ideally, Ossama's autoconf stuff will auto-detect anything that
          I'm missing.

        * ace/OS: Added wrapper facade methods for setregid() and
          setregid().

Fri Jan  7 16:05:32 2000  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Only define ACE_HAS_XT if both the Xt headers and libraries are
          available.  Previously, the existence of the Xt libraries was
          not part of the XtReactor enable criterion.

        * m4/compiler.m4 (ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS):

          Added C++ preprocessor flag documentation and trivial support.

          Many AIX related compiler flag updates.

        * m4/platform.m4 (ACE_SET_PLATFORM_MACROS):

          Moved/consolidated platform-specific settings from configure.in
          to here.

          Improved AIX support (updates, fixes, etc).

Fri Jan  7 10:48:55 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/run_all_list.pm: Added missing commas.

Thu Jan 06 22:26:42 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (fcntl): There was a special fcntl() for Win32.
          Removed that special version and added ACE_LACKS_FCNTL to
          config-win32-common.h.

        * ace/ACE.cpp: Removed the non-"_n" versions of send/recv
          functions that deal with message blocks.  Since we deal with
          continuation chains and linked messages, we are essentially
          dealing with "_n" style functions.  Also, improved the error
          handling in case of timeouts.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp
          (ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy::connect_svc_handler): If an error
          occurs while activating the handler, the <activate_svc_handler>
          method will close the handler.  We must set the handler to zero
          to make sure that the higher layer doesn't try to close the
          handler again!

Thu Jan  6 15:00:56 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * aclocal.m4:
        * configure:
        * All Makefile.in:

          Removed these files.  They are automatically generated, so they
          should not be in the repository.  Thanks to David for pointing
          out that my ACE+autoconf updates caused CVS conflicts when
          updating existing workspaces.

Wed Jan  5 10:09:35 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Dirent.h: Added an ACE_Export on the ACE_Dirent class.  I'm
          surprised this hasn't been a problem before...  Thanks to
          Dominic Williams <dom@connected-place.co.uk> for indirectly
          motivating this change.

        * ace/SString.h: Updated the documentation for the various string
          wrapper facades to clarify that they don't perform any locking.
          Thanks to Jerry Jiang <javalist@21cn.com> for motivating this.

Wed Jan 05 09:53:04 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Stream.[hi] (sendv_n): added const to iov[]
          argument declaration.  Thanks to Rob Ruff <rruff@scires.com>
          for reporting that TAO's AV service failed to compile
          with Sun CC 5.0 because of this.

Tue Jan  4 15:06:41 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Added note that asks user to use stock ACE build procedure
          detailed in ACE-INSTALL.html in the event that the configure
          script fails.

Tue Jan  4 14:40:17 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          AIX defines "off64_t" as its 64 bit offset type.  Typedef
          ACE_LOFF_T as that type if ACE_HAS_LLSEEK or ACE_HAS_LSEEK64 is
          defined.  This should correct a problem that occurred during an
          AIX configure script run.  Thanks to Mike Winter for pointing
          this out.

Tue Jan  4 14:09:51 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Fixed test that checks if sched.h is needed for thread
          scheduling definitions.  This should correct problems discovered
          on RedHat 6.1 installations.  Thanks to

          Improved sys_nerr and sys_errlist[] tests by checking for
          external global variables in libraries.  This should correct a
          problem discovered in an AIX configure script run.  Thanks to
          Mike Winter for providing feedback.

Tue Jan  4 13:23:26 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config: Updated the documentation for the various
          open() methods and the constructors.  Thanks to Christopher
          Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jan  4 12:58:54 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

          man/man3/Makefile.am and man/html/Makefile.am previously weren't
          being labelled.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

Mon Jan  3 21:01:53 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests: Updated the
          README file so it'll point to the right documentation!  Thanks
          to John Buttitto for reporting this.

Tue Jan 04 07:26:24 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.11 released.

Mon Jan 03 07:34:38 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): return res instead of *res, because
          the function returns a struct tm *, not a struct tm.

Sun Jan  2 11:02:54 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): We should return *res rather than
          *result to make the behavior correct for Win32.  Thanks to
          J. Afshar <jafshar@vignette.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 02 00:50:00 2000  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.{cpp, h, i}
          ace/Signal.cpp
          ace/Synch.cpp
          ace/config-psos-diab-ppc.h: Added support for native mutexs,
          condition variables, and thread-specific storage in pSOS.  Native
          pSOS mutexes, where available, support several cool features,
          including lock recursion and priority inheritance protocol and
          priority ceiling protocol support.

Sat Jan 01 09:16:39 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ChangeLog,Makefile: moved to ChangeLog-99b.
