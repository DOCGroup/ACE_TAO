          These files were using improper syntax to compare the value of
          _XOPEN_SOURCE against a constant that caused compilation errors on
          HP-UX 11.23 with HP aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.06.00.  For example:
          #if defined (_XOPEN_SOURCE) && (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500)
          was changed to:
          #if (defined _XOPEN_SOURCE && (_XOPEN_SOURCE - 0) >= 500)

          Thanks to Paul Koch <paul.koch@mci.com> for reporting this problem
          and providing the solution.

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added new RTEvent_Skel and RTEvent_Serv libraries and removed
          RTOldEvent

Tue May 24 20:09:28 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/time.mpb:

          Inherit from svc_utils.mpb.

        * ace/config-irix6.x-common.h:
        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
          Changed incorrect define ACE_USES_NEW_TERMIOS to
          ACE_USES_NEW_TERMIOS_STRUCT.

Tue May 24 09:31:42 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Use $(ILIBMODIFIER) instead of $(LIBMODIFIER).

        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Added missing ACE_TEXT () around option strings.  This was causing
          a very strange file to show up after the Process_Mutex_Test was
          run in the Borland unicode build and the Pipe_Test didn't run at
          all.

Tue May 24 00:17:09 2005  Emre Turkay  <turkaye@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/cidlc.mpb:

          Created a base project for cidlc & ccf project files.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.h:
          Added include "ace/os_include/os_stdio.h" to fix compile
          problem on LynxOS. Thanks to Christine Ballard
          <christine.ballard at lmco dot com> for reporting the problem.

Mon May 23 23:11:14 2005  Emre Turkay  <turkaye@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * contrib/utility/*:

          Added the utility library.

Mon May 23 16:38:13 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/post_completions.cpp: Made use of the
          ACE_POSIX_SIG_Proactor-based test dependent on
          ACE_HAS_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS, not ACE_POSIX_SIG_PROACTOR.
          ACE_POSIX_SIG_PROACTOR indicates a preference for that proactor
          implementation when one is not specified; it's not a capability
          indicator. The presence of the ACE_POSIX_SIG_Proactor implementation
          is based on the ACE_HAS_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS setting, so that's
          what's used to decide whether to explicitly use
          ACE_POSIX_SIG_Proactor. This fixes a build error on Mac OS X Tiger
          with autoconfigure, as well as any other platform with AIO
          support that doesn't declare a Proactor implementation preference.
          Thanks to J.T. Conklin for raising this issue and working on testing
          fixes.

Mon May 23 14:52:19 2005  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * ace/String_Base.h:
        * ace/String_Base.inl:
        * ace/String_Base.cpp:

          Fixed some documentation bugs, and added some new features to
          this class.
          New efficient overloads for string concatenation.
          Fixed clear(1) to work as documented.
          Used a more optimal string growth when concatenating strings.
          Performance optimizations for string concatenation.

        * tests/SString_Test.cpp:

          Test the new string concatenation overloads.

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Enabled new ImR tests, and grouped all ImR tests together.

Mon May 23 12:26:19 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Thread.h: Doxygen-ized the join() comments.

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp:
          Reverted change below, causes compile errors with some compilers

Mon May 23 12:50:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Lib_Find.cpp:
          Small const fix

Mon May 23 10:56:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftrtevent.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcorbaevent.mpb:
          Use rtevent_serv as base project. These projects use some rtevent
          implementation stuff so just the client side stubs are not enough.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventexe.mpb:
          Use rtevent_skel as base project

Mon May 23 10:24:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtevent_serv.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtevent_skel.mpb:
          New files, the RTEvent service is being split in 3 libs so
          we need some new base projects

Mon May 23 05:47:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtoldevent.mpb:
          Removed this file

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rteventlogadmin.mpb:
          Removed rtoldevent as base project

Sun May 22 12:01:46 2005  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp:

          Fixed a typo in comment.

Fri May 20 21:11:07 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/DLL.cpp (~ACE_DLL):

          Explicitly delete() this->dll_name_.  It is normally delete()d
          in ACE_DLL::close().  However, that may not occur if full
          ACE_DLL initialization is interruepted due to errors
          (e.g. attempting to open a DSO/DLL that does not exist).  Fixes
          a memory leak.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (msg_ostream):

          Delete the previously allocated ostream prior to setting the new
          one, if necessary.  Fixes a memory leak.

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.h (ACE_Logging_Strategy):

          Converted integer fields that are really booleans to be of type
          "bool", and reordered fields to avoid excessive alignment
          padding.  Reduces size of this class by 8 bytes on most
          platforms.

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp:

          Initialize fields in base member initializer list to prevent
          accidental use of uninitialized fields.

          Use C++ "true" and "false" instead of "1" and "0", respectively,
          when setting boolean field values.

        * ace/SString.h (ACE_Auto_String_Free):

          Corrected documentation suggesting use of
          ACE_Auto_Array_Ptr<char *>.  The correct template argument is
          "char", not "char *".

        * tests/CDR_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Multicast_Test.cpp:

          Fixed memory leaks.

        * tests/Logging_Strategy_Test.cpp:

          Updated to be consistent with boolean field changes in
          ACE_Logging_Strategy class.

        * tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp (delete_reactor):

          Reordered finalization code to prevent memory leak.

Fri May 20 19:05:22 2005  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread.h (ACE_Thread): Updated the documentation of
          ACE_Thread::join().  Thanks to Alan Balasuar
          <balasuar@gmail.com> for motivating this fix.

Sat May 21 18:30:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/HTBP/Reactor_Tests/server.cpp:
          Fixed value computed is not used warning in GCC IA64 build

Fri May 20 15:28:00 2005  Gary Maxey  <gary.maxey@hp.com>

        * ace/config-lite.h

          Added TANDEM platform for ACE_NOTREACHED macro.

Thu May 19 19:10:30 2005  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * apps/Gateway/Gateway/Concrete_Connection_Handlers.cpp
          (handle_output):

          Removed

            ACE_ASSERT (errno == EWOULDBLOCK);

          since errno may have been changed by this point.  Thanks to Ro
          Madhavan <ro_madhavan@sify.com> for reporting this.

Thu May 19 18:50:23 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ICMP_Socket.{h cpp inl}:
        * ace/Ping_Socket.{h cpp inl}:
        * tests/Network_Adapters_Test.{cpp, h}: Moved ICMP_Socket and
          Ping_Socket out of the ACE namespace and changed names to
          ACE_ICMP_Socket and ACE_Ping_Socket, respectively. Also fixed up
          some text strings with ACE_TEXT.
          ACE_ICMP_Socket now does not check for root euid - allow the OS to
          do whatever checks it requires/implements.
          Improved implementation of ACE_Ping_Socket.
          Thanks to Robert Iakobashvili for these improvements and changes.

Thu May 19 15:59:38 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK.h: Clarified doc on close() - it sets the object's
          handle to ACE_INVALID_HANDLE.

Thu May 19 08:58:48 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/INET_Addr.inl:

          Moved remaining virtual methods out of line.  See "Wed May 18
          16:19:32 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>" for
          details.

Thu May 19 15:21:00 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidl3toidl2defaults.mpb:

          Added line

          after += TAO_IDL3_TO_IDL2_EXE

          to the config file to make sure that the executable is built
          before being used in a test, example or application. Thanks to
          Chad Elliott <elliott_c@ociweb.com> for suggesting the change.

Thu May 19 14:05:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * netsvcs/clients/Logger/indirect_logging.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp:
          When we can't open the logger print out an error and exit with -1.

Thu May 19 00:38:46 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config-g++-common.h:
        * config-lite.h:

          Removed ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_{DECLARATION,DECLARE} macro
          definitions.  They do not provide the expected behavior in g++
          4.0 configurations, as they do in VC++ configurations.

Wed May 18 16:19:32 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ATM_Addr.cpp:

        * ace/Service_Types.inl:
        * ace/UNIX_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/UNIX_Addr.inl:

          Moved virtual method implementation out-of-line.  Since the
          classes to which they belong are exported, inlining them will
          cause problems when attempting to perform a dynamic_cast<> in
          binaries built with g++ 4.0's -fvisibility-inlines-hidden
          command line option.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp (dump):

          Removed ACE_INLINE from this out of line method.

Wed May 18 15:44:12 UTC 2005  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Semaphore.cpp:

          Removed check for missing shm_open() since this causes problems
          for platforms supporting POSIX_SEM (and thus not using
          shm_open/open).  Thanks to Raoul Gough <Raoul dot Gough at liffe
          dot com> for reporting this.

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_UNNAMED_SEMAPHORE to compensate for above
          change.

Wed May 18 14:37:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/ASX/Message_Queue/buffer_stream.cpp:
          Initialise all pointers with 0

Wed May 18 09:25:35 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:

          Fixed a problem that I introduced in a previous change.  Resource
          files were not being handled properly and the
          platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU file was referencing $(VSHOBJS1)
          which I removed.

        * include/makeinclude/all_in_one.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:

          Removed the file rules.bin.GNU and all references to it.

Tue May 17 20:58:46 UTC 2005  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taoidl3toidl2defaults.mpb:

          New file, a base project for the tao_idl3_to_idl2 executable,
          so it can be executed automatically in a test or example.

Tue May 17 18:31:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/ASX/Message_Queue/ASX_Message_Queue.mpc:
          Don't build the buffer_stream exe when wchar is enabled, this
          example expects just char.

Tue May 17 09:32:01 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Collection_Test.cpp:

          Avoid casting between a pointer to a function and a pointer to
          an object.  ISO C++ forbids such casts.  Fixes a g++ 4.0
          warning.

        * ace/Functor.h:
        * ace/Functor.inl:
        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
        * ace/ace_wchar.h:
        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:

          Add a new ACE_LACKS_NATIVE_WCHAR_T macro, which can be used to
          check whether a platform supports overloading on wchar_t without
          conflict.  The existing ACE_WSTRING_HAS_USHORT_SUPPORT was
          incorrectly being used for two purposes. This setting should let
          us enable native wchar_t support on VC7+.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:

          Add a static_cast<long> because time_t is 64bit on some platforms
          where long is 32 bit.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:

          Mask out the X_OK(6) bit for the amode parameter of the access()
          function because this bit is illegal on Win32 and will assert.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-7.h:

          Clarify comment on ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_EXPORT.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h:

          Disable deprecation warning 4996, because the
          _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE macro doesn't appear to work
          correctly.

        * ace/streams.h:

          Add missing "using std::ios_base".

Mon May 16 21:39:30 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Ping_Socket.h (Ping_Socket):

          Corrected class name in Doxygen documentation.

Mon May 16 15:58:29 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Corrected the names of the Sun compilers supported.
          Thanks to Nick Todd <nicholas dot todd at gs dot com> for
          bringing this error to our attention.

        * THANKS: Added Nick Todd to the Hall of Fame.

Mon May 16 12:33:29 2005  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Mario Di Giacomo to the Hall of Fame.

        * ace/Service_Templates.cpp:

          Include "ace/SString.h" to pull in ACE_TString declaration.
          Thanks to Mario Di Giacomo <mdigiacomo at anteon dot com> for
          reporting the problem.

        * tests/Cache_Map_Manager_Test.cpp (find_test_cache):

          Fixed "variable may be used uninitialized" warning.

Mon May 16 19:13:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Malloc.h:
          Doxygen improvement

Mon May 16 10:57:57 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Reset DEFAULT_INCLUDES to address ambiguity between system's
          signal.h and semaphore.h headers and ACE's Signal.h and
          Semaphore.h headers on case insensitive file systems.

          This may be the best setting for all ACE/TAO Makefile.am's,
          but this is the only one that requires it.

Mon May 16 10:56:31 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Add ACE_LD_SEARCH_PATH and ACE_DLL_SUFFIX settings for
          darwin/MacOSX.

          Add ACE_HAS_NANOSLEEP feature test check.

Mon May 16 10:49:10 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:

          Add defined(__APPLE__) to conditional wrapping sigval_t type
          definition.

Mon May 16 10:45:18 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/ace.m4 (ACE_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS):

          Changed *win* patterns to *win32* to avoid matching darwin,

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Enabled the Exposed_Policies test on Linux.

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Added a !NO_IFR configuration to each IFR related test.
          The IFR_Service will not run on MacOS X unless TAO is built
          statically due to gcc's in ability to deal with template
          instantiated singletons correctly.

          Added a NO_LOADAVG configuration to avoid running the load average
          based test on platforms that do not have support for obtaining the
          load average from the system.

          Added a configuration for NO_MCAST for machines that do not have
          multicast capabilities or the multicast implementation is broken.

          Added !STATIC to two LoadManager tests to support static builds on
          Windows.

          that our users can easily define their own values.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          Disable warning 1572 (floating point warning), correct name of Qt
          library and only set several variables when they are not set yet

Mon May 16 09:01:07 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Conn_Test.cpp:

          Force this test to use threads (instead of fork) on MacOS X.

        * tests/FIFO_Test.cpp:

          Sleep 1 second (as is done on AIX and HP-UX) before attempting to
          receive from the fifo.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:

          Set global_event_loop_thread_variable before activating the thread
          that may use it.

        * tests/Naming_Test.cpp:

          Allow the user to determine the location of the context file by
          the TMPDIR, TEMP and TMP environment variables.

        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Use the value from argv[0] instead of hardcoding the exe name.
          The hardcoded name does not work on Windows Release builds.

        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.cpp:

          Use threads by default on HP-UX instead of fork.
          Added a timeout for the recv() call in
          Counting_Service::handle_input() for HP-UX only.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Added a configuration for NO_MCAST for machines that do not have
          multicast capabilities or the multicast implementation is broken.

        * tests/SSL/aix_hack_for_main.cpp:
        * tests/aix_hack_for_main.cpp:

          Removed these files.  They are no longer needed due to MPC.

Mon May 16 08:52:11 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/crosscompile.mpb:

          Added lib_warning, require_warning and avoid_warning to the list
          of targets in the CROSS-COMPILE portion.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcorbaevent.mpb:

          The RTCORBAEvent library requires the CosNaming library.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Support the MPC feature that will allow users to specify arbitrary
          input file dependencies.

          Changed the OBJS setting to use $(notdir) only if the source file
          contains ../ and added explicit rules for source files that are
          located in subdirectories.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx_panther.GNU:

          Explicitly default the threads variable to threads=1.  This
          was preventing ACE_TMCast from building.
          Change the optimization option to -O2.  -O3 was causing some
          link problems in the IDL compiler.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:

          Allow users to override the inline and exceptions settings.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.5.x.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Provide better support for building for VxWorks on a Windows host
          without Cygwin.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Changed the SHOBJS setting to be consistent with the OBJS setting.
          Also, removed VLOBJS and SHOBJS1 which were redundant and set
          exactly as SHOBJS was.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Set ec_typed_events to 1 by default.  This matches the default for
          MPC features.

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Removed this file.  It is no longer necessary.

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-common.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:

          Put ACE_LIB_TEXT around all ACE_CC_NAME definitions to support
          wide character builds on Solaris, QNX and IRIX.

        * ace/ACE_export.h:

          Added support for SunCC 5.6.

        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.h:
        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.cpp:

          Added an explicit constructor that takes a const char* for
          symmetry with the ACE_INET_Addr class.

        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:

          Removed a bug workaround for aCC A.03.04.  It is no longer a
          problem to specify other mmap base addresses when running
          64-bit HP-UX applications.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/config-macosx-panther.h:
        * ace/Sched_Params.cpp:

          MacOS X has pthread_getschedparam but has the ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED
          macro defined.  I have added a new macro,
          ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SCHEDPARAM, that can be defined to use
          pthread_getschedparam and pthread_setschedparam even when
          ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED is defined.


        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Fixed an issue that arose within the static builds on Windows.
          The ACE_Thread_Mutex static data member of the
          TSS_Cleanup_Instance class was being used (in the
          TSS_Cleanup_Instance constructor) before it was statically
          initialized.  I have switched it (and the condition variable
          associated with it) to a pointer that is allocated the first time
          into the TSS_Cleanup_Instance constructor.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp:

          Committing a change from Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>.
          The close() method failed to unregister the reactor on Windows.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Removed an unnecessary 'install' setting.

        * ace/config-sunos5.10.h:

          SunOS 5.10 has scandir (ACE_HAS_SCANDIR).

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h:

          When using LKSCTP, include <netinet/in.h> before <netinet/sctp.h>
          to avoid macro problems.

Sun May 15 11:57:56 2005  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): Changed the test from

          if (port_number < 0)

          to

          if (port_number == -1)

          to work around problems when (port_number & 0x80 != 0).  Thanks
          to Vemund Handeland <vemund.handeland@fantoft.no> for reporting
          this.
