        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Enabled the Exposed_Policies test on Linux.

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Added a !NO_IFR configuration to each IFR related test.
          The IFR_Service will not run on MacOS X unless TAO is built
          statically due to gcc's in ability to deal with template
          instantiated singletons correctly.

          Added a NO_LOADAVG configuration to avoid running the load average
          based test on platforms that do not have support for obtaining the
          load average from the system.

          Added a configuration for NO_MCAST for machines that do not have
          multicast capabilities or the multicast implementation is broken.

          Added !STATIC to two LoadManager tests to support static builds on
          Windows.

          only when it is not set yet. Also set some variables using ?= so
          that our users can easily define their own values.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
          Disable warning 1572 (floating point warning), correct name of Qt
          library and only set several variables when they are not set yet

Mon May 16 09:01:07 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Conn_Test.cpp:

          Force this test to use threads (instead of fork) on MacOS X.

        * tests/FIFO_Test.cpp:

          Sleep 1 second (as is done on AIX and HP-UX) before attempting to
          receive from the fifo.

        * tests/MT_Reference_Counted_Event_Handler_Test.cpp:

          Set global_event_loop_thread_variable before activating the thread
          that may use it.

        * tests/Naming_Test.cpp:

          Allow the user to determine the location of the context file by
          the TMPDIR, TEMP and TMP environment variables.

        * tests/Pipe_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Use the value from argv[0] instead of hardcoding the exe name.
          The hardcoded name does not work on Windows Release builds.

        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.cpp:

          Use threads by default on HP-UX instead of fork.
          Added a timeout for the recv() call in
          Counting_Service::handle_input() for HP-UX only.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Added a configuration for NO_MCAST for machines that do not have
          multicast capabilities or the multicast implementation is broken.

        * tests/SSL/aix_hack_for_main.cpp:
        * tests/aix_hack_for_main.cpp:

          Removed these files.  They are no longer needed due to MPC.

Mon May 16 08:52:11 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/crosscompile.mpb:

          Added lib_warning, require_warning and avoid_warning to the list
          of targets in the CROSS-COMPILE portion.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcorbaevent.mpb:

          The RTCORBAEvent library requires the CosNaming library.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Support the MPC feature that will allow users to specify arbitrary
          input file dependencies.

          Changed the OBJS setting to use $(notdir) only if the source file
          contains ../ and added explicit rules for source files that are
          located in subdirectories.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_macosx_panther.GNU:

          Explicitly default the threads variable to threads=1.  This
          was preventing ACE_TMCast from building.
          Change the optimization option to -O2.  -O3 was causing some
          link problems in the IDL compiler.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:

          Allow users to override the inline and exceptions settings.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.5.x.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:

          Provide better support for building for VxWorks on a Windows host
          without Cygwin.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Changed the SHOBJS setting to be consistent with the OBJS setting.
          Also, removed VLOBJS and SHOBJS1 which were redundant and set
          exactly as SHOBJS was.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Set ec_typed_events to 1 by default.  This matches the default for
          MPC features.

        * bin/pch_cmd.pl:

          Removed this file.  It is no longer necessary.

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-common.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:

          Put ACE_LIB_TEXT around all ACE_CC_NAME definitions to support
          wide character builds on Solaris, QNX and IRIX.

        * ace/ACE_export.h:

          Added support for SunCC 5.6.

        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.h:
        * ace/Multihomed_INET_Addr.cpp:

          Added an explicit constructor that takes a const char* for
          symmetry with the ACE_INET_Addr class.

        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:

          Removed a bug workaround for aCC A.03.04.  It is no longer a
          problem to specify other mmap base addresses when running
          64-bit HP-UX applications.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
        * ace/config-macosx-panther.h:
        * ace/Sched_Params.cpp:

          MacOS X has pthread_getschedparam but has the ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED
          macro defined.  I have added a new macro,
          ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SCHEDPARAM, that can be defined to use
          pthread_getschedparam and pthread_setschedparam even when
          ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED is defined.


        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Fixed an issue that arose within the static builds on Windows.
          The ACE_Thread_Mutex static data member of the
          TSS_Cleanup_Instance class was being used (in the
          TSS_Cleanup_Instance constructor) before it was statically
          initialized.  I have switched it (and the condition variable
          associated with it) to a pointer that is allocated the first time
          into the TSS_Cleanup_Instance constructor.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp:

          Committing a change from Justin Michel <michel_j@ociweb.com>.
          The close() method failed to unregister the reactor on Windows.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Removed an unnecessary 'install' setting.

        * ace/config-sunos5.10.h:

          SunOS 5.10 has scandir (ACE_HAS_SCANDIR).

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_socket.h:

          When using LKSCTP, include <netinet/in.h> before <netinet/sctp.h>
          to avoid macro problems.

Sun May 15 11:57:56 2005  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set): Changed the test from

          if (port_number < 0)

          to

          if (port_number == -1)

          to work around problems when (port_number & 0x80 != 0).  Thanks
          to Vemund Handeland <vemund.handeland@fantoft.no> for reporting
          this.
