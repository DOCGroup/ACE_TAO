        * ace/OS.{cpp, h, i}
          ace/Signal.cpp
          ace/Synch.cpp
          ace/config-psos-diab-ppc.h: Added support for native mutexs,
          condition variables, and thread-specific storage in pSOS.  Native
          pSOS mutexes, where available, support several cool features, 
          including lock recursion and priority inheritance protocol and
          priority ceiling protocol support.
