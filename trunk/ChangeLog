Wed Apr 26 07:21:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.5.x.GNU:
          Increased template-depth to 50, hopefully this is large enough to
          also build CIAO

Tue Apr 25 16:44:04 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          Added code to support rewinding the output CDR to some previous
          location and updating a value there. This is required to support
          marshaling offset values were the target of the offset is not
          known until the final offset target is actually reached.

Tue Apr 25 13:50:12 UTC 2006  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Signal_Test.cpp:
          Fixed this test for (modern) Linux and Solaris at least.
          The crux is blocking signals before calling sigwait() when doing
          synchronous signal handling.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:
          Always use bool for Boolean, see bugzilla 2514 for more info

Tue Apr 25 06:33:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:
          Put back ACE_TSS_CLEANUP_NAME that got lost by accident with the
          vc6 cleanup. Thanks to Olli Savia for reporting this.

Mon Apr 24 17:39:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

         Merge from ARMS Escher repository.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp

          Updated sched_params() to not ignore the process id passed in.
          Also enhanced the Windows implementation to get a handle to the
          process specified before applying the priority class changes.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp
        * ace/Process_Manager.h

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Removed setting of ACE_ANY_OPS_USE_NAMESPACE again. This causes
          problems when building CIAO. Thanks to Jeff Parsons for finding
          this.

Thu Apr 20 11:46:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:
          Use -shared instead of -G when building shared libraries. Thanks to
          Alan L Batongbacal <alanlb at vt dot edu> for reporting this. This
          fixes bugzilla bug 1848.

Wed Apr 19 12:11:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.rc:
          Removed msvc specific lines

          2495

          Doxygen improvements

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
          Use prefix increment, initialise pointers with 0 and don't print
          an error message when we can't a dll, this gives false messages
          when using TAO. This fixes bugzilla 2383. Thanks to Ming Xiong
          for making a patch.

          bugzilla 2179.

        Only copy the filename to the ACE_Mem_Map::filename_ member
        if the call to open() succeeds.

        * ace/PI_Malloc.h (ACE_Malloc_Header):

        Added missing private and undefined copy constructor.  The

        Wed Mar 29 14:51:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
        Solaris 8 and newer also support sendfile. It seems HPUX also
        supports it but with a different signature and semantics, so just
        don't try it there yet.

        Wed Mar 29 13:06:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
