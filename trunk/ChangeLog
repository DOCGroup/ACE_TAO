	* examples/DLL/test_dll.cpp: Renamed the DLLs and removed the "./"
	  from the pathname.  Thanks to Sam and Roopa for reporting this
 	  and tracking it down, respectively.

Sat May  6 10:23:13 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Add -lrt -laio to
          the LIBS. The Proactor framework needs this; I'm not sure why it
          never showed up until static builds were run.

Tue Apr 25 10:22:16 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cse.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS_NS_string.cpp (strerror): Do a sanity check to make sure
	  errnum >= 0 and < _sys_nerr and set errno to EINVAL if things
 	  are not sane.  Thanks to Aleksandar Vukajlovic <vukajlo at
 	  finsoft dot co dot yu> for this fix.

          Added a compile time check that ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_BUFSIZE must be
          defined to a value bigger then 0, it is 0 we get in a never ending
          loop in the CDR code

Thu May  4 08:50:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        Reverted the change below, broke the sendfile test and Steve
        Huston changed things in such a way that sendfile is only
        used on Solaris 9 and newer

        Tue May  2 09:34:54 Pacific Daylight Time 2006    <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>
        * ace/OS_NS_sys_sendfile.inl (sendfile):
          Removed "::" global scope qualifier from platform sendfile()
          call.  It caused problem on Solaris 8.  Thanks to Simon Massey
          and Johnny Willemsen for analyzing the problem and suggesting
          this fix.

Thu May  4 08:36:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:

Thu May  4 00:43:32 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Add Dynamic_Service_Dependency.{cpp,h} to appropriate lists.

Wed May  3 16:02:10 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fixed a problem due to an attempt to access current_ before it
          has been initialized (a static ACE_TSS instance). The current_
          is now just a pointer to an ACE_TSS instance, which gets
          dynamicaly allocated upon invoking the current() method. The
          deallocation of that instance is left up to the Object Manager
          with which the dynamic ACE_TSS instance is registered.

        * ace/TSS_T.h:

          Added a ACE_TSS_SET () to complete the set of TSS access
          operations, which should work regardless of threading, TSS
          emulation and TSS availability.

Wed May  3 11:52:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Mem_Map.inl:
          Small const improvements

Wed May  3 10:39:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Mem_Map.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Made close_handle_ a bool

Wed May  3 08:56:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Removed support for KCC

Wed May  3 08:14:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_sendfile.h:
          Export sendfile_emulation to resolve link problems in the
          windows builds

Wed May  3 03:36:23 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Moved the ACE_BEGIN_VERSIONED_NAMESPACE_DECL macro to include
          ace_yyparse.

Tue May  2 09:34:54 Pacific Daylight Time 2006    <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_sendfile.inl (sendfile):

          Removed "::" global scope qualifier from platform sendfile()
          call.  It caused problem on Solaris 8.  Thanks to Simon Massey
          and Johnny Willemsen for analyzing the problem and suggesting
          this fix.

Tue May  2 10:34:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_GETCWD, ACE_LACKS_ASCTIME, ACE_LACKS_ASCTIME_R,
          ACE_LACKS_GMTIME, ACE_LACKS_GMTIME_R, ACE_LACKS_LOCALTIME and
          ACE_LACKS_STRFTIME. These macros are new and will be used soon
          in the ACE_OS layer.

Mon May  1 19:49:45 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ARGV.{h i cpp}: Filled out more of the documentation in this
          class, specifically mentioning that the class will enforce the
          "whitespace separates tokens, except when quoted" rule of command
          line parsing that's consistent with ACE_Get_Opt, etc. Also removed
          documentation of non-existant restrictions such as after using
          add(), can't use buf().
          Removed the State enum since the only value ever used was ITERATIVE,
          and changed "int state_" to "bool iterative_" (and removed the
          state() accessor). Changed substitute_env_args_ from int to bool.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.{h cpp} (argv_to_string, string_to_argv): Changed
          the substitute_env_args parameter from "int" to "bool" to better
          reflect what it is, a yes/no indicator.

Mon May  1 06:53:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:

Sun Apr 30 04:21:37 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
          What I meant to commit last time.

Sun Apr 30 02:21:16 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
          Eliminating more warnings from the scoreboard. I'm not sure the
          best way to add this patch to ace/svcconf.mpb, since it affects
          more than just gnuace targets. The easiest would be to store the
          diff between this commit and the previous version and run patch,
          but I'm not sure how to integrate that solution.

Sat Apr 29 13:58:28 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
          More fuzz cleanup.

Sat Apr 29 13:17:24 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
          Fuzz cleanup.

        * THANKS:
          Added credits.

Fri Apr 28 22:31:52 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Removed an ';' after ACE_TRACE, which was confusing GCC4 with
          "hidden visibility" enabled.

Fri Apr 28 21:22:53 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          More re-formatting to weed out those pesky tabs.

Fri Apr 28 20:57:19 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.9.h: Moved ACE_HAS_SENDFILE from Solaris 8 to
          Solaris 9. Solaris 8 supports sendfilev[64] but not sendfile,
          at least not without some patches I don't know about.

Fri Apr 28 20:13:41 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU:
          Solaris 9 puts sendfile() is a separate library, so LIBS needs
          -lsendfile on Solaris 9.

Fri Apr 28 18:03:11 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

Fri Apr 28 15:48:25 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (open_i): ACE_DEFAULT_SVC_CONF shouldn't
          be enclosed in ACE_LIB_TEXT since it's defined in terms of
          ACE_LIB_TEXT already.

Fri Apr 28 15:49:21 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Cleaned up the long-lines of the UNIMPLEMENTED functions.

Fri Apr 28 15:26:53 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.h: Clarified the use and restrictions with

Fri Apr 28 14:54:04 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-macros.h: HP aC++ needs to see the statement in
          ACE_NOTREACHED up to the version 6 series (Integrity). Also see
          Tue Apr 11 13:12:36 UTC 2006  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

Fri Apr 28 14:31:48 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h: Removed extraneous ';' from
          ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC usage.

        * m4/ace.m4: Fixed incorrect variable referenced in case during
          --enable-uses-wchar.

Fri Apr 28 14:03:50 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.h:
        * ace/Parse_Node.h:

          Fixed the usage of ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC to remove the trailing
          semicolon. It was causing build errors on compilers that define
          the macro as empty.

Fri Apr 28 13:55:01 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

Fri Apr 28 13:29:08 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Updated the conditions for running the ORB-specific service
          repository tests.

Fri Apr 28 13:23:57 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:

          Updated the declaration of current_ to match the definition in
          its use of ACE_TSS_TYPE macro, as they are not equivalent for
          a single-threaded builds.

Fri Apr 28 13:21:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:
          When spawn fails log an error and exit instead of using an assert

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Added __SIGNED_INT_TIME_T so that we get a signed time_t that
          matches the POSIX spec that ACE expects.

Fri Apr 28 12:23:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Thu Apr 27 21:04:08 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_Memory.h: Allow configs to set ACE_bad_alloc to avoid
          extending the if-elif chain here further.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h: Regardless of MSVC version, MFC changes
          operator new to throw CMemoryException on out-of-memory condition.
          Version-specific settings still control the setting of
          ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW. Thanks to Mohit Kapoor <Mohit dot Kapoor at
          siemens dot com> for this fix.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp (handle_error): HACK ALERT! Some Linux
          kernels will return from select() with an "invalid" errno value,
          ERESTARTNOHAND, when compiled with profiling enabled. This works
          around the problem. This is a known kernel bug; see Red Hat Bugzilla

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Fixed fuzz complaint about #include inside a versioned namespace
          in Svc_Conf_y.cpp. It was due to a code that Bison generates a
          part of the parser, from Svc_Conf.y. Changed the versioned
          namespace to encloses the non-generated code only, while the
          rest of the parser seems to be designed so that multiple parses
          can coexist without name clashes.

          Correcting a build problem, caused by the extraneous semicolons

Wed Apr 26 20:21:49 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          The motivation for these changes was to enable support in ACE
          for multiple instances of Service Configuration Repository, or
          more appropriately - "Gestalt" (from the German word, meaning
          something that's more than the sum of its parts).  This is
          feature is necessary to enable support for ORB-specific, or more
          generally - service-specific sets of services, i.e. to be able
          to have dynamically loaded services to use their own private set
          of service objects. In the context of the implementation I will
          use "gestalt" as a synonym for service configuration context or
          service configuration repository.

          In order to accomplish this, the "instance"-related
          functionality of the former ACE_Service_Config class has been
          moved to another class - ACE_Service_Gestalt. The
          ACE_Service_Config retains all static interfaces and those
          members, pertaining to the concept of process-wide configuration
          state. The service config, as known today has been retained as a
          concept, but in its specialized semantics as holding a
          process-wide configuration state. The primary concept expressing
          an instance of configuration context is the gestalt. The
          implementation actually uses a specialization of
          ACE_Service_Gestalt in order to implement ACE_Service_Config as
          a singleton, special case of configuration context.

          The static methods in ACE_Service_Config provide access to
          process-wide gestalt (ubergestalt, anyone?) instance.

          For more details, here is the history of all included changes,
          with their motivation and explanation. It is ordered
          alphabetically, by the names of the changed files:

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added to the condition evaluating ACE::debug() to include a
          check if environmental variable ACE_DEBUG has been set.

          Updated the debug() function to call getenv() only once by using
          a method-local static variable to hold the value from the
          environment.

        * ace/DLL.h:
        * ace/DLL.cpp:

          Implemented an operator=, needed in order to implement the
          ACE_Service_Configuration_Guard class.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:

          Improved the error diagnostics so that a "file not found" would
          not mask a "symbol not defined" error when loading a DLL.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.h:

          "Privatized" copy ctor and operator= for ACE_Dynamic_Service
          objects since it is not designed for such operations.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.inl:

          Added overloaded method instance() for ACE_ANTI_TCHAR.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.cpp:

          Changes to enable instantiation of a service, based on the
          registration in a particular service repository. Adding a method
          that takes ACE_Service_Gestalt* additional parameter.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.h:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:

          Factored out a find_i() method to be used by the friend
          ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency class. It implements the specific
          lookup policy that extends the search to the global repository
          if the named service object can not be found locally.

          Added instance method, allowing the caller to explicitly specify
          the gestalt.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.h:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.inl:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.cpp:

          A newly introduced class, whose instances are designed to be
          embedded inside instances of other classes, typically created by
          DLL-based factories (service objects). This provides a way to
          declare dependency on a specific service, thus avoiding order of
          initialization issues with objects whose implementation code
          resides in dynamically loaded services.

          It is disastrous to have dynamically loadable services create
          and give away ownership of objects and then be unloaded before
          all those instances have been deleted. Normally the code for
          such objects classes resides within the TEXT segment of the DLL,
          which implements the service. If a service gets removed, its DLL
          may be unmapped from memory and then any attempt to invoke a
          method on the said objects will cause SEGV.

          Such instances must contain a member of
          ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency initialized with the service they
          depend on. @code ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency's constructor
          and destructor are "magical" - they work by maintaining the
          underlying dynamic service's DLL reference count.

          The problem was not present before because the one Service
          Repository outlived any other user objects. Now that an
          un-loadable service can own its configuration, the sequence of
          service finalization has been reversed.

          Updated the implementation of ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency
          class to ease debugging. ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency gets
          initialized whenever a dependent service gets loaded, to help us
          keep our access to dependent instances after their DLL is gone
          (by upping the ref count on the DLL).

          Updated usage of gestalt's instance() to current(). Removed
          unnecessary comments.

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:

          Changed the ACE_STATIC_SVC_DEFINE to use the new
          ACE_Service_Config::insert () method, which allows to streamline
          the Service Configuration interface and promote hiding the
          storage used for the static service descriptors.

        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:

          Changes to aid in keeping track of the gestalt, while deep in
          the guts of the svc.conf parser.

          Replaced the ACE_Service_Gestalt & in the method signatures with
          ACE_Service_Gestalt * to unify the interfaces.

          Updated the static function node's logic to use only
          ACE_Service_Gestalt public members and to no longer rely on
          knowledge about the internal storage representation of service
          repository.

          Removed a static_cast<> in ACE_Static_Function_Node::symbol()
          that was causing problems on some platforms. It was not even
          necessary as both sides were of the same type.

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,inl,cpp}:

          This separates the responsibilities between the service gestalt,
          which represents an _instance_ of configuration information, and
          the service config, which represents a special, process-wide,
          global configuration repository. Since both these entities
          represent the same concept - service configuration state, but
          from different aspects, the ACE_Service_Config now inherits
          (publicly) from ACE_Service_Gestalt.

          Lots of instance-related code moved to ACE_Service_Gestalt
          Replaced the use of char with ACE_ANTI_TCHAR and the appropriate
          ACE_TEXT_* macros.

          Moved the parsing of command-line options, pertaining to the
          process as a whole, here - in the parse_args_i () (protected,
          virtual).

          In order to resolve a problem caused by the inability of a
          dependent static service to determine which gestalt they need to
          register with, the concept of "current" was separated from the
          "global" gestalt. The current gestalt is pointed to by a
          pointer, stored in thread-specific storage (TSS) and manipulated
          by the ACE_Service_Config_Guard class that implements the
          "resource acquisition is initialization" idiom.

          Fixed an error in the separation of responsibilities between the
          instance gestalt and the global (ubergestalt), during
          initialization.  The bug can cause infinite recursion, when
          initializing an ORB, housed in a dynamic service. The singleton
          gestalt (i.e. ACE_Service_Config) must be initialized through
          open_i(), before open_i() can proceed initializing the specific
          gestalt instance. The difficulty is in that some use cases
          reverse the order of initialization by calling
          ACE_Service_Config::open () first and then, at some point call
          the instance gestalt open_i(). The solution is to use the
          is_initialized_ member together with an explicit call to
          ACE_Service_Config::global()->open_i().  To ease debugging of
          the process of registering static service, I have changes the
          ACE_Service_Config::static_svcs() to return
          ACE_Service_Gestalt::instance (), instead. Thus all the
          ACE_STATIC_SVC* macros are still working (no need to change
          existing code), but now there is a convenient place to debug -
          see the newly added ACE_Service_Gestalt::insert () method.  The
          header file no longer declares ACE_STATIC_SVCS,
          ACE_STATIC_SVCS_ITERATOR, ACE_SVC_QUEUE and
          ACE_SVC_QUEUE_ITERATOR. Those are now protected typedefs in
          ACE_Service_Gestalt, where they are actually used.

          Added new insert () method to use instead of the sequence
          static_svc ()->insert () which unnecessary exposes the internal
          storage structure of Service Configurator.  Made no_static_svcs_
          an instance member, instead of a class (static) member, thus
          providing for ability to set it per instance, not globally.

          Added default values for open_i() and declared private copy ctor
          and assignment operator for ACE_Service_Config_Guard, since it
          is not intended to be copied.

          Similarly, moved the parts of the open_i() functionality that
          did not belong in every instance of the gestalt.
          ACE_Service_Config is again a process-wide Singleton,registered
          with ACE_Object_Manager.

          Eliminated old #if 0-ed code in Service_Config.cpp.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.inl:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Encapsulates the idea of Service Configuration repository, or
          configuration context.

          Changed open_i to be able to detect if it is working on the
          special, process-wide instance (ubergestalt) or a "plain"
          gestalt instance, since there are things that must only be done
          once per process - like signal handler, logging key and
          daemon-ization of the whole process.

          Added an ignore_static_svcs parameter to
          ACE_Service_Gestalt::open_i in order to preserve the prior
          behavior of the singleton ACE_Service_Gestalt instance. Even
          though its no_static_svcs_ member was being initialized with 1,
          some clients (TAO) needs to be able to override it. Since now a
          call to open_i on an instance gestalt may precede in time the
          call to open_i on the ubergestalt, we need a mechanism to allow
          the no_static_svcs_ value to be overridden.

          Added the insert()'s implementation (described above).  Added a
          singleton() method to return the process-wide gestalt singleton
          (or ubergestalt?:). Used in open_i() to account for the fact
          that now a Service Gestalt may be called to open () prior to
          open () on the singleton instance, which would typically contain
          the bulk of the static service object descriptors.

          There was a problem with "hybrid" service objects, i.e. dynamic
          SO which contains static SO (dependent services).  The dependent
          services are typically registered via static ctor or static
          initializer at the point of loading of the dynamic SO's DLL.  As
          such, they end up registering before the dynamic SO.  Upon
          finalization of the service repository, the dynamic SO is
          finalized first, thus unloading its DLL and unmapping the TEXT
          segment, where the dependent static services code is.  When
          next, the static SO is to be finalized its memory is no longer
          at valid address.  The change ensures the dynamic service is
          registered *before* its dependent static services and will
          therefore be finalized last.  The solution is based upon the
          concept of forward declaring a dynamic service, named after the
          configuration file being processed.  Before processing a file,
          we simply check for an existing service with the same name and
          "pass" if we find one.

          Fixed the ACE_Service_Config_Guard's detection of the case where
          the forward service declaration was not replaced by a proper
          declaration as expected. It now properly removes the forward
          decl, not the "good" instance.

          Cleared up the TSS management issue, causing executable to crash
          on startup. The problem was due to an order-of-instantiation
          issue, involving the TSS-based pointer to the current
          gestalt. Used ACE_Object_Manager's shutting_down and starting_up
          methods to determine if it is safe to use the static ACE_TSS
          instance.

          Added const-ness for find().  Removed prototypes for initialize,
          resume, suspend and remove that used plain char type and
          conditionally compiled in only for WinCE and
          ACE_USES_WCHAR. Service_Config still declares and defines these
          (using ACE_ANTI_TCHAR). Updated to resolve problems when built
          with ACE_USES_WCHAR.

          Declared private copy ctor and assignment operator for
          ACE_Service_Gestalt and ACE_Service_Type_Factory, since their
          instances are not intended to be copied.  Added an
          ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC macro for the copy-ctor and assignment
          operator of ACE_Service_Type_Factory.

          Reorganized to streamline the header file and remove unnecessary
          declarations and to add a decl for find_static_svc_descriptor().

          Changed the open() method's implementation to incorporate the
          additional parameter for open_i().

          Added the new find_static_svc_descriptor() member, which allows
          ACE_Static_Function_Node to not need to know how the static
          services are registered in the service repository.

        * ace/Service_Object.h:
        * ace/Service_Object.inl:
        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:

          Exposed the dll_ member through dll () const method because the
          reference is needed by the new ACE_Dynamic_Service_Dependency
          class. Fixed the dump () method.

        * ace/Service_Repository.h:
        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:

          Added const-ness for the find* () methods. Added debugging.  The
          remove method changes the order of services registrations in the
          repository, which may break the Service Repository's invariant,
          imposed by the need to correctly finalize dynamic services with
          their own static services.

          For example, consider a case where a static service (S0) is
          registered in the repository. Then a DLL-based service (D1)
          registers its own static service (S1). So far the order is
          "finalization-compatible": S0 < D1 < S1, i.e. services will be
          finalized in reverse order and D1's DLL will still be available
          when finalizing S1.  Now let's remove (S0). Currently, after
          this operation the repository end up in this order: S1 < D1,
          which is trivially not finalization-compatible.

          Instead of replacing the pointer with the last ptr to a svc in
          the array (repository) and then decrementing the current size of
          the repo, the solution actually shifts left the rest of the
          array.

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:
        * ace/Shared_Object.cpp:

          Removed some and updated existing debug statements. Eliminated
          dead partial instantiation code.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Changed to allow propagation of the knowledge about which
          gestalt is currently being used for service registrations.

          Factored the ACE_Svc_Conf_Param class out in its own translation
          unit.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Param.h:

          Replaced the ACE_Service_Gestalt & in the method signatures with
          ACE_Service_Gestalt *

        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Updated the svcconf.mpb rule to allow building with Bison 2.0
          and up. The change adds #ifdef/#endif around the generated
          header file. A YYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED define is added in order to
          make sure the token declarations from the Svc_Conf_Tokens.h are
          used instead of those generated in the Svc_Conf_y.cpp file.

          Added the new Dynamic_Service_Dependency.* files.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Adding the new tests to the automated test suite to run during
          the nightly builds.

          Applications wishing to use the TAO EndpointPolicy should add
          this base project to their MPC files. This will include
          libTAO_EndpointPolicy in their link lines.

          has been removed now from ACE/TAO. See bugzilla bug 2007

Wed Apr 26 12:02:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/CDR_Test.cpp:
          Boolean is now size 1 or bigger, the marshaling code will take
          care that a Boolean is marshaled as octet of size 1

Wed Apr 26 11:28:28 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.5.x.GNU:
          Increased template-depth to 50, hopefully this is large enough to
          also build CIAO

Tue Apr 25 16:44:04 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
          Added code to support rewinding the output CDR to some previous
          location and updating a value there. This is required to support
          marshaling offset values were the target of the offset is not
          known until the final offset target is actually reached.

Tue Apr 25 13:50:12 UTC 2006  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Signal_Test.cpp:
          Fixed this test for (modern) Linux and Solaris at least.
          The crux is blocking signals before calling sigwait() when doing
          synchronous signal handling.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:
          Always use bool for Boolean, see bugzilla 2514 for more info

Tue Apr 25 06:33:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:
          Put back ACE_TSS_CLEANUP_NAME that got lost by accident with the
          vc6 cleanup. Thanks to Olli Savia for reporting this.

         Merge from ARMS Escher repository.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp

          Updated sched_params() to not ignore the process id passed in.
          Also enhanced the Windows implementation to get a handle to the
          process specified before applying the priority class changes.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp
        * ace/Process_Manager.h

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Removed setting of ACE_ANY_OPS_USE_NAMESPACE again. This causes
          problems when building CIAO. Thanks to Jeff Parsons for finding
          this.

Thu Apr 20 11:46:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:
          Use -shared instead of -G when building shared libraries. Thanks to
          Alan L Batongbacal <alanlb at vt dot edu> for reporting this. This
          fixes bugzilla bug 1848.

Wed Apr 19 12:11:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/ACE_Init_Test.rc:
          Removed msvc specific lines

        * ace/Thread_Mutex.h:
          Doxygen improvements

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
          Use prefix increment, initialise pointers with 0 and don't print

          when using TAO. This fixes bugzilla 2383. Thanks to Ming Xiong
          for making a patch.

        Only copy the filename to the ACE_Mem_Map::filename_ member
        if the call to open() succeeds.

        * ace/PI_Malloc.h (ACE_Malloc_Header):

        Added missing private and undefined copy constructor.  The

        Wed Mar 29 14:51:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
        Solaris 8 and newer also support sendfile. It seems HPUX also
        supports it but with a different signature and semantics, so just
        don't try it there yet.

        Wed Mar 29 13:06:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
