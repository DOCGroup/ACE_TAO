Thu Feb 21 16:33:11 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* docs/tutorials/007: Rename Thread_Pool::open() to Thread_Pool::start() and
	  Thread_Pool::close() to Thread_Pool::stop() and fixed all the
 	  usages.  Also removed the unneeded parameter from stop() and
 	  removed the unneeded re-definition of close() (since we are not
 	  shadowing it any more).  Thanks to Peter Heitman
 	  <pheitman@cisco.com> for reporting this.
	
Thu Feb 21 13:12:44 2002  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_Context.* (ACE_SSL_Context): Added new methods to
	  specify Diffie-Hellman parameters.  These parameters are
 	  required when using DSA certificates/keys.  The new methods are
 	  dh_params, dh_params_file_name, and dh_params_file_type.

Thu Feb 21 09:32:56 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/TTY_IO.cpp (control): Use the appropriate B* macros to set all
	  the baudrate cases.  Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for
 	  contributing this.

	* ace/Signal.cpp (dispatch): Added a cast of (ACE_SignalHandler) to the
	  SIG_DFL parameter so things will work on IRIX 6.5 with GCC
 	  3.0.1.  Thanks to Dan Green <dan.c.green@lmco.com> for reporting
 	  this.

Thu Feb 21 13:09:13 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* ace/streams.h: strstream was deprecated in the 1998 ISO C++
	standard [D.7 depr.str.strstreams], and has been replaced by
	sstream.  Including <strstream> or <strstream.h> causes annoying
	warnings with gcc 3.1.  Since strstream and sstream are not used 
	internally within ACE or TAO, remove includes for strstream, and
	let the developer include them in their own code.

Wed Feb 20 14:18:14 2002  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

	* ace/Process.cpp:
	* ace/Process.h: Added a new method
	ACE_Process_Options::release_handles() to fix the trouble of using
	a pipe as stdout, where the pipe closes completely when the child
	terminates. This method replaces some functionality in the Process
	Options destructor.

Wed Feb 20 13:01:25 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Atomic_Op.i: Fix the return value of the ACE_GUARD_RETURN
	   macros so that if the lock fails, the comparison also fails.
  	  Thanks to Ivan Pia <pia@octet.spb.ru> for reporting this.

Wed Feb 20 17:00:34 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Users who use
	  5.2 and above could use native exceptions with inlining turned
	  on. Thanks to Ken O'Brien <kmobrien@fedex.com> for reporting
	  this problem. 

	* THANKS: Added  Ken O'Brien <kmobrien@fedex.com> to the hall of
	  fame. 

Mon Feb 18 23:17:08 2002  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Makefile.bor:
          Changed library name for the Borland build to be consistent with the
          UNIX build.

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Added macros for the ACEXML Parser library.

        * ACEXML/examples/Makefile.bor:
        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/Makefile.bor:
          Added Borland makefiles for the SAXPrint example.

Mon Feb 18 20:16:27 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Acceptor.cpp (make_svc_handler): 
  	* ace/Connector.cpp (make_svc_handler):  There doesn't seem to be
	  anypoint in *conditionally* assigning the Acceptor/Connector's
 	  reactor to the Svc_Handler, so we'll just assign it...

Mon Feb 18 18:41:33 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

       Integrated the following from the ACE 5.2 stream:

        Wed Feb 13 15:37:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Hash_Cache_Map_Manager_T.h: Added #include "ace/Synch.h" to
          pick up ACE_Null_Mutex.

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp: Added #include "ace/Thread.h" to
          pick up ACE_Thread::self ().

        * tests/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr_Test.h (new file):
        * tests/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr_Test.cpp: Moved definition of Printer
          from .cpp to .h so Visual Age C++ can find it when instantiating
          templates. Also removes the compile warning where the compiler
          warns that the test won't work...

        Tue Feb 12 21:59:42 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Added -qstaticinline
          to CCFLAGS to tell compiler to generate inlined functions with
          static scope instead of extern scope (how stupid is this?).
          Removed error suppression options which should be unnecessary now.

        Sat Feb  9 18:34:59 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv1/Reactive_Logging_Server_Ex.h: Removed an extra
          master_handle_set_.set_bit call. Thanks to Craig Perras
          <craigp@iswnet.com> for reporting this.

        Sat Feb  9 13:49:44 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Hash_Map_With_Allocator_T.h: Added #include "ace/Synch.h" to
          see the definition of ACE_Null_Mutex.

        * ace/config-all.h (ACE_RCSID): Make generated function static to
          keep Visual Age C++ from complaining about the multiple definitions.

        Fri Feb  8 16:20:51 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Removed #define ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE
          for Visual Age C++ 5. As it turns out, wherever the compiler sees
          source and a template is referenced, it generates the template
          class functions used. This is very bad for size as well as for
          situations counting on only one such as ACE_Singleton.

          Also added support for explicit template instantiation with Visual
          Age C++. If the preprocessor define __TEMPINC__ is not defined,
          explicit instantiation is turned on.

        Mon Feb  4 17:21:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Singleton.h (ACE_TSS_Singleton): Added ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNCS
          for assignment and copy ctor methods. This is necessary to allow
          the *_SINGLETON_DECLARE macro, that explicitly instantiates a
          template class on Win32, to compile clean when instantiating an
          ACE_TSS_Singleton class.  Thanks very much to Nanbor Wang for
          direction on solving this problem.

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-6.h: Added ACE_NEEDS_FUNC_DEFINITIONS. This
          avoids warnings when explicitly instantiating an entire class, as
          with ACE_TSS_Singleton and *_SINGLETON_DECLARE, above.


Mon Feb 18 18:23:49 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Reactor.h: Clarified behavior with respect to remaining
          queued notifications when end_reactor_event_loop() is called
          or when the reactor instance is closed/deleted.

Mon Feb 18 19:28:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Made ACE compiling with the Microsoft Visual C++ 7 compiler.
          Template classes cannot be exported when doing a dynamic build, so
          removed some export macro's from template definitions. When a class
          is derived from a class template then the class template must be
          explicit instantiated and be exported. To make sure that we only do
          this when a compiler supports this we introduced the new define
          ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_EXPORT. Also vc++ 7 generates
          now a warning when a class is exported is derived from a class that
          is not exported.

          The following info was given by Microsoft on this:
          The reason that a template can't be exported anymore is that it is
          unlikely that anyone wants to export all specializations of a
          class template. When B is a template and D is a class, the
          construction 'class ACE_Export D : public B<D>' should
          give no problems, but unfornately there is a bug in the vc++
          compiler.

          That's why we now explicit export the template instantations in ace.

Mon Feb 18 11:00:17 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* html/index.html: Added an entry for ACEXML document.

	* ace/OS.h: Removed the extern "C" link designator from the
	  typedef of ACE_Service_Object_Exterminator and the definition of
	  gobbler functions in ACE_FACTORY_DEFINE.  They are not used
	  outside of a DLL so it's okay to have a mangled gobbler name.
	  Thanks to Doug for noticing this.

Mon Feb 18 11:12:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h: Improved Doxygenation of some comments.

Mon Feb 18 10:45:00 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* ace/QoS/QoS_Session_Factory.h:
	  Add new constant ACE_QoS_Session_Factory::ACE_DEFAULT_QOS_SESSION.
	  Give ACE_QoS_Session_Factory::create_session() a default argument
	  of ACE_DEFAULT_QOS_SESSION.

	* ace/QoS/QoS_Session_Factory.cpp:
	  Set the value of ACE_DEFAULT_QOS_SESSION to ACE_RAPI_SESSION on
	  platforms with RAPI RSVP support.  Set it to
	  ACE_GQOS_SESSION on Win32 platforms with GQoS support.
	  Otherwise, issue a compilation error, since these are the only
	  two QoS types supported currently.

	* examples/QOS/Change_Receiver_FlowSpec/receiver.cpp:
	* examples/QOS/Change_Receiver_FlowSpec/sender.cpp:
	* examples/QOS/Change_Sender_TSpec/receiver.cpp:
	* examples/QOS/Change_Sender_TSpec/sender.cpp:
	* examples/QOS/Simple/receiver.cpp:
	* examples/QOS/Simple/sender.cpp:
	  Remove reference to ACE_RAPI_SESSION from invocations of
	  create_session(), leave it empty and choose default argument instead.
	  This will allow the examples to compile and run on Win32.

Mon Feb 18 08:07:59 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* ace/String_Base.{h,i}: Added two new overloaded operators that
	  work on characters.  Thanks to Martin Krumpolec
 	  <krumpolec@asset.sk> for contributing these patches.

Mon Feb 18 13:05:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-all.h:
          Added ACE_NEW_NORETURN macro. This macro is the same as ACE_NEW
          but doesn't do a return when an out of memory error occured so that
          the caller can do extra handling.

        * tests/New_fail_test.cpp:
          Extended this test to test the new ACE_NEW_NORETURN macro.

Mon Feb 18 01:45:07 2002  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/make_flags.bor:
          Added support for Borland C++Builder 6.

Sun Feb 17 16:32:01 2002  Venkita  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.2.2 released.

Sun Feb 17 16:03:03 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* etc/acexml.doxygen: Fixed the output directory name for ACEXML.

Fri Feb 15 10:50:26 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Dynamic_Service.h:
	  Fixed compile error. Added forward declaration for
	  ACE_Service_Object.

Thu Feb 14 19:10:04 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h: Make the rep_ protected rather
	  than private.  Rodney Morris <rodyland@hotmail.com> for
 	  motivating this.

Thu Feb 14 15:26:06 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Dynamic_Service.i (instance): Fixed instance to use an
	  ACE_dynamic_cast() so that the vptr is set correctly.  Thanks to
 	  Bill Dyer <bill.dyer@visogent.com> for suggesting this.

Thu Feb 14 16:15:50 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* COPYING: Updated copyright years.

	* ACEXML/docs/bugs.txt:
	* ACEXML/docs/guidelines.txt: Updated document.

Thu Feb 14 08:17:40 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-all.h: There was a subtle difference between the
	  ACE_NEW based on try/catch and a 0 pointer. The version based on
 	  the fact that new can return 0 always sets the pointer to 0 when
 	  a memory error occured. The version that is based on try/catch
 	  the pointer wasn't set to 0. If the pointer had a different
 	  value, the pointer stays at the old value and wasn't set to 0.
  	  This is now fixed.  Thanks to Peter van Merkerk
 	  <Peter.van.Merkerk@meco.nl> for noticing this and to Johnny
 	  Willemsen for reporting it.

	* ace/Strategies_T.h:
	* ace/Strategies_T.i: Allow the reactor of the Svc Handler to be
	  set to the reactor passed to the Creation Strategy.  Thanks to
 	  David Smith <smithdav@tycoelectronics.com> for motivating this.

Thu Feb 14 01:14:40 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor: Updated ACE_XML_CFLAGS.

Tue Feb 12 20:30:53 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* ace/WIN32_Proactor.cpp (handle_events): When the proactor
	  was called by the reactor in handle_signal() this method should
 	  loop till all events are done. But the loop never got executed
 	  twice because handle_events returned 1 on success and the loop
 	  exits.  To catch more than one notifications handle_events
 	  should be called again.  Even if the loop is executed twice and
 	  no more events are outstanding handle_events should return 0 and
 	  not -1 when calling with timeout 0.  Calling
 	  GetQueuedCompletionStatus with timeout value 0 returns FALSE and
 	  errno "ERROR_SUCCESS".  This check has to be added to
 	  handle_events and 0 has to be returned.  Thanks to Hartmut Quast
 	  <HartmutQuast@t-online.de> for reporting this.

Tue Feb 12 16:18:59 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* TODO: Removed the ACE_USES_HIGH_BAUD_RATES macro since it no longer
	  seems to be necessary.  Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for
 	  reporting this.

	* ace/TTY_IO.cpp: Replaced the two strcmp() calls with one
	  strcasecmp().  Thanks to Olli Savia <ops@iki.fi> for reporting
 	  this.

Sat Feb  9 15:17:45 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/make_release: Changed the path of gv as a new version of GV
	  was installed on deuce.doc. The old version had less colors and
	  it started mapping them to a smaller range. The graphs looked
	  very ugly. The new version fixes the problem and hence a change
	  in path.

Fri Feb  8 22:56:29 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed a warning in TRU 64 builds.

Fri Feb  8 14:54:21 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* apps/JAWS2/Makefile (LDFLAGS):
	* apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/Makefile (LDFLAGS): Fixed some makefile bugs so
	  that this stuff compiles on AIX.  Thanks to Steve Ige
 	  <steve.ige@reuters.com> for reporting this.

Thu Feb  7 18:13:03 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/ACE_Init_Test.cpp (wait_and_kill_dialog): Replaced the call
	  to EndDialog() with EndModalLoop() to fix a race condition.
  	  Thanks to Petru Marginean <petrum@ilx.com> for reporting this.

Fri Feb  8 14:02:06 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* THANKS: Added Marco Kranawetter
	  <Marco.Kranawetter@icn.siemens.de> to the hall of fame.

Fri Feb 08 11:24:36 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/String_Base.h:
	* ace/Task_T.h: Removed the ACE_Export decl from ACE_Task and
	  ACE_String_Base.  They were added as work-aronds for a VC7's
	  internal compiler bug but didn't seem to solve the problem.
	  Thanks to Patrick Bennett <patrickb@inin.com>, Johnny, and
	  Christian Veleba <christian.veleba@porsche.co.at> for reporting
	  this.

Thu Feb  7 16:19:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-all.h: Define new macros, ACE_nothrow and ACE_nothrow_t,
          to decide which variety of nothrow is used in new (nothrow). At
          this point, HP aC++ is the only platform defined to use this
          feature, so that's the only section that defines it.

        * ace/Svc_Handler.(cpp h):
        * examples/Shared_Malloc/test_persistence.cpp: Use the new
          ACE_nothrow[_t] macros in overridden operator new.

Thu Feb  7 14:11:31 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Singleton.cpp (close): Fixed the implementation so that the
	  ACE_Unmanaged_Singleton's internal singleton point is reset to 0
 	  after cleanup to avoid double-deletion.  Thanks to Marc Walrave
 	  <marc.walrave@meco.nl> for this fix.

Thu Feb  7 07:52:47 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Activation_Queue.{h,i}: Added get/set methods to access/update
	  the underlying ACE_Message_Queue so users can call methods on
	  the queue directly if necessary.  Thanks to Timothy Kilbourn
 	  <kilbourn@sep.com> for reporting this.

Tue Feb  5 07:25:49 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp: Improved the comments to clarify the
	  differences between this test and the Thread_Pool_Reactor_Test.cpp.
	  Thanks to Alex Libman for explaining this.

Thu Feb  7 08:16:24 2002  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* ACE-INSTALL.html: Document the include_env=1 make switch.

	* docs/exceptions.html: Replaced the "Transition from TAO_TRY
	  to ACE_TRY" section with "Transition from ACE_TRY_ENV usage
	  to ACE_ENV_ARG".

Wed Feb  6 06:57:35 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/run_test.lst: Disabled TP_Reactor_Test as the test is
	  hanging.

Tue Feb  5 11:59:00 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp (disable_signal): Eliminate unused
	  arguments warning on Win32 platforms.

Mon Feb  4 16:22:20 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* ace/OS.h: Include <new> instead of <new.h> if
	  ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB is defined.

Mon Feb  4 19:58:03 2002  Boris Kolpackov  <bosk@ipmce.ru>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

	  Fixed minor bug in what's just commited before.
	  Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <crodrigu@bbn.com>
	  for pointing it out.

Mon Feb  4 14:11:14 2002  Boris Kolpackov  <bosk@ipmce.ru>

	* ace/Log_Msg.h:
	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

	  Added ability to install custom backend which is a
	  per-process entity as opposite to callback which is
	  a per-thread not-inheritable entity.

Sun Feb  3 17:59:36 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h (ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION):

          Explicitly defined the above macro as this is needed for SunOS
          gcc to work. This was inside a __SUNPRO_CC #ifdef. I missed that
          in my previous change. This should fix the builds under SunOS
          gcc.

Sun Feb  3 18:32:29 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp: Use size_t instead of long
	  and int for index_ and sessions_ in order to eliminate
	  more compiler warnings.

Sun Feb  3 09:20:04 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp: Fixed a bunch of warnings.  Thanks
	  to Venkita for reporting this.

Sun Feb  3 08:22:28 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Makefile:
	  Regenerated makefile to create dependencies for TP_Reactor_Test.

Sun Feb  3 08:05:12 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.dsp (RSC):
	  Regenerated the file in MSVC++.

Sun Feb  3 11:16:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile error in BCB unicode build

Sat Feb  2 07:45:51 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* tests/run_test.lst:
	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.dsp:
	* tests/Makefile.bor:
	* tests/Makefile: Added the TP_Reactor_Test.

	* tests/TP_Reactor_Test.cpp: Added another test of the ACE_TP_Reactor.
	  Thanks to Alex Libman for contributing this.

	* ace/config-irix6.x-common.h: IRIX 6.5 supports AIO, so we'll
	  enable these features.  Thanks to Alex Libman for validating
 	  this.

	* ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp: Fixed work_pending() so that it takes
	  into account pending timers that need to be expired.  Thanks to
 	  Russ Noseworthy for reporting this.

	* ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp: Simplified the logic for calculating
	  timeouts in wait_for_multiple_events().

	* ace/Process.{h,i,cpp}: When using ACE_Process_Options with the
	  inherit_environment set to off, i.e., ACE_Process_Options opts
 	  (0), ACE_Process::spawn() was improperly setting the environment
 	  in the child's process after fork (), before exec ().  Changed
 	  ACE_Process::spawn to check for the inherit_environment flag,
 	  and to use the execve () call instead of execvp () if
 	  inherit_environment is false.  Thanks to James Risinger
 	  <jrisinger@SignalSoftCorp.com> for contributing this fix.

	* ace/Process.{h,i}: Added "const" to the various accessor methods.

Sat Feb  2 00:01:36 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-sunos5.6.h:
	  Added missing #endif.

Fri Feb  1 23:42:03 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-all.h:
	  Removed extra ).

Fri Feb  1 21:08:37 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Framework_Component_Test.icc:
        * tests/Vector_Test.icc: New Visual Age C++ test configurations.

        * tests/tests.icp: Add new test configurations to the project.

Fri Jan  1 19:33:49 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Vector.(h i cpp): Removed 'const' from the 2nd template
          argument (size_T DEFAULT_SIZE). A size_t is always const,
          and having const there causes errors from HP aC++. I'm not sure
          if they're completely legit, but Stroustrup 3rd Ed says the
          template argument is const anyway... if this is a problem,
          please let me know.

Fri Feb  1 18:53:44 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Added Framework_Component.(h cpp) to the files list.

Fri Feb  1 10:19:46 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Thread_Manager.h:

          Removed extra '*/'.

Fri Feb 01 00:00:12 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Task.h:
	* ace/Thread_Manager.h: Added more explanation on how to use the
	  <task> argument.  Thanks to Petr Shelomovsky
	  <pedrodon@trustworks.com> for motivating the change.

Thu Jan 31 19:18:37 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/NT_Service.{h cpp}: To avoid race condition at shutdown time,
          moved the call to report_status(SERVICE_STOPPED, 0) from the
          open() method to a new override of the fini() method. Setting
          status to SERVICE_STOPPED frees up Windows to do its own shutdown
          for the service, and that can't be allowed to commence until all
          ACE_NT_Service things are done. Thanks to Zoran Cetusic
          <ZoranC@inter-intelli.com>, Patrick Bennett and Felix Wyss from
          Interactive Intelligence, Inc. for diagnosing this problem and
          sending in a fix.

        * THANKS: Added Zoran Cetusic, Patrick Bennett, and Felix Wyss to
          the Hall of Fame.

Thu Jan 31 17:00:52 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-all.h: Need to include <new> with all versions of
	  SunCC compiler and not just CC 5.0, when the compiler is using
	  compat mode 4.
	* ace/config-sunos5.6.h: Need to define ACE_LACKS_ACE_IOSTREAM
	  when higher versions of CC are used with compat mode 4 and
	  such.

	  Thanks to Tim Rydell <tim.rydell@gd-ais.com> for the fixes.

	* THANKS: Added Tim Rydell to the hall of fame.

Thu Jan 31 17:21:49 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Trace.cpp (constructor and destructor): Do not attempt
          trace output if ACE has not been initialized. There is too
          much not set up yet to bother trying. If you are on a platform
          with ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER (such as Windows) and you
          really, really need tracing in static objects, you should
          try #define ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER 0  in your config.h
          along with #define ACE_NTRACE 0.  Beware, though, there are
          crocodiles lurking there - platforms defined to use non-static
          object manager are that way for good reason.

          Thank you to Shmulik Regev <shmul@vself.com> for reporting this.

Thu Jan 31 13:32:07 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* XML/common/XML_Common.dsp: Fixed the LIB path to use relative
	  path.

Thu Jan 31 19:18:16 2002  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
	  Corrected placement of the include_env switch.
	  include_env=1 is only sensible in combination with
	  exceptions=1.  NB: The include_env switch is only
	  intended to facilitate transition to the ACE_ENV_ARG
	  macros and should not be used for new applications.
	  There will be unused-variable warnings when using this
	  build configuration.

Thu Jan 31 11:57:07 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* XML/parser/debug_validator/Debug_Attributes_Builder.cpp:
	* XML/parser/debug_validator/Debug_Element_Builder.cpp:
	  Temporarily removed unused arguments.

	* XML/common/FileCharStream.cpp (get): Made sure the character
	  read from the input file was converted to ACEXML_Char type
	  correctly.  Casted the read XML_Char before comparing it to
	  'EOF'.

Thu Jan 31 13:06:12 2002  Boris Kolpackov <bosk@ipmce.ru>

	* THANKS:

	  Added Koushik Banerjee to the hall of fame.

Wed Jan 30 22:41:39 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (CXX_VERSION):

          Made it work when someone wants to turn off the implicit
          template instantiation. Care should be taken to #define
          ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION in config.h also.
          Surprisingly the code compiles without that also...

Wed Jan 30 17:22:49 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.cpp (wait (const ACE_Time_Value&, ACE_exitcode *)):
        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait (pid_t, const ACE_Time_Value&,
                                         ACE_exitcode *)):
          The mechanism for waiting up to a specified time for a child
          process to exit has been replaced. Replaces the fix from:
          Fri Jan 25 19:58:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          and makes unnecessary any further work from:
          Sat Jan 26 21:41:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

          Both classes now do a timed wait for a child by doing an
          ACE_OS::sleep, counting on being interrupted if a SIGCHLD
          is delivered. In ACE_Process_Manager when a reactor hasn't
          been specified, and always in ACE_Process, a temporary
          SIGCHLD handler is installed for the duration of the wait.
          This is necessary because the default SIGCHLD action on
          POSIX (and holds true for most non-Win32) is SIG_IGN, and
          SIGCHLD is not generated when a child process exits.
          Therefore, a handler is installed to force the SIGCHLD.
          It's not needed in ACE_Process_Manager when a reactor is in
          place because the reactor already has a handler for SIGCHLD.

Wed Jan 30 15:11:49 2002  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (CXX_VERSION):
        * ace/config-g++-common.h:

          Turned off explicit template instantiation with gcc under Linux.
          The specific versions are 2.95.x, 2.96, 3.0.x (3.x). Added a
          flag implicit_templates to tweak the behaviour from the
          platform_macros.GNU file.

          The combination of the compiler and binutils seems to give a
          nice reduction in the footprint.

Wed Jan 30 16:00:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (register_handler): Replaced ECHILD with
          EINVAL if the pid is not found. Probably a more accurate
          assessment of the situation, and should compile clean on WinCE.

Wed Jan 30 13:50:17 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* docs/index.html: Fixed the ACE-inheritance.pdf document so
	  it isn't gzipped.  Thanks to Michael Searles
 	  <msearles@base16.com> for reporting this.

Wed Jan 30 09:28:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * XML/parser/debug_validator/Debug_Attributes_Builder.cpp:
        * XML/parser/debug_validator/Debug_DTD_Manager.cpp:
        * XML/parser/debug_validator/Debug_Element_Builder.cpp:
        * XML/parser/debug_validator/Element_Tree.cpp:
          Added missing ACE_LIB_TEXT. This fixes the BCB unicode build errors

Tue Jan 29 20:11:21 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* etc/*.doxygen (EXPAND_AS_DEFINED): Added ACE_CACHE_MAP_MANAGER
	  to the list in EXPAND_AS_DEFINED. Thanks to Don Hinton
	  <dhinton@ieee.org> for the suggestion.

Tue Jan 29 19:36:24 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/make_release: The whole release process has been moved to
	  Linux box. This is because the sun machines at WashU were having
	  problems and they are not dependable. The following are the list
	  of changes made

	  - All the path related stuff have been changed ie. instead of
	    using /pkg/gnu tools, we use native tools on Linux now.

	  - The gnu suffixes to many of the tools have been removed.

	  - Most of the path to the tools have been hardcoded in the PATH
	    environment variabe.

	  - Tools that were missing have been loaded on 3 main Linux boxes
	    at WashU including Graphviz and doxygen.

	  - A beta cannot be cut from a sun box.

	  - The script will recommend cutting a beta from deuce.doc.

	  The script has been tested with a dummy release.

Tue Jan 29 16:01:54 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* bin/fuzz.pl (check_for_missing_rir_env):

	  Check for ACE_ENV_ARG_PARAMETER instead of
	  TAO_ENV_ARG_PARAMETER.  The latter is deprecated.

Tue Jan 29 20:47:24 2002  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* docs/exceptions.html: Document the new ACE_ENV_ macros.

        * bin/subst_env.pl: Transform to ACE_ENV_ instead of TAO_ENV_.

Tue Jan 29 08:39:24 2002  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* ace/CORBA_macros.h:
	  Added ACE_ENV_ARG macros to replace the TAO_ENV_ARG macros
	  defined in TAO/tao/orbconf.h. All exception related macros
	  are now defined in ace/CORBA_macros.h, and the TAO_ENV_ARG
	  macros will soon be deprecated.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
	  Added the include_env switch for compatibility with the
	  exception handling use before TAO 1.2.2.

Tue Jan 29 08:17:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Added compiler flags for new cosevent orbsvcs test library CECTEST
          Added compiler flags for new notify orbsvcs test library NotifyTests

Mon Jan 28 17:44:51 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait): When waiting for a non-specific
          process, specify -1 pid for waitpid(). This is necessary because
          of Fri Jan 25 19:58:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          change to not alter the process group ID when ACE_Process_Manager
          spawns a process.
          Timed waits for a process still don't work on non-Win32, but
          this fix corrects the failed wait with errno == ECHILD.

Mon Jan 28 12:16:28 2002  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst:
	  Removed EC_Basic and Event_Latency tests from nightly builds, I
	  left them there by mistake when I took them out of the
	  repository (around December, 25th 2001)

Mon Jan 28 13:20:32 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* XML/common/AttributesImpl.cpp: Removed a bunch of inline
	  designators.

Sun Jan 27 22:18:50 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl: Projects in XML subdirectory are
	  interdependent.  List out the order they should be built
	  explicitly.

Sun Jan 27 12:48:48 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst
	* bin/performance_stats.sh:

	  Updated in accordance with the new TAO "Latency" performance
	  test organization.

Sun Jan 27 12:08:45 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* XML/common/Transcode.h (ACEXML_Transcoder): Improved the
	  documentation.

	  The followings fixed the Tru64 warnings/errors.

	* XML/common/AttributesImpl.i (operator):
	* XML/common/Env.i: Reordered inline functions.

	* XML/tests/Transcoder_Test.cpp: Removed an unused argument.

	* XML/common/Attributes_Def_Builder.h: Added inclusion of
	  "ace/Auto_Ptr.h".

	* XML/examples/SAXPrint/SAXPrint_Handler.cpp:
	* XML/examples/SAXPrint/Print_Handler.cpp: Added inclusion of
	  "ace/Log_Msg.h".

Sun Jan 27 15:03:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * Makefile.bor:
          Build the XML library with BCB

        * XML/parser/Makefile.bor:
          Added debug_validator

        * XML/parser/debug_validator/Makefile.bor:
          Added BCB makefile

Sat Jan 26 19:02:49 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/Process_Manager.cpp (register_handler):

	  Corrected code that always returned -1.  Code that should only
	  have been run on error was always run since it was outside of an
	  "if block."  Curly braces are a good thing (they were missing).

Sat Jan 26 21:41:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait): Fixed compiler warning on
          Linux about unused wait_until. This fix removes the ability
          to spin around the 'for' loop waiting for signals multiple
          times with the timeout decreasing to account for wait time.
          Will have to come back to restore this functionality later.

Sat Jan 26 14:40:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Added compiler and linker flags for new XML library

        * XML/common/Makefile.bor:
        * XML/parser/parser.Makefile.bor:
        * XML/Makefile.bor:
        * XML/parser/Makefile.bor:
        * XML/tests/Makefile.bor:
          Added BCB makefiles for the new XML library.

Fri Jan 25 19:58:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (wait(pid_t, const ACE_Time_Value &,
          ACE_exitcode *status)): If platform offers sigtimedwait, use it
          instead of setting ualarm and then doing sigwait. Once ualarm
          is set, it will fire, even if this method has returned. This
          causes Solaris processes to die on SIGALRM.

          Also, do not play with the process group ID by default. It's
          not needed for doing normal signal management by most processes.
          If processes really have a need to change or set a new process
          group, they need to do it explicitly by using ACE_OS::setpgid()
          or by setting a process group ID in an ACE_Process_Options object
          when spawning processes.

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp: Added a bit more diagnostic info.

Fri Jan 25 18:29:37 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Removed ACE_HAS_SIGTIMEDWAIT. It compiles,
          but returns ENOSYS at run time.

        * ace/config-aix5.1.h: Added ACE_HAS_SIGTIMEDWAIT.

Fri Jan 25 15:36:40 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace_dll.dsp: Removed /version flags from the project since
	  they have been taken care of by ace.rc file.  Thanks to Ossama
	  for pointing it out.

Fri Jan 25 14:45:00 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst:
	  Added Two_Objects test to the list.

Fri Jan 25 14:40:15 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* XML/common/Exception.cpp:
	* XML/common/NamespaceSupport.cpp:
	* XML/common/SAXExceptions.cpp:
	* XML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp: Moved the initialization of static
	  members before the inclusion of inline files to avoid
	  compilation erros on Borland compiler.  Thanks to Johnny
	  Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for figuring this out.

Fri Jan 25 14:31:06 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* XML/common/NamespaceSupport.cpp:
	* XML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp: Fixed several KCC warnings.

Fri Jan 25 12:01:14 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	  The following changes fixed SunCC5.1 compilation errors.

	* XML/common/Makefile:
	* XML/parser/parser/Makefile:
	* XML/tests/Makefile:
	* XML/examples/SAXPrint/Makefile: Removed extra spaces for -I
	  flags.

	* XML/common/Attributes_Def_Builder.h: Removed a redundant comma.

	* XML/common/NamespaceSupport.i: Changed
	  ACE_TEMPLATE_METHOD_SPECIALIZATION to
	  ACE_TEMPLATE_SPECIALIZATION.

	* XML/tests/NamespaceSupport_Test.cpp: String literals needed to
	  be assigned to const char *.

Fri Jan 25 09:42:12 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/ace_dll.dsp:

	  Corrected inconsistency in the DLL minor version.  The correct
	  minor version for the ACE 5.2 series is "2," not "1."

Fri Jan 25 11:21:28 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/msvc_auto_compile.pl: Added XML into the list of auto build
	  targets.

Fri Jan 25 00:37:00 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* We now have 1,400 contributors to the ACE+TAO software.  Yow!

Thu Jan 24 17:49:46 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/CDR_Stream.i: Fixed the check for the length within
	  ACE_InputCDR::read_*_array (). The method was checking just for
	  length passed in, which happens to be the number of elements in
	  the array, instead of the number of bytes necessary for the
	  elements. Thanks to William R Volz <WRVO@chevrontexaco.com> for
	  reporting this.

	* THANKS: Added William Volz to the hall of fame.

Thu Jan 24 18:31:49 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp: Better diagnostics added.

Thu Jan 24 15:14:52 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Lib_Find.cpp (ldfind): Restored previously removed Win32
	  code and re-organized macros so we wouldn't upset CE builds.

Thu Jan 24 14:53:38 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/generate_doxygen.pl:
	* etc/acexml.doxygen: Added the doxygen config file for XML
	  subdirectory.

	* Makefile: Added XML subdirectory into the lists to be compiled
	  and be included in the release.

	* XML/*: Merged in the XML parser code.

Thu Jan 24 10:14:47 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace_wchar.h: Added the definition for ACE_TEXT_SearchPath.

	* ace/Lib_Find.cpp (ldfind): Fixed UNICODE and Fuzz builds
	  errors.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for
	  the fix.

Wed Jan 23 16:48:54 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Lib_Find.h:
	* ace/Lib_Find.cpp (ldfind): Change to use Win32 API SearchPath to
	  search for the target DLL and updated the document for ldfind in
	  header file.  Thanks to Eugene Alterman
	  <Eugene.Alterman@bremer-inc.com> for submitting the patch.

Wed Jan 23 14:01:32 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/config-lynxos.h (ACE_LACKS_INET_ATON):

	  LynxOS does not implement the inet_aton() function.

Wed Jan 23 16:37:52 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/NT_Service.cpp (insert): If the CreateService call fails,
          be sure to save the error value before making another Win32 call
          that will smash it. Thanks to Kelly Hickel <kfh@mqsoftware.com>
          for reporting this.
          Also ACE-ified the source better.

        * examples/NT_Service/main.cpp: Added some ACE_ERROR output if
          operations requested from the command line fail.

Wed Jan 23 16:14:43 2002  Boris Kolpackov  <bosk@ipmce.ru>

	* include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU

	  Added work around for famous Sun CC "pure virtual function called"
	  bug. Unfortunately this involves introduction of yet another #define.
	  See TAO/tao/ValueBase.h for more information.

Tue Jan 22 21:27:25 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/ace_dll.vcp: Add Frameork_Component.* to the builds. Thanks
	  to Venkita for pointing it out.

Tue Jan 22 17:42:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/NT_Service.(h cpp): Added two new methods:
           void capture_log_msg_attributes (void): Grabs a copy of the
                calling thread's ACE_OS_Log_Msg_Attributes to facilitate
                inheritance of the logging attributes in the service thread.
           void inherit_log_msg_attributes (void): Called in a service
                thread, inherits the main thread's logging attributes.
          Modified the ACE_NT_SERVICE_RUN macro to capture the main
          thread's logging attributes before starting the service control
          dispatcher. Modified the ACE_NT_SERVICE_DEFINE macro to call
          inherit_log_msg_attributes if the ACE_NT_Service object for
          the service was set up before the thread started.
          Fixes Bugzilla # 82.

        * examples/NT_Service/main.cpp:
        * examples/NT_Service/ntsvc.cpp: Now writes a log file in the current
          working directory which should have messages from both main and
          service threads in it.

Tue Jan 22 15:19:29 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/DLL.cpp:  Changed to invoke this->open() in the
	  constructor.  Thanks to Eugene Alterman
	  <Alterman@bremer-inc.com> for motivating this.

Mon Jan 21 23:27:03 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Reordered main redefinition macros so that it actually
	  passed wchar argv to main when UNICODE is defined.

Mon Jan 21 10:01:34 2002  Frank Hunleth  <fhunleth@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst:
	  Added MIOP unit tests.

Mon Jan 21 03:00:14 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/Framework_Component.cpp (register_component):

	  Removed debugging statements that always printed text.

Mon Jan 21 07:45:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

	* ace/Framework_Component.cpp:
          Fixed fuzz error

Mon Jan 21 00:13:42 2002  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ace/streams.h:
          Workaround for Borland C++ 5.5.1 bug we have now just hit.

Sun Jan 20 21:42:53 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Framework_Component.cpp:
	* ace/Framework_Component_T.cpp: Fixed fuzz errors.

2002-01-20  Oliver Kellogg  <oliver.kellogg@sysde.eads.net>

	* bin/subst_env.pl: New script to ease the transition to the
	  TAO_ENV_ARG macros defined in TAO/tao/orbconf.h.

Sun Jan 20 12:38:28 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Framework_Component_Test.dsp: New dsp file for the test.
	* tests/tests.dsw: Added the above test to the workspace.

Sun Jan 20 12:25:28 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Framework_Component.h: Removed the definition of the
	  default constructor (in ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC definition). The
	  other private constructor with a default argument tends towards
	  a default constructor and VC++ signals a multiple definition
	  error. Not sure how g++ didnt signal this one.

	* ace/Framework_Component_T.h: #include'd Framework_Component.h
	* ace/Framework_Component_T.cpp: Added a #ifndef around the file.

	* ace/ace_dll.dsp:
	* ace/ace_lib.dsp: Added the Framwork_Component* files to the
	  project file.

Sun Jan 20 10:40:28 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Vector_Test.dsp:
	* tests/tests.dsw: Added a new project for Vector_Test.

Sun Jan 20 16:25:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Makefile.bor:
          Added new Framework_Component

        * tests/Makefile.bor:
          Added new Framework_Component_Test

Sun Jan 20 00:00:30 2002 UTC  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

	* ace/Vector_T.cpp (dump): Commented out the contents of this
	  function for the time being.  It assumed that the element
	  was an object with a dump() method, which won't always be
	  the case.

	* tests/Vector_Test.cpp: Changed a few data types from signed
	  to unsigned, size_t, to get rid of compiler warnings.

Sat Jan 19 17:29:50 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@siesta.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Vector_T.cpp (dump): Fixed problems with this method.  Thanks
	  to Don Hinton for reporting this.

	* tests/Vector_Test.cpp: Changed the typedef of DATA from int to
	  size_t to avoid "type mismatch" compiler warnings.  Thanks to
 	  Don Hinton for reporting this.

Sat Jan 19 22:30:26 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

	* apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Hash_Bucket_T.h:
	* apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Assoc_Array.h: Added missing keyword "class" to
	  friend declarations.

	* ace/SString.cpp: Removed unneeded include of Service_Config.h.

	* ace/Service_Config.{h|cpp}:
	* examples/Connection/misc/Connection_Handler.cpp:

	  Removed static methods from ACE_Service_Config that delegated to
	  ACE_Reactor::instance(), and fixed a few instances where they were
	  still called.

	* ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
	* ace/Service_Config.cpp:
	* ace/Proactor.cpp:
	* ace/Reactor.cpp:

	  Added call to instance() methods that registers the singleton with
	  the new ACE_Framework_Repository so it can handle destruction, and
	  replaced explicit references to ACE_Reactor and ACE_Proactor with
	  calls to ACE_Framework_Repository.

	* ace/Framework_Component.{h|inl|cpp}:
	* ace/Framework_Component_T.{h|inl|cpp}:
	* ace/Makefile:
	* tests/Framework_Component_Test.cpp:
	* tests/Makefile:
	* tests/run_test.lst:

	  Added ACE_Framework_Repository to manage ACE_Framework_Component's,
	  e.g., singletons like ACE_Reactor or ACE_Proactor.  It uses
	  External Polymorphism obviating any interface changes.  The
	  components register themselves with repository in their instance
	  methods.  This allows the Object_Manager and Service_Config to
	  manage these components without having to know about them a priori.

	  This was needed to reduce footprint for applications like TAO that
	  don't need to use all the available components, e.g., ACE_Proactor.

Sat Jan 19 10:23:39 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Makefile (TEMPLATE_FILES):
	* tests/Makefile.bor:
  	* tests/Makefile:
    	* tests/run_test.lst:
	* ace/Vector_T.{h,i,cpp}:
	* tests/Vector_Test.cpp: Added support for the new ACE_Vector to
	  the appropriate places.  This vector behaves like the STL
 	  vector.  Thanks to Gonzo and Craig Ching for contributing this.

	* ace/Future_Set.h: Updated the documentation to explain how
	  various features work better.  Thanks to Johnny Tucker for
 	  contributing this.

Fri Jan 18 19:09:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Re-enabled Process_Manager_Test for all but
          Chorus and VxWorks. Could not find a reason it was disabled.
          Also enabled Process_Mutex_Test on Win32.

Fri Jan 18 16:44:29 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Added Reactor_Notification_Strategy.(h cpp) sources.

        * ace/Reactor_Notification_Strategy.cpp: Fixed ACE_RCSID to refer to
          Reactor_Notification_Strategy, not Strategies.

        * tests/Get_Opt_Test.icc:
        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.icc: New Visual Age C++ configs for these tests.

        * tests/tests.icp: Added Get_Opt_Test.icc and INET_Addr_Test.icc

Fri Jan 18 12:56:36 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Log_Msg.cpp (init_backend): Added support for SysLog on platforms
	  that don't lack it.  Thanks to Alexei I. Adamovich
 	  <lexa@adam.botik.ru> for reporting this fix.

Fri Jan 18 10:29:06 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/Service_Config.h (process_file):
	* ace/Service_Config.cpp (process_directives, process_file):

	  Factored out code that processes a svc.conf file into the new
	  static process_file() method.  This allows svc.conf files to be
	  explicitly parsed by the application at any arbitrary point in
	  time instead of Service Configuration initialization time alone.

Thu Jan 17 18:51:09 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Name_Space.cpp (operator =): Fixed a memory leak.  Thanks
	  to Ian Cahoon <icahoon@cisco.com> for reporting this.

Thu Jan 17 12:13:51 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_Context.h (private_key, verify_private_key):

	  Added new documentation.  These methods should only be called
	  after a certificate has been set since key verification is
	  performed against the certificate, among other things.

Thu Jan 17 13:11:27 2002  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Message_Queue.h:
        * ace/Message_Queue.cpp:
        * ace/Message_Queue_T.h:
        * ace/Message_Queue_T.cpp:

          Provide the ability to enqueue based on the message deadline and
          to dequeue based on priority, deadline and from the end.

Wed Jan 16 11:24:52 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ece.uci.edu>

	* THANKS:
	  Updated to add Gerhard Voss <Gerhard_Voss@t-online.de>.

Wed Jan 16 06:19:01 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@siesta.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i: Replaced "set" with "sset" in sigtimedwait() and sigwait()
	  to avoid STL symbol clashes with MSVC++ 6.0.  Thanks to Shmulik
 	  Regev <shmul@vself.com> for reporting this.

Wed Jan 16 09:01:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Containers_T.{h,cpp}:
          Added ACE_Fixed_Set_Const_Iterator to make it possible to
          iterate through a const ACE_Fixed_Set instance

Wed Jan 16 07:53:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Added new flags for the new TAO ETCL orbsvcs library

Tue Jan 15 17:24:53 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp (report_error()): Set ACE_OS::last_error()
          to ERR_get_error() so the caller can get the error code later.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp: If the SSL handshake phase of a
          connection attempt fails, close the underlying socket.

Tue Jan 15 15:35:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Connector.(h cpp):
        * ace/LSOCK_Connector.(h i cpp):
        * ace/MEM_Connector.(h cpp):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.(h cpp):
          Improved the Doxygenation and removed the protocol_family and
          protocol arguments from the ctors and connect() methods. The
          protocol family is always taken from the ACE_Addr remote_sap
          argument since it can now be either PF_INET or PF_INET6 (for
          SOCK_Connector objects) and should be PF_UNIX for LSOCKs.
          It is pointless to allow the user to request something that
          is impossible to do correctly.

Tue Jan 15 10:52:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Added new flags for the new TAO PortableGroup library

Mon Jan 14 14:40:25 2002  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* bin/g++dep:
	  Fixed small problems in the dependency generation:
	  - The script did not properly handle files with '+' in their
	    names.
	  - In some cases the script generated escaped blanks, i.e. lines
	    containing a blank preceded by a backslash.  Such blanks are
	    interpreted as part of a dependency name and break havoc with
	    the builds.

Mon Jan 14 16:49:37 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_STATIC_SVC_DEFINE): Corrected the documentation to
          say the service-implementing class must be derived from
          ACE_Service_Object, not ACE_Service_Config.

Mon Jan 14 07:40:16 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (mmap): There was a typo that prevented the ACE Memory Map
	  stuff from working properly on Win9x.  Thanks to Edan Ayal
 	  <edanayal@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 13 18:59:37 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Memory_Pool.{h,cpp}: Added a new option that makes is possible
	  to control whether or not a fixed address will be used when
 	  remapping a memory-mapped file.  Thanks to Jonathan Reis
 	  <reis@stentor.com> for this enhancement.

Mon Jan 14 11:02:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          Added flags for new TAO FT_ORB library

Sun Jan 13 08:20:05 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* ace/config-all.h: Make sure that ACE_bad_alloc
	  is defined as std::bad_alloc if
	  ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB macro is set.
	  Fixes gcc 3.0.3 compilation problem.

Fri Jan 11 22:54:22 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/config-lynxos.h: Added #define ACE_HAS_USING_KEYWORD to teh
	  file.  The compiler supports namespaces. According to the new
	  rules at the doc_group, we dont use any compilers that dont
	  support namespaces. The above macro is itself a waste. But we
	  cannot remove it overnight as it has far reaching
	  consequences. Working around that for the timebeing.

Thu Jan 10 18:35:41 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Profile_Timer.h: Clarified that elapsed_time() calculates time
          from start() to stop(). Improved Doxygenation.

Thu Jan 10 16:53:41 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/server.dsp: The
	  Release version of the library needs to link in ADVAPI32.LIB as
	  GetUserName is used in ACE's inline code.

Wed Jan  9 22:07:50 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp (fini): Make sure to cancel the
	  timer if interval_ and max_size_ are > 0.  Thanks to Yaniv Ben
 	  Ari <yanivb@bis.co.il> for reporting this.

Wed Jan  9 11:38:58 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* tests/SSL/Makefile (LDLIBS):

	  Added missing SSL and crypto libraries.  Fixed link errors.
	  Thanks to Marvin Wolfthal <maw@weichi.com> for reporting the
	  error and suggesting a fix.

Wed Jan  9 12:24:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Process.cpp (spawn): Don't attempt ACE_OS::setpgid if
          ACE_LACKS_SETPGID is defined. Thanks to Victor Terber
          <vterber@csksoftware.de> for reporting this.

Wed Jan 09 11:19:07 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.h: Updated the comment for ACE_CE_Bridge to indicate that
	  it's obsolete and will be removed in the future.

Wed Jan 9 00:48:48 2002  Don Hinton <dhinton@gmx.net>

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:  Make sure to cast away constness
	  before deleting an ACE_TCHAR array.  Thanks to
	  Bala for reporting this.

Tue Jan  8 17:29:33 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp: Don't try to dereference a 0
          timeout pointer.  Gack.  Thanks to Ossama for pointing this out.

Tue Jan  8 15:51:06 2002  Don Hinton <dhinton@gmx.net>

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Moved the template instantiations from Service_Config.cpp to
          Get_Opt.cpp where they belong.

        * ace/Get_Opt.{h.cpp}: Replaced ACE_TString with ACE_TCHAR for
          type of member variable ACE_Get_Opt_Long_Option since it
          wasn't really needed and took up space.

Tue Jan  8 10:43:48 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/config-sunos5.5.h (ACE_LACKS_INET_ATON):

	  Solaris does indeed implement the inet_aton() function, but it
	  is found in `libresolv.*'.  It doesn't seem worth it to link
	  another library just for that function.  Just use the emulation
	  in ACE that has been used for years.

Tue Jan  8 11:31:22 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Makefile: When doing realclean, use the DLL_Test and
          Service_Config_DLL Makefiles to clean their files up.

Tue Jan  8 08:36:33 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect): Corrected order
          of operations checking EWOULDBLOCK, and fixed compile errors.
          Thanks to Vlado Chovanec <Vladimir.CHOVANEC@asset.sk> for this fix.

Mon Jan  7 19:55:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect): Added extra check
          for SSL_accept/connect status failure to avoid looping on a bad
          socket if the socket closes during handshake. Thanks to Vlado
          Chovanec <Vladimir.CHOVANEC@asset.sk> for this fix.

          Also added timeout countdown support for SSL_SOCK_Connector, same
          as in: Sun Jan  6 09:37:02 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

Mon Jan  7 15:55:26 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/INET_Addr.cpp (set):

	  Pass a pointer to a "struct in_addr" to inet_aton(), i.e. the
	  proper type, instead of a forcibly casted ACE_UINT32.  Also
	  updated existing code to use the in_addr::s_addr member instead
	  of the previous ACE_UINT32 variable.

Mon Jan  7 15:13:09 2002  Mayur Deshpande  <mayur@ics.uci.edu>

	* performance-tests/Misc/context_switch_time.cpp (main):
	  Since the Yield_test does seem to work on VxWorks now (see
	  ChangeLog below), the 'ifdefs' for bypassing VxWorks for the
	  Yield-Test have now been removed.

Mon Jan  7 15:08:25 2002  Mayur Deshpande  <mayur@ics.uci.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (thr_yield):
	  Changed ::taskDelay (1) to ::taskDelay (0) for VxWorks in
	  thr_yield ().  The change with (0), now does seem to perform
	  the yield correctly as reflected in the Yield-Test of
	  context_switch_time.  Thanks to Charlie Grames
	  <charlie.grames@windriver.com> for this tip.

Mon Jan  7 15:16:10 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/OS.h (INADDR_NONE):

	  If the platform does not define this constant, then define it.

	* ace/OS.cpp (inet_aton):

	  For some reason we were emulating inet_aton() on all platforms
	  using the now deprecated inet_addr() function.  Use the native
	  inet_aton() function unless ACE_LACKS_INET_ATON is defined.

	  Instead of performing a memcpy() of the IPv4 32-bit address into
	  the in_addr data structure, simply assign it to the s_addr field
	  of that data structure.  It's not clear why we didn't do this in
	  the first place.

	  (inet_ntoa):

	  Fixed PSoS emulation of this method.  The result is supposed to
	  be stored in a statically allocated string, not a dynamically
	  allocated one.  Fixes a memory leak.  Note that this change
	  makes the implementation non-reentrant.  However, inet_ntoa()
	  was not designed to be reentrant to begin with.

	* ace/OS.i (inet_addr):

	  On error, inet_addr() is supposed to return INADDR_NONE.

	  The return value should be a 32 bit unsigned integer, not a
	  signed one.

	* ace/config-win32-common.h:

	  MS Windows does not support the inet_aton() function.  Define
	  ACE_LACKS_INET_ATON.

Mon Jan  7 12:20:26 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

	  Added the MT_SSLIOP test to the regression test suite list.

Sun Jan  6 21:19:10 2002  John Aughey  <jha@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Uncommented out Conn_Test from daily builds.

Sun Jan  6 21:09:10 2002  John Aughey  <jha@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
	* ace/INET_Addr.h:

	  Reverted to January 1 version until I have time to put the
	  set_host_name() method in correctly.

Sun Jan  6 20:01:10 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/run_test.lst: Commented out Conn_Test from the daily
	  builds. This test seems to hang blocking build progress. Have
	  sent a mail to John Aughey on this.

Sun Jan  6 09:37:02 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (accept, ssl_accept):

	  Take into account the time to complete the basic TCP handshake
	  and the SSL handshake.  Specifically, ACE_Countdown_Time is used
	  to reduce the timeout value after each IO operation
	  (e.g. accept(), SSL_accept()) used during SSL passive connection
	  establishment.  [Bug 1110]

	  Commented out debugging statements.

Sat Jan  5 20:57:36 2002  Venkita Subramonian  <venkita@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Future.cpp (get): Added another ACE_const_cast in addition
	  to Doug's changes to fix compile errors. See below.

Sat Jan  5 14:57:36 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* ace/OS_QoS.h: Fix comments, put in doxygen format.

Sat Jan  5 08:59:41 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Future.cpp (get): Added an ACE_const_cast() to silence certain
	  C++ compilers.  Thanks to Venkita for reporting this.

Fri Jan  5 15:17:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.{h,cpp}:
          Added ACE_TSS_Emulation::release_key() method to release a
          thread_key within the TSS_Emulation when a thread is stopped.
          Added ACE_TSS_Emulation::tss_keys_used_ member to administrate which
          thread_keys are used and which not.
          Added ACE_TSS_Keys::is_set() method to test whether a specific
          thread_key is marked as used.
          Changed ACE_TSS_Emulation::next_key() method to return a thread_key
          that is not used yet, this key is then marked as used at the same
          time.
          Changed ACE_OS::thr_keyfree() method to release the key in the
          TSS_Emulation when ACE_HAS_TSS_EMULATION is defined.

          These changes fix the bugzilla bugs 223 and 657. The ACE_TSS_Emulation
          now recycles keys that are released earlier.

Fri Jan  4 19:59:03 2002  John Aughey  <jha@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp: Fixed the new set_host_name method

Fri Jan  4 18:59:27 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-01b: Added a new file. Trimmed this file
	  to have entries only in 2002.

Fri Jan  4 15:50:42 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):
          On ACE::select-reported timeout or failure, set status to return
          a -1 to caller, not 0. Thanks to Vladimir Chovanec
          <Vladimir.CHOVANEC@asset.sk> for reporting this and sending a fix.

Fri Jan  4 08:31:49 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Thread_Manager_Test.cpp (test_task_record_keeping): Fixed
	  a typo in an expression on line 226.  Thanks to Harvinder
 	  Sawhney <harvindersawhney@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Fri Jan  4 05:51:22 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Future.{h,cpp}: Made the get() and ready() methods const.
	  Thanks to Ran Kohavi <ran@kashya.con> for reporting this.

Fri Jan  4 15:06:31 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.h (operator=): Add <CHAR> to ACE_String_Base
          return type. Fixes compile error on IBM C/C++.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):
          If SSL_get_error() returns SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL and it's EWOULDBLOCK,
          don't blindly set both read and write handles for select. Check
          if SSL is indicating SSL_want_write() and set the proper handle.
          Also, don't ACE_ASSERT SSL_pending before return... if there's
          an SSL handshake screw-up (like someone trying to break in)
          just report the failure, don't abort/crash.

Wed Jan 02 13:27:09 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.h:
	* ace/INET_Addr.cpp: Removed tabs and trailing whitespaces.

Wed Jan  2 08:19:18 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/FILE_Connector.h,
	* ace/OS.h (ACE_OS): Clarified the weak semantics of O_APPEND
	  on Win32.  Thanks to Eugene Alterman <eugalt@myrealbox.com> for
 	  reporting this.

Wed Jan  2 12:43:00 2002  John Aughey  <jha@aughey.com>

	* ace/INET_Addr.h
	* ace/INET_Addr.cpp : Added set_host_name method and moved
	  relevant code into this method.  Changed signature of
	  set_address method to take a void pointer rather than a
	  char *.

Wed Jan  2 12:30:01 2002  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/RB_Tree.i
	* tests/RB_Tree_Test.cpp : added check for valid current node to
          forward_i and reverse_i methods of iterator base class.  Thanks to
          Craig L. Ching <cching@mqsoftware.com> for reporting this!

Wed Jan  2 08:19:18 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/README: Clarify that run_test.pl should be used rather
	  the run_tests.sh.

	* tests/run_tests.bat: Clarify that run_test.pl should be used
	  on Win9x.  Thanks to Edward A Thompson <ed4becky_2000@yahoo.com>
 	  for prompting this.

Wed Jan  2 07:37:01 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Handle_Set.h:
	* ace/Handle_Set.cpp: Added a method reset_state () to the
	  ACE_Handle_Set_Iterator class.

Tue Jan  2 11:39:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i:
          Added missing ACE_UNUSED_ARG in ACE_OS::event_timedwait

Tue Jan  1 15:36:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Added support
          for the buildbits=64 make option.

Tue Jan  1 20:05:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Name_Request_Reply.{h,cpp}:
          Changed type of 3 constructor arguments from size_t to ACE_UINT32
          because the members in which these arguments are stored are also
          of type ACE_UINT32

        * ace/OS.i
          In ACE_OS::umask method, changed the type in the ACE_OSCALL_RETURN
          macro from int to mode_t because that is the return type of the
          method

Tue Jan  1 08:47:25 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@siesta.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Thread.h: Clarify how the ACE_Thread_Adapter is deleted
	  when spawn() is called.  Thanks to Preston Elder
 	  <prez@srealm.net.au> for reporting this confusion.

Tue Jan  1 14:09:26 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Map_Manager/test_hash_map_manager.cpp:
          Made this example compiling when ACE_USES_WCHAR is set

        * Makefile.bor:
          Added examples directory because all examples for which there are
          BCB makefiles now build when ACE_USES_WCHAR is set

Tue Jan  1 00:02:12 2002  Nanbor Wang <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.vcp: Added String_Base_Const.*.
