Tue Aug 24 10:22:18 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* ace/config-linux-common.h: Added ACE_HAS_SCANDIR and a new
	  macro, ACE_SCANDIR_CMP_USES_VOIDPTR, saying that scandir()
	  cmp() function takes void pointers, not dirent pointers.

	* ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl (scandir): When calling native scandir()
	  with ACE_SCANDIR_CMP_USES_VOIDPTR, cast comparator appropriately.
	  Also, for native scandir(), ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR the dirname.

	* ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl:
	* tests/Test_Output.cpp: Added #include "ace/OS_NS_string.h" to get
	  ACE_OS string methods. Fixes compile error on inline=0 build.

Tue Aug 24 11:16:00 2004  Jules White   <jules@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
        
        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Added a section on using ACE within Eclipse

Tue Aug 24 10:10:22 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

	* ace/config-all.h: Moved #include "ace/OS_main.h" down to the bottom
	  of the file, lest it invoke a circular dependency.

	* ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl: Added #include "ace/config-all.h" to get
	  ACE_TRACE.

Mon Aug 23 23:23:18 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS):

	  Removed required Automake version from `Makefile.am'.
	  `configure.ac' already defines it.

	* configure.ac:

	  Updated required version of Automake to 1.9.

	  Added test for partial template specialization.  Issue a warning
	  if it isn't support by the compiler since ACE will require it in
	  the near future.

	* ace/ACE.h:

	  Corrected ACE namespace documentation to describe the ACE
	  namespace itself rather than summarizing the contents of this
	  header (i.e. the value added global ACE functions).

	* ace/If_Then_Else.h:

	  Doxygen documentation corrections and improvements.

Mon Aug 23 22:19:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* tests/CDR_Test.cpp (run_main):

	  Added run-time assertions that verify proper CDR type sizes
	  (e.g. sizeof (ACE_CDR::Boolean) == 1).

Mon Aug 23 19:18:58 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* m4/config_h.m4:

	  Removed autoheader template for ACE_LACKS_PARAM_H.

Mon Aug 23 18:33:40 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* configure.ac:

	  Added check for ACE_HAS_ITOA.
	  Added check for ACE_LACKS_ITOW.

          ACE_HAS_SYS_SOCKIO_H.

Mon Aug 23 17:41:40 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* m4/config_h.m4:
	* m4/platform.m4:

	  Removed support for unused ACE_NETBSD feature test macro.

Mon Aug 23 17:37:16 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* m4/platform.m4:

	  Add check for ACE_LACKS_PERFECT_MULTICAST_FILTERING.

Mon Aug 23 16:33:59 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* ace/config-netbsd.h:

	  Remove PACKAGE, PACKAGE_*, and VERSION definitions.  The latter
	  conflicts with some of the test/example programs.  I'll get rid
	  of the others just to be safe.

	  Comment out ACE_NTRACE, as the constant definition conflicts
	  with Misc_test_trace.  We probably need an option to control
	  whether tracing and debugging features are enabled when ACE/
	  TAO is compiled that is separate from the one used after it
	  has been built.

Mon Aug 23 16:06:39 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* configure.ac:

	  Added checks for ACE_HAS_VWFPRINTF and ACE_HAS_VWSPRINTF.

Tue Aug 24 00:34:30 2004  Marek Brudka  <mbrudka@elka.pw.edu.pl>

	* ace/QtReactor.cpp:
	Removed unecessary #include <qeventloop.h>. Thanks to
	Gan Deng <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu> for a patch.


Mon Aug 23 17:53:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Added support for itanium on HPUX 11iv2 (11.23). Different options
          have to be passed when on itanium, so when version 11.23 is detected,
          set itanium to 1 and dependent on that set different compiler options.

Mon Aug 23 16:58:18 UTC 2004  Don Hinton  <don.hinton@vanderbilt.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Added CCFLAGS to the list of arguments passed to the dependency
          generator.  Thanks to Matthew Townsend <mtownsen@harris.com>
          for reporting the problem.

        * THANKS:
          Added Matthew Townsend to the hall of fame.

Mon Aug 23 08:34:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux11.h:
          Removed this file from the repo, use config-hpux-11.00.h instead,
          the contents of this file refers to config-hpux11-xx.h files
          which are not there, making this file unusable.

Sun Aug 22 21:49:14 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* ace/config-netbsd.h:

	  Update with autoconf generated results.  While not perfect, the
	  old version would be difficult to update by hand.

Mon Aug 23 01:04:34 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:

	  Made some slight changes to the BUG 1890 patch after receiving
	  some clarifications from Kobi.

Sun Aug 22 11:11:00 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/amh.mpb:
          When using amh, you must have valuetype support, so add valuetype
          as base project of amh

Sun Aug 22 09:53:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:

          Changed to remove compile warning resulting from bad use
          of ACE_UNUSED_ARG().

Fri Aug 20 15:29:29 MST 2004  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

         * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
         * tests/run_test.pl:
           Changed the run test scripts to time the execution
           and print test finished messages.  This for the
           generation of statistics.

Fri Aug 20 15:10:08 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core.mpb:

	  Changed to define INSTALL_THIS_TARGET for automake builds.

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taodefaults.mpb:

	  Changed to add $(TAO_BUILDDIR) to includes for automake builds.

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

	  Changed to add $(ACE_BUILDDIR) to includes for automake builds.

Fri Aug 20 12:17:39 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* m4/config_h.m4:

	  Added check for ACE_SIZEOF_WCHAR.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Revert.  It triggers (or causes) an intermittent problem
          in the Timer_Cancellation_Test

Fri Aug 20 10:22:34 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * TAO/tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:
          Revert this.  It wasn't supposed to be included in my previous
          check in. (Thu Aug 19 12:42:19 2004)

Fri Aug 20 15:20:31 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        Fixes for Bug 1890. Please see

        http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1890

        for details of this bug. What follows are the individual changes.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:

          Added a new method clear_dispatch_mask (), which as the name
          indicates clears the masks in the dispatch_set. The dispatch set
          is a new addition, which keeps track of the handles that can be
          used for dispatching.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.inl:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.h: Modified dispatch_io_set () so that it
          doesn't break the loop when state_changes occur. This is the
          crux of the 1890 bug report. If unbinding occurs as part of an
          upcall, the bit_ops () calls clear_dispatch_mask (), which
          prevents dispatching to already removed (and potentially
          rebounded) handles.

          Additional cosmetic changes.

        * ace/Priority_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Priority_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.inl:

          Replicate changes to the above reactors.

        * ace/Signal.h:
        * ace/Signal.inl:

          Added a default argument to the ACE_Signal class, which is used
          by the ACE_Select_Reactor.

	  Thanks to Kobi for the patches.

Fri Aug 20 14:26:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Process_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Changed to use a separate logfile per child (based on PID like
          in MEM_Stream_Test) because of concurrency problems in using a
          single non-synchronized child logfile (at least under windows).

Fri Aug 20 14:10:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:

          Changed to use child processes instead of threads for testing.
          See also [Bug 1793].

Fri Aug 20 07:47:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added $(EXEEXT) to BIN build target.
          Removed from $(EXEEXT) from install and cleanup target
          because these are derived from build target.
          This improves link behaviour (disables unnecessary links
          because dependency checks on build targets did not function)
          on platforms using GNU make and having a executable extension
          (like MingW; .exe).
          Fixes [Bug 1876].

        * apps/gperf/tests/tests.mpc:

          Added $(EXEEXT) to verbatim 'runtests' targets because
          otherwise dependencies on build targets do not function
          anymore.

Thu Aug 19 16:45:05 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/security.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from orbsvcslib.

Thu Aug 19 12:42:19 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * TAO/tests/MT_Client/client.cpp:

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
        Repeat part of the checkin from Fri Aug 13 15:26:40 2004
        This corrects the incorrect thread-in-use count problem
        that leads to premature TSS key deletion, but does not fix
        the TSS leak because fixing that reveals other problems
        that I don't have a solution for, yet.

Thu Aug 19 08:26:11 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * apps/drwho/Rwho_DB_Manager.h:

          Changed to #include <sys/types.h> before <protocols/rwhod.h>,
          as the latter needs the former on some systems.

Thu Aug 19 08:07:53 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * examples/APG/Signals/SigAction.cpp:

          Changed to use a (conditional) extern "C" linkage block around
          my_sighandler, because the plain extern "C" directive resulted
          in a declaration with multiple storage classes.

Thu Aug 19 08:44:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:
          Ask for the default.features file used by MPC.

Wed Aug 18 21:02:34 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Revert TSS leak fix (temporarily, I hope)
          until I can find and eliminate the hang.

Wed Aug 18 15:07:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:
          bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

        Fixed wrong comment characters.

Wed Aug 18 13:35:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:

        Added support for building VC8 projects.

Wed Aug 18 13:29:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

        Added support for building VC8 projects.

Wed Aug 18 08:50:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        * ace/Asynch_Connector.h:
        * ace/Asynch_Connector.cpp:

          Thanks to Douglas for his assistance. This change introduces a
          class-static "local_default" for use as the default parameter
          for the second attribute of
          ACE_Asynch_Connector<>::connect(). This "simplifies" the nested
          templated class for the Solaris Lynxos GCC295 cross compiler
          which was faulting due to the complexity of this
          definition. This change does not appreachiably modify the
          signature of the member function, just stops clients from having
          to create their own local default parameter.

Wed Aug 18 01:05:37 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_netbsd.GNU:

          Update to support current NetBSD platforms.

Tue Aug 17 21:03:08 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/interceptors.mpb:

          New file, with base project requiring interceptors.  Project
          files should inherit from this instead of providing explicit
          requires statements to eliminate duplicate entries in list.

Tue Aug 17 17:42:16 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/rtcosscheduler.mpb:

          Changed to inherit from orbsvcslib.

Tue Aug 17 09:50:46 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

 	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_servant_dnc.mpb:

          Added the path to $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs to the CIDL compiler.

Tue Aug 17 14:30:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp
          Revertion of change to this file (for the sake of being complete).

Tue Aug 17 13:00:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>
        * ace/Asynch_Connector.h
          Revertion of change to this file as it breaks the windows build and
          changed the public interface of the template class.

Tue Aug 17 10:03:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG() to is_sock_error() for non-WIN32
          builds.

Tue Aug 17 09:43:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:

          Removed DOS style linefeeds.

Tue Aug 17 08:49:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_String.cpp:

          Removed some hidden characters causing compile problems.

Tue Aug 17 08:00:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>
        * ace/Asynch_Connector.h
        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp
          Due to a long standing fatal cross development compiler bug in the
          Solaris -> Lynxos cross development environment.
          (LynxOS gcc 2.95.3 cross compiler)

Tue Aug 17 08:00:00 UTC 2004  Martin Corino <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ACE.h:
          ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added ACE::is_sock_error() to be able to test if errorcode is
          WinSock error *before* converting to error string.

        * ace/OS_NS_String.cpp:

          Fixed WCHAR bug in ACE_OS::strerror().
          Introduced use of ACE::is_sock_error().

Mon Aug 16 22:53:53 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (~ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream):

          Removed useless invalidation of "ssl_" pointer member by
          assignment of zero.  Once the destructor is called, the object
          no longer exists so invalidation is unnecessary.

Mon Aug 16 16:54:18 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ftorbutils.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/smart_proxies.mpb
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/svc_utils.mpb

          Changed to inherit from orbsvcslib instead of taolib_with_idl.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:

          Added $(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs to includes.
          Added -I$(TAO_ROOT)/orbsvcs to idlflags.

Mon Aug 16 15:58:21 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Signal.cpp: Added template instantiations for
          ACE_Fixed_Set_Iterator_Base. Related to:
          Mon Aug  2 08:55:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

Mon Aug 16 15:30:29 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Task.cpp (svc_run): Added "defined (ACE_WIN32)" to the
          "defined (__IBMCPP__)" test for how to cast a thread result.
          __IBMCPP__ is defined for both Windows (where the alternate cast
          is needed) and AIX (where it is prohibited).
          This is related to this change:
          Fri Aug  6 08:34:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemen@remedy.nl>

Mon Aug 16 11:54:50 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h (debug):

          Corrected the export qualifier for these functions.  They are no
          longer inlined.

Mon Aug 16 11:16:02 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h:

          Moved remaining ACE namespace variables out of header and into
          the '.cpp' file.  They should not be accessed/modified
          directly.

        * ace/ACE.inl (hex_chars_, nibble2hex):

          No need to declare/define the hex_chars_ constant variable in
          the ACE namespace.  Define it as a static constant in the
          nibble2hex() function instead, the only place it is used.

        * ace/ACE.cpp (debug):

          Unlined these functions.  They generally aren't performance
          critical, and doing so allows us to remove the ACE::debug_
          internal variable to the '.cpp' file.

Mon Aug 16 11:16:02 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h:
        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added remaining missing DLL export qualifiers.  Fixes
          "unresolved external symbol" errors in MS Windows builds.

          Moved variables in ACE namespace that are internal to ACE into
          the '.cpp' file.  They should be not be accessed or modified
          directly.

Mon Aug 16 10:58:09 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ACE.h (recv):

          Fixed DLL export qualifier.  Addresses "unresolved external
          symbol" link-time errors in MS Windows builds.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_stub.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_deployment_svnt.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ciao_server_dnc.mpb:

          Changed the names of the Deployment libraries. Arranged the
          dependencies in such a manner so that it is easier to use it in
          the application.

Mon Aug 16 09:27:12 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:

           Added MSVC 7.1 compatibility through '-vc7' option.

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:

          Added MSVC 7.1 compatibility through '-vc7' option. Added
          support for MPC '-name_modifier' option.

        * bin/msvc_static_compile.lst:

          Removed projectfile extensions to be able to generate these
          dynamically from 'msvc_static_compile.pl'.

Sat Aug 14 19:38:20 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          Do not include "ace/If_Then_Else.h" when using MSVC++ 6.  It
          can't handle the partial template specializations in that file.

Sat Aug 14 19:34:02 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp (ipv6_enabled_):

          Fixed syntax error.

Sat Aug 14 13:07:50 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/QoS/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.cpp (subscribe_ifs):

          The "ACE_Sock_Connect" interim pseudo namespace no longer
          exists.  Use the true "ACE" C++ namespace instead.  Fixes a
          compile-time error.

Sat Aug 14 14:48:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Add /usr/lib as a path for library check. If the location of the
          library is not specified by the application, the compiler,
          linker and loader knows where to look in for *nix based
          systems. So should our library checker.Without this applications
          MPC file starts pointing to /usr/lib to locate libraries like
          PCAP and XERCES, which can be installed with system
          libraries. It is bad to see installation specific thingies
          making its way up the order.

Sat Aug 14 09:28:19 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          MSVC++ 6 can't handle partial template specializations so fall
          back on an unsigned char typedef if _MSC_VER < 1300 (i.e. MSVC++
          version is less than 7).  This is an interim solution to get the
          MSVC++ 6 builds going again.

        * ace/IfThenElse.h:
        * ace/If_Then_Else.h:

          Renamed the former to the latter, including the class template
          defined within, to match ACE naming conventions.  Thanks to Doug
          for pointing this out.

Sat Aug 14 01:43:16 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR):

          Parenthesize boolean condition that is the first argument to the
          ACE::IfThenElse<> template to avoid any potential confusion.

Sat Aug 14 00:33:59 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/IfThenElse.h (IfThenElse):

          Place sample code within a Doxygen code block.  Addresses some
          documentation formatting problems.

Fri Aug 13 23:26:56 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/IfThenElse.h:

          New template that allows one to choose between two types at
          compile-time based on a boolean value.  This is basically the
          IfThenElse template described in the book "C++ Templates" by
          Vandevoorde and Josuttis.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR::Boolean):

          Detect at compile-time whether the C++ "bool" type can be used
          as the underlying ACE_CDR::Boolean type using the new
          ACE::IfThenElse template.

          Functions that were in the pseudo "ACE" namespace are now in a
          true "ACE" C++ namespace.

        * ace/ACE.inl (log2):

          Use the prefix increment operator when incrementing the loop
          index.  It is generally more efficient than the postfix
          increment operator.

          Updated all calls to functions that were in the pseudo "ACE"
          namespace through a former ACE class base class
          (e.g. ACE_Sock_Connect, ACE_Flag_Manip, etc) to use the correct
          "ACE" namespace.  Use of the base class names should never have
          been used since it was known long ago that the "ACE" pseudo
          namespace would be changed to true C++ namespace.

Sat Aug 14 01:58:32 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Release:

          Added the NEWS file to the release. Thanks to Ramiro Morales
          <rm0 at gmx dot net> for reporting the problem.

          Updated the documentation so it's more clear.  Thanks to Andrew
 	  Athan <aathan-ace-bugs-1524@cloakmail.com> for motivating this.

        * ace/Stream.h: Updated the documentation for push() and pop() to
          clarify how it affects open() and close() hooks on the tasks.
  	  Thanks to Andrew Athan <aathan-ace-bugs-1524@cloakmail.com> for
 	  motivating this.

Fri Aug 13 15:26:40 2004  Dale Wilson  <wilson_d@ociweb.com>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Pass the TSS key to ACE_OS::thr_key_detach.  This
          eliminates the table lookup formerly required to
          identify the key being detached.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
          --Accept and use the TSS key from TST_T.cpp
          --Typedef the function pointer used to delete TSS
          objects.  This improves readability.
          --Change the name of the ACE_TSS_Info member from
          tss_obj_ to tss_info_.  This avoids confusion
          due to conflicting use of the name "tss_obj"
          --Check to see if a thread has actually used
          a TSS key before decrementing the "number of
          threads using this key" counter.  This eliminates
          a messy situation in which the key is deleted
          while threads are still using it.
          --Fix bugzilla 1542:  Leaks in ACE_TSS
          Note that the patch suggested
          in the bugzilla report did not completely address
          the problem, so this fix takes a different approach.
          Significant features of this change:
          > The ACE_TSS_Cleanup::detach method now frees the
            thread's specified TSS entry.  Formerly it leaked it.
          > The exit method defers to the detach method to
            free the entry. This ensures entries are handled
            consistently -- no matter how they are freed up.
          > The ACE_TSS_Cleanup::in_use_ entry receives special
            handling to avoid using it while deleting it.  Formerly
            it was leaked, so it didn't matter.
          -- Note this does NOT address bugzilla 1797.  I'll
          look at that one next.

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
          Eliminating TSS leaks revealed another problem.  The
          main thread was not waiting for other threads to exit
          before dismantling the ACE infrastructure in
          Object_Manager::fini.  There's a hack in Thread_Manager
          that disables the wait method when the Object_Manager
          is shutting down.
          Unfortunatly this causes a messy race condition in which
          one thread is deleting objects while other threads are
          using them.
          The "solution" here is to call Thread_Manager::wait()
          with a short (1 second) timeout.  If the threads have
          already exited -- no problem, and no delay.  If they
          haven't, they get a chance to exit cleanly.

Fri Aug 13 18:43:01 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h (ACE_CDR):

          Reverted the usage of C++ bool as a typedef of
          ACE_CDR::Boolean. We will now use unsigned char on all
          platforms. MacOSX (Panther) atleast makes the size of bool to be
          4 bytes which creates problems for TAO. Thanks to Rich Shapiro
          <rshapiro at bbn dot com> for reporting the problem.

Fri Aug 13 18:44:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/IOStream_T.h:
          When ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_FX is defined, also include ace/os_include/
          os_ctype.h

Fri Aug 13 12:03:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Also install pidl files

Fri Aug 13 07:15:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Pass the def file with -Wl, to the compiler, it is a linker option
          and with the Cygwin GCC 3.3.3 it seems the compiler thinks the def
          file is a modula2 file. By marking it as linker option it works
          without problems again

        * etc/*.doxygen:
          Set INTERNAL_DOCS to YES, that way we generate documentation for
          stuff marked with @internal, but doxygen will make sure the
          documentation says it is for internal use only

Thu Aug 12 21:17:05 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/taolib.mpb:

Thu Aug 12 07:54:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Removed support for buildbits=64 again, the way I tried it doesn't
          work

Wed Aug 11 22:20:49 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Priority of OS.h and Synch.h inclusions have been reduced.

          with the modules in MPC.

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Put back the getBasePath() function and cleaned up the VMS

Wed Aug 11 10:32:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Don't run the PluggableUDP examples when NO_DIOP is defined,
          makes it possible to exclude these examples in builds that don't
          have DIOP

Wed Aug 11 08:32:12 UTC 2004  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Process.cpp:

        * include/makeinclude/platform-openvms.GNU:
          Removed mathlibrary from required libs.
          Added dummy code to circumvent 'touch' problem with OpenVMS make port.

Wed Aug 11 08:00:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Tue Aug 10 10:57:00 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          disabled.

Tue Aug 10 11:08:31 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: Removed ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER and
          ACE_LACKS_TOWUPPER. These functions are present but, I suspect,
          marked "lacks" because of type conflicts, which J.T. Conklin fixed:

Tue Aug 10 06:52:47 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Removed AC_LANG_PUSH([C])/.../AC_LANG_POP([C]) which forced the
          use of C for selected AC_CHECK_FUNC calls.  The current version
          of autoconf always uses C.

Tue Aug 10 14:00:00 UTC 2004  Simon Massey  <simon.massey@prismtechnologies.com>

        I shouldn't have been rushed into these guarded #includes. The

        after the rest.

        * ace/FILE_IO.h
        * ace/FIFO_Send_Msg.h
          Moved guarded  #include "ace/OS_NS_stropts.h"  to end of other

          Added guard checks around #include "ace/OS_NS_fcntl.h"

        * ace/DEV_IO.h
        * ace/FILE_IO.h

Mon Aug  9 23:13:48 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
          Remove #define of ACE_LACKS_TOWLOWER and ACE_LACKS_TOWUPPER.
          FreeBSD has these functions, but they were disabled because
          of the problem below.

        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.h:

          ACE_OS::ace_toupper() and ACE_OS::ace_towupper() because they
          are ambiguous on systems where wint_t is in fact an int.  The
          same was done for ACE_OS::to_lower(), etc.

Mon Aug  9 18:12:12 UTC 2004  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp (realpath):

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: If the version of glibc
          is less than 2.1 add the ACE_HAS_NONCONST_MSGSND macro.  Thanks

        From Jaroslaw Nozderko <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl>.
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (register_handler_i):

          Allow same handler to be registered with a different event,
          which is consistent with the other reactor implementations.

        * ace/Svc_Handler.h:
        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp:
          Add throw() exception specifier to no-throw version of class
          local operator new.  In addition to squelching warnings from
          gcc, this tells the compiler to check the return value before
          constructing the object.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added macros in a specific section for the bmake project type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Updated Borland templates to handle resource files in
          subdirectories, this is needed for the moving of the mpc
          files in TAO. Thanks to J.T. Conklin for making these
          patches.

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp (ACE_Fixed_Set_Iterator::remove()): Had to
          qualify 'iterated_items_' with 'this->' to make it visible in this
          class now that iterated_items_ is in an inherited class. This per
          HP-UX aC++, citing [temp.dep], 14.6.2(3) in the C++ Standard.

Mon Aug  2 15:20:37 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Added #include
          "ace/os_include/os_stddef.h" to pick up size_t for platforms where
          it's not defined by the compiler, such as Cygwin. Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Mon Aug  2 08:55:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.h: The class ACE_Fixed_Set had some bugs in
          it's interface declaration and also some in it's implementation:
          1) typedef the wrong class for is constant iterator and
          2) its method size() misbehave in certain circumstances where
             elements were randomly deleted from a set object.
          Moreover, the iterators of ACE_Fixed_Set has a lot of code in
          common so the can be refactored to have a common abstract
          ancestor with all the shared code.  Therefore, refactored the
          three classes and fixed the bug on the size() method.  Thanks
          to J. Abelardo Gutierrez <jabelardo@cantv.net> for these fixes.

Mon Aug  2 09:06:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h: Removed the #include os_time.h - it's
          not needed for anything in this header, and for some reason, it
          introduces a type oddity on HP-UX - aC++ gets the idea there's a
          tentative struct sigaction and doesn't match the real one, causing
          compile errors in ACE_OS::sigaction().

        * ace/OS_TLI.h: Removed stray '#'.

        * ace/Signal.{h inl}: Removed the hack typedef ACE_SIGACTION that
          was allegedly put in for an HP-UX C++ bug. It's not needed and is
          causing further problems. #include "ace/os_include/os_signal.h"
          to get the needed signal-related types.

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Changed #include "ace/OS.h" to
          "ace/OS_NS_errno.h". Removing the "big hammer" OS.h stuff. This
          fixes a compile error in OS_TLI.inl on HP-UX w/ aC++. Why? I
          have no idea... there's something odd still about orders of
          includes and/or preprocessor defs or something. This odd compile
          error creeps up every once in a while and is always related to
          fudging something somewhere (see fix above for signal...) but
          this one doesn't have an apparant cause.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Removed AREXTRA. It
          was breaking static lib builds.

Sun Aug  1 08:15:23 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Moved subdirectory configuration above call to AC_OUTPUT.

        * ace/OS_Memory.h:
          Provide ACE_nothrow and ACE_nothrow_t definitions for platforms
          where definitions are not handled by special cases.

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added check for ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW.

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Removed commented out lines

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
          Changed to signature for the to_string methods from char to
          ACE_CDR::char so that they match the implementation

Sun Aug  1 09:07:16 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-04a:

          Moved contents from this file to a new file.

        * bin/generate_rel_manpages:

          This is now executed at tao.dre for generating doxygen
          documentation. The files are then scp'ed to the main website.

Sat Jul 31 11:13:20 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE version 5.4.2 released.
