	* ace/config-linux-common.h: If the version of glibc
	  is less than 2.1 add the ACE_HAS_NONCONST_MSGSND macro.  Thanks
 	  to Anand <anand@icmgworld.com> and Johnny Willemsen for this
 	  fix.

	From Jaroslaw Nozderko <jaroslaw.nozderko@polkomtel.com.pl>.
	* ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (register_handler_i):

	  Allow same handler to be registered with a different event,
	  which is consistent with the other reactor implementations.

	* ace/Svc_Handler.h:
	* ace/Svc_Handler.cpp:
	  Add throw() exception specifier to no-throw version of class
	  local operator new.  In addition to squelching warnings from
	  gcc, this tells the compiler to check the return value before
	  constructing the object.

          Updated location of TAO vc6 static project files

Tue Aug  3 06:19:06 2004  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb:

          Added macros in a specific section for the bmake project type.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/BorlandProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
          Updated Borland templates to handle resource files in
          subdirectories, this is needed for the moving of the mpc
          files in TAO. Thanks to J.T. Conklin for making these
          patches.

Mon Aug  2 15:33:27 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Containers_T.cpp (ACE_Fixed_Set_Iterator::remove()): Had to
          qualify 'iterated_items_' with 'this->' to make it visible in this
          class now that iterated_items_ is in an inherited class. This per
          HP-UX aC++, citing [temp.dep], 14.6.2(3) in the C++ Standard.

Mon Aug  2 15:20:37 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Added #include
          "ace/os_include/os_stddef.h" to pick up size_t for platforms where
          it's not defined by the compiler, such as Cygwin. Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Mon Aug  2 08:55:17 2004  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T.h: The class ACE_Fixed_Set had some bugs in
          it's interface declaration and also some in it's implementation:
          1) typedef the wrong class for is constant iterator and
          2) its method size() misbehave in certain circumstances where
             elements were randomly deleted from a set object.
          Moreover, the iterators of ACE_Fixed_Set has a lot of code in
          common so the can be refactored to have a common abstract
          ancestor with all the shared code.  Therefore, refactored the
          three classes and fixed the bug on the size() method.  Thanks
          to J. Abelardo Gutierrez <jabelardo@cantv.net> for these fixes.

Mon Aug  2 09:06:39 2004  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/os_include/os_signal.h: Removed the #include os_time.h - it's
          not needed for anything in this header, and for some reason, it
          introduces a type oddity on HP-UX - aC++ gets the idea there's a
          tentative struct sigaction and doesn't match the real one, causing
          compile errors in ACE_OS::sigaction().

        * ace/OS_TLI.h: Removed stray '#'.

        * ace/Signal.{h inl}: Removed the hack typedef ACE_SIGACTION that
          was allegedly put in for an HP-UX C++ bug. It's not needed and is
          causing further problems. #include "ace/os_include/os_signal.h"
          to get the needed signal-related types.

        * apps/JAWS3/jaws3/Event_Result.h: Changed #include "ace/OS.h" to
          "ace/OS_NS_errno.h". Removing the "big hammer" OS.h stuff. This
          fixes a compile error in OS_TLI.inl on HP-UX w/ aC++. Why? I
          have no idea... there's something odd still about orders of
          includes and/or preprocessor defs or something. This odd compile
          error creeps up every once in a while and is always related to
          fudging something somewhere (see fix above for signal...) but
          this one doesn't have an apparant cause.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: Removed AREXTRA. It
          was breaking static lib builds.

Sun Aug  1 08:15:23 2004  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:
          Moved subdirectory configuration above call to AC_OUTPUT.

        * ace/OS_Memory.h:
          Provide ACE_nothrow and ACE_nothrow_t definitions for platforms
          where definitions are not handled by special cases.

        * configure.ac:
        * m4/config_h.m4:
          Added check for ACE_HAS_NEW_NOTHROW.

        * ace/QoS/qos.mpc:
          Also with bmake set macros += ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2_GQOS

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
          Doxygen improvements/fixes

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
          Removed commented out lines

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
          Changed to signature for the to_string methods from char to
          ACE_CDR::char so that they match the implementation

Sun Aug  1 09:07:16 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-04a:

          Moved contents from this file to a new file.

Sat Jul 31 17:01:27 2004  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_rel_manpages:

          This is now executed at tao.dre for generating doxygen
          documentation. The files are then scp'ed to the main website.

Sat Jul 31 11:13:20 2004  Ossama Othman  <ossama@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE version 5.4.2 released.
