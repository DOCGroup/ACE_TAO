	* ace/CDR_Stream.cpp: Changed the copy constructor for the
	  ACE_InputCDR's. Instead of duplicating the ACE_Data_Block we
	  now use the new copy constructor in the ACE_Message_Block.

	* ace/Message_Block.h:
	* ace/Message_Block.cpp: Added a new copy constructor to the
	  ACE_Message_Block. This copy constructor does a deep copy from
	  the data block if the data block of the incoming message block
	  is on the stack or does a shallow copy of the data block (by
	  incrementing the ref count) if it is on the heap.
