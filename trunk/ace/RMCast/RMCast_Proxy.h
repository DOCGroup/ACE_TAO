//! Local representation for remote peers
/*!
  Both senders and receivers in the multicast group need to maintain
  explicit representations of their "peers".  For example, a sender
  needs to know the list of all the receivers and what messages they
  have reported as successfully received.
  Likewise, the receiver needs to maintain separate state for each
  remote sender, and must be able to disconnect from all of them
  gracefully when needed.
  The RMCast_Proxy class is an opaque representation of such a peer,
  and hides all the networking details from the rest of the system.
