{
  // = TITLE
  //   Defines a factory that creates new <ACE_Stream>s actively.
  //
  // = DESCRIPTION
  //   The <ACE_SOCK_Connector> doesn't have a socket of its own,
  //   i.e., it simply "borrows" the one from the ACE_SOCK_Stream
  //   that's being connected.  The reason for this is that the
  //   underlying socket API doesn't use a "factory" socket to connect
  //   "data-mode" sockets.  Therefore, there's no need to inherit
  //   <ACE_SOCK_Connector> from <ACE_SOCK>.  A nice side-effect of
  //   this is that <ACE_SOCK_Connector>'s do not store state so they
  //   can be used reentrantly in multi-threaded programs.
public:
  // = Initialization and termination methods.

  // Default constructor.
