 * Configurator-based application.
 *
 * This class contains a vector of <ACE_Service_Types> *'s and
 * allows an administrative entity to centrally manage and
 * control the behavior of application services.  Note that if
 * services are removed from the middle of the repository the
 * order won't necessarily be maintained since the <remove>
 * method performs compaction.  However, the common case is not
 * to remove services, so typically they are deleted in the
 * reverse order that they were added originally.
