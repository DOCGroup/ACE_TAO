  // = TITLE
  //    Manages a group of processes.
  //
  // = DESCRIPTION
  //    This class allows applications to control groups of processes,
  //    similar to how the <ACE_Thread_Manager> controls groups of
  //    threads.  Naturally, it doesn't work at all on platforms, such
  //    as VxWorks or pSoS, that don't support process.
  //
  //    There are two (main) ways of using <ACE_Process_Manager>,
  //    depending on how involved you wish to be with the termination
  //    of managed <ACE_Process>es.  If you just want <Process>es to
  //    go away when they're finished, simply register the
  //    <Process_Manager> with an <ACE_Reactor>:
  //
  //        ACE_Process_Manager mgr( 100, some_reactor )
  //         -or-
  //        ACE_Process_Manager mgr;
  //        ...
  //        mgr.open( 100, some_reactor );
  //
  //    Then, the <Process_Manager> will clean up after any
  //    <Process>es that it spawns.  (On Unix, this means executing a
  //    wait(2) to collect the exit status -- and avoid zombie
  //    processes; on Win32, it means closing the process and thread
  //    HANDLEs that are created when CreateProcess is called.)
  //
  //    If, on the other hand (and for some inexplicable reason) you
  //    want to explicitly invoke the terminated <Process> cleanup
  //    code, then *don't* register the <Process_Manager> with a
  //    Reactor, and be sure to call one of the
  //    <Process_Manager::wait> functions whenever there might be
  //    managed <Process>es that have exited.
  //
  //    Note that in either case, <Process_Manager> allows you to
  //    register "<Event_Handlers>" to be called when a specific
  //    <Process> exits, or when any <Process> without a specific
  //    <Event_Handler> exits.  When a <Process> exits, the
  //    appropriate <Event_Handler>'s <handle_input> is called; the
  //    <ACE_HANDLE> passed is either the Process' HANDLE (on Win32),
  //    or its pid cast to an <ACE_HANDLE> (on unix).
  //
  //    It is also possible to call the <Process_Manager::wait>
  //    functions even though the <Process_Manager> is registered with
  //    a <Reactor>.  I don't know what happens in this case, but it's
  //    probably not *too* bad.
  //
  //    Note also that the wait functions are "sloppy" on Unix,
  //    because there's no good way to wait for a subset of the
  //    children of a process.  The wait functions may end up
  //    collecting the exit status of a process that's not managed by
  //    the <Process_Manager> whose <wait> you invoked.  It's best to
  //    only use a single <Process_Manager>, and to create all
  //    subprocesses by calling that <Process_Manager>'s <spawn>
  //    method.  (I have some ideas for workarounds to improve this
  //    situation, but I consider it fairly low priority because I
  //    think the "single <Process_Manager>" pattern will be
  //    sufficient in most cases.)
  //
  //    Incidentally, here's how the auto-reaping works on unix when
  //    you register your <Process_Manager> with a <Reactor>:
  //
  //    * the <Process_Manager> opens ACE_DEV_NULL to get a dummy
  //      <HANDLE>.
  //
  //    * the dummy <HANDLE> is registered with the <Reactor>, but
  //      with a NULL_MASK so that it's never normally active.
  //
  //    * the <Process_Manager> also registers a signal handler for
  //      SIGCHLD.
  //
  //    * the SIGCHLD handler, when invoked, marks the dummy <HANDLE>
  //      as ready for input.
  //
  //    * the <Reactor> calls the <Process_Manager>'s <handle_input>
  //      (this happens synchronously, not in sighandler-space).
  //
  //    * <handle_input> collects all available exit statuses.
