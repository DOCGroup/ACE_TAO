<h2>Issues with Real-Time CORBA 1.0 Specification</h2>

This material will be available shortly.
<!--
<p>the spec (to be Submitted to the OMG)<br>
- Evaluation of policies<br>
- Model (structure) In Pool with Lanes, threads never change their<br>
priorities for the duration of request (what's the point then of<br>
carefully presetting the resources?). In Pools without lanes,<br>
priorities of threads can be adjusted for the duration of the call.<br>
- All policy configuraitons (valid/invalid/use cases) </p>

<p>- POA - accessing effective policies for the object on the server side.<br>
- Policies like client protocol that can be set on both client and<br>
- server (orb defaults)<br>
- which policy exception to throw if attempting to set a policy that's<br>
only valid on POA level at object level. </p>

<p>- Why do we need setting of the ClientProtocolPolicy on the Server<br>
side. The server already gets a chance to express which protocols<br>
should be used/preference by ServerProtocolPolicy. Furthermore,<br>
CORBA spec says that there are some pure client policies, and there<br>
are pure server policies. There can be some that are set on both<br>
client and server, but they should be avoided unless there is a<br>
really good reason for them, since they make things complicated.<br>
Plus the whole resetting to null things on the client is murky... </p>
