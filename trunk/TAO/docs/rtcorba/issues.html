<h4><a name="1">Standard PolicyTypes for RTCORBA policies</a></h4>
<p><a href="http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/99-05-03">ptc/99-05-03</a> does not specify PolicyType values for RTCORBA
policies, so we are using arbitrary values in TAO.&nbsp; When OMG makes standard
PolicyTypes available, we'll need to update TAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Files to update:
orbconf.h and RTCORBA.*</p>

<h4><a name="7">Integrating protocol policies with the Pluggable Protocols
framework</a></h4>
<p><i>RTCORBA::ServerProtocolPolicy</i> and <i>RTCORBA::ClientProtocolPolicy</i>
allow
application developers to select and configure ORB communication protocols, and
to specify preferred order of their use. This functionality has been implemented
in TAO, but is only available when RTCORBA is enabled. Since protocol management
is of interest to a large chunk of TAO users (many of whom do not need RTCORBA
otherwise),
we should make protocol policies available even when RTCORBA is disabled, better
integrate them with the Pluggable Protocols framework, and provide a number of
other enhancements.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Integrate protocol policies with PP framework. Make concrete <i> Protocol_Factories</i>
responsible for creating corresponding <i>ProtocolProperties</i> with default and user-specified
values (rather than having the knowledge about concrete <i>ProtocolProperties </i>embedded in the ORB).&nbsp;
    This will enable the protocol policies to be used to
configure any pluggable protocols without having to modify the ORB code for
each protocol.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Places to update: RT_Policy_i.*, RTCORBA.*, pluggable protocols files,
    ORB_Core::set_default_policies, RTCORBA tests.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Make protocol policies available even when RTCORBA is not enabled. Once
this is done, remove (or deprecate) <i>-ORBSndSock</i>, <i>-ORBRcvSock</i>,
and <i>-ORBNodelay</i> ORB options.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Add support for <i>TCPProtocolProperties::keep_alive</i> and <i>TCPProtocolProperties::dont_route</i>
    in IIOP.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add support for protocol properties configuration in SHMIOP.&nbsp; (SHMIOP
    properties are defined in <i>RTCORBA::SharedMemoryProtocolProperties</i>, but
    are currently not supported in the protocol implementation.)</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="9">Separating RTCORBA features into a library</a></h4>
<p>Following the examples of FT, PortableServer and others, we should factor out
RTCORBA-specific code into a separate library, for all the same good reasons.</p>

<p><a href="#top">[back]</a></p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="10">Integrating Implementation Repository with RTCORBA and PP</a></h4>
<p>Current version of Implementation Repository does not work properly with
RTCORBA or Pluggable Protocols because it does not handle multiple endpoints for
one server.&nbsp; Once RTCORBA implementation is complete, we should look into&nbsp;
redesign of Implementation Repository.</p>

<p><a href="#top">[back]</a></p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="12">Priority Banded Connections interoperability issues</a></h4>
<p>Current implementation of Priority Banded Connections in TAO is not interoperable.&nbsp; TAO does not use <CODE>_bind_priority_band</CODE> operation and <CODE>
RTCorbaPriorityRange</CODE> service context during band establishment. Instead,
the server embeds a proprietary <CODE> TAO_TAG_ENDPOINTS</CODE> tagged component into
an object's
IOR to let the clients know about available priorities and corresponding endpoints. To
establish a banded connection, the client simply uses the endpoint corresponding
to the priority of interest. (See <a href="architecture.html">TAO Real-Time Architecture</a> section for more
details.)</p>
<p>We can provide an alternative interoperable implementation of Priority Banded
Connections by
<ol>
  <li>modifying client to use <CODE> bind_priority_band </CODE> operation and
<CODE> RTCorbaPriorityRange </CODE> service context during band establishment&nbsp;</li>
  <li>modifying server to move a connection to the appropriate reactor once it receives <CODE> bind_priority_band
    </CODE>request and/or <CODE> RTCorbaPriorityRange </CODE> service context&nbsp;</li>
  <li>modifying client to store and
look up connections based on address + priority range rather than just based on
    address alone</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h4><a name="4">Removing TAO::Client_Priority_Policy</a></h4>
<p>TAO-proprietary <i> Client_Priority_Policy</i> is no longer needed - RTCORBA policies
provide the same functionality and more! The policy is not enabled in TAO by default,
and when it is manually enabled, RTCORBA policies cannot be used with it. We
should remove <i> Client_Protocol_Policy</i> and all related code from TAO before the next
release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Involved files: TAO.pidl, Client_Priority_Policy.* Policy_Manager.*,
orbconf.h, Stub.*, Invocation_Endpoint_Selectors.*, ORB_Core.*, tests/Endpoint_per_Priority/*</p>

<p><a href="#top">[back]</a></p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="13">Priority issues in SCHED_OTHER class on Solaris</a></h4>
<p>In RTCORBA tests involving priorities, we are using <CODE>SCHED_OTHER </CODE> scheduling class rather than <CODE>SCHED_FIFO </CODE>.&nbsp;
This is for convenience: no super-user
privileges are
required, and we can run the tests in our daily builds.</p>
<p>On Solaris, the following code</p>
<pre>int max_priority = ACE_Sched_Params::priority_max (ACE_SCHED_OTHER); 
int min_priority = ACE_Sched_Params::priority_min (ACE_SCHED_OTHER);</pre>
<p>produces <i> min_priority</i> of -60 and <i> max_priority</i> of 60.&nbsp; With <i>Direct</i> Priority
Mapping, these native priorities map to CORBA priorities
0 to 120. However, if we try to set a thread's priority to CORBA priority 0, <i>i.e.</i>, native priority -60, the call fails. In general, calls with negative
native priorities fail, and calls with positive native priorities succeed.</p>
<p>When running the tests on Solaris, we use CORBA priority values greater than
60 to get around the problem. However, one would expect that using any of the
valid CORBA priority values for the OS/scheduling class should work.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the proper resolution is, <i>e.g.</i>, whether this is
ok/correct and just needs to be documented, or whether we should be using some
methods different from <CODE> ACE_Sched_Params::priority_max </CODE>and <CODE>priority_min </CODE>to obtain
the valid priority range for a given OS/scheduling class, etc. We need to check
this out.</p>

<h4><a name="2">Removing dependencies on ORB
debug output from RTCORBA tests</a></h4>
<p>Some of the RTCORBA tests rely on ORB debugging output for checking whether
something works. This is <i> very</i> <i> brittle</i> since ORB developers frequently
add/remove/modify debugging messages, causing tests to 'break', and increasing
amount of maintenance effort required. Yet, we somehow need to verify that <i>internally</i> the ORB behaves as we expect, <i>e.g.</i>, a particular transport protocol
is used to carry out an invocation. It may be possible to achieve this without
depending on ORB debug messages by using Portable Interceptors or some other
similar mechanism. For example, we could write several interceptors, which would
obtain and print information of interest for the test. We
should look into this.</p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="5">Improving management of Private Connections</a></h4>
<p>Currently, when the object that has private connections is destroyed, its
connections remain in the cache. We need to implement cleanup of private
connections on object destruction. If such cleanup is expensive, we may
want to have it controlled by an option.</p>

<p><a href="#top">[back]</a></p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="6">Redesigning profile management to satisfy new requirements and
to provide full
support for location forwarding</a></h4>
<p>Current client profile management code needs to change for the
following reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Original design assumed that all threads using the same object reference
    would want to use the same profile for making an invocation. Hence, certain
    state, <i>i.e.</i>, <CODE>profile_in_use, profile_sucess and forward_profiles,
    </CODE>
    is stored per <i>Stub</i>. This assumption no longer holds true, <i>e.g.</i>,
    different threads may have different policies set, and would want to use
    different profiles based on those policies. This is at least the case with
    RTCORBA, where different threads may, for example, want to use different
    protocols. It may also be the case in other scenarios. So, we should not keep
    the state per <i>Stub</i>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Current design does not properly support location forwarding more than one
    level deep.&nbsp; And with certain policy configurations, location
    forwarding is not supported at all.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Current interfaces are very polluted: many tiny functions with similar
    names calling into each other, comments in <i> .h</i> files outdated, comments in
    <i> .cpp</i> files mostly absent.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Lack of thorough test suite.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, redesign of profile management is a good time to add support for
<CODE>TAG_ALTERNATE_IIOP</CODE> (multiple endpoints per profile).</p>
<p>Bala is familiar with profile management code, and has agreed to act as a
consultant/guide when somebody tackles this item.</p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="11">Location forwarding with client-exposed policies</a></h4>
<p>When an object is forwarded, a new set of profiles is received, and they can
potentially include different client-exposed policies. Currently, we don't handle this case,
<i>i.e.</i>, the set of client-exposed policies from the object's original IOR is
used for its complete lifetime. This item is related to the <a href="#6">profile
management</a> issue.</p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="8">Moving FT endpoint selection into the endpoint selector
framework</a></h4>
<p>Selection of endpoints for invocations in TAO is strategized, with strategies for
different policy combinations located in <i>Invocation_Endpoint_Selectors.*</i>&nbsp;
Bala
may want to make FT-based endpoint selection one of the available strategies.
(Currently it's not part of the endpoint selectors framework.)</p>

<hr>
<h4><a name="3">Introducing guidelines for debug output in TAO</a></h4>
<p>Speaking of ORB debug output, there is not much consistency about it in TAO:
not in the use of ORB debug levels, not in the style and detail of debug messages. It is probably a good idea to come up with a short list of
guidelines for debugging messages - this would make the output more useful (if
the guidelines are followed, of course ;-) )</p>
