   <h3>TAO's CORBA Object Services Directory Hierarchy</h3>

    <P>The file and directory organization for TAO services can be
      confusing at first glance (and even on subsequent ones to be
      honest),
      so we felt like some rationale and explanation of the directory
      hierarchy was needed.</P>

    <P>For general sanity all TAO services files are located under
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs</CODE>.</P>

    <P>It is expected that clients use more
      than one service at the same time
      (in fact some of the services already do, for instance the
      <B>Event Service</B> uses the <B>Naming Service</B> and the
      <B>Scheduling Service</B>).
      For this reason all the services stubs are grouped in one
      library.
      This library is located in
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs</CODE>.
      Usually the include path is only <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs</CODE>,
      so files are included like this:</P>

<P><CODE>
#include "orbsvcs/CosNamingC.h"
</CODE></P>

    <P>To simplify the IDL generation the skeletons are also on the
      library,
      this is not a problem for client programs and most services need
      to link the library anyway
      (since they use other services.)
      Further,
      the current support for collocation requires that clients link
      the skeleton files anyway.
    </P>

    <P>In the future we intend to use ACE Service Configurator to give
      the users control over collocation of the services implementation.
      As a first cut all the service implementations are included in the
      orbsvcs library <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs</CODE>.
      Since there are serveral services and each one is implemented
      using several files we have given a different directory to each
      service.
      This structure could also simplify a future split into several
      libraries (if it proves necessary).
    </P>

    <P>The complete list of directories is:</P>

    </TABLE>
    </P>

    <P>Note that in the current version of TAO we still have standalone
      binaries for some of the services.  However, some applications
      may want to control what process implements a particular service.
      Therefore, it has proved useful for
      debugging purposes to keep the most used services separated.
      The binaries in question are located in
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs</CODE>, and the list includes:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Concurrenty_Service</LI>
      <LI>Dump_Schedule</LI>
      <LI>LifeCycle_Service</LI>
      <LI>Event_Service</LI>
      <LI>Naming_Service</LI>
      <LI>Scheduling_Service</LI>
      <LI>Trading_Service</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>In the future we plan to use a single binary and ACE Service
      Configurator and keep a single binary.</P>

    <P>Finally the tests and example programs are located in
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests</CODE>;
      once more each may involves more than a single binary,
      so each one is kept in its own directory;
      the following list describes the contents of each one:
