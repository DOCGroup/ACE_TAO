    <h1>TAO ORB Internals</h1>

    <P>This document will describe how the ORB internals work, with
      special attention to the areas that are more poorly documented.
      For example: we will not document (at least initially) the
      pluggable protocols framework, the interpretive marshaling
      engine, the POA, the waiting strategies and the
      leader-follower.
    </P>
    <P>New ORB developers are expected to read this document and
      document here all the things that they find hard to understand,
      surprizing or event broken.
      New members of the ORB core team are expected to fill in details 
      that were not explained before.
    </P>

    <H3>Client Side event sequence</H3>

    <P>In this section we will document the sequence of calls and
      interactions on the client side.
      Only the synchronous case, without forwarding or exceptions is
      documented at this point.
    </P>

    <P>Assume the application invokes a method on an object reference, 
      in the generated stub for that method the following sequence is
      started:
    <UL>
      <LI>creates TAO_GIOP_Twoway_Invocation object
      </LI>
      <LI>calls start method on the invocation object
      </LI>

      <LI>TAO_GIOP_Twoway_Invocation::start:
	<UL>
	  <LI>finds the profile to use for this invocation
	  </LI>
	  <LI>passes the profile to Connector Registry to obtain 
	    TAO_Transport object (wrapper around Service_Handler)
	  </LI>
	  <LI>generates and marshalls GIOP & Request headers for this
	    invocation
	  </LI>
	</UL>
      </LI>
	
      <LI>marshalls request parameters
      </LI>
      <LI>calls invoke method on the invocation object
      </LI>
  
      <LI>TAO_GIOP_Twoway_Invocation::invoke:
	<UL>
	  <LI>sets TAO_Reply_Dispatcher (this is used to make both
	    synch and asynch requests look the same)
	  </LI>
	  <LI>sends the request
	  </LI>
	  <LI>waits on the TAO_Wait_Strategy
	  </LI>
	</UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>if there was a minor problem or location forward, tries
	    again: call TAO_GIO_Twoway_Invocation::start, etc.
      </LI>
      <LI>if everything went ok, demarshalls reply
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </P>
