    <h1>TAO Trading Service Documentation</h1>
    
    The TAO transient Trading Service implementation conforms to the
    Link Trader conformance criteria as detailed in the COS
    TradingObject Service specification. This document details how to
    use the TAO Trading Service from four perspectives:
    
    <ul> 
      <li> as a importer bootstrapping to the Trading Service,
      <li> as a Service Offer exporter,
      <li> as an out-of-the-box server process,
      <li> as a collocated object.
    </ul> 

    This document assumes you are familiar with Trading Service
    concepts, such as "importer," "exporter", "service type", "service 
    offer," and "dynamic property", as well as the roles of each of
    the Trading Service's interfaces --- <tt>Lookup</tt>,
    <tt>Register</tt>, <tt>Admin</tt>, and Link (the TAO
    implementation doesn't currently support Proxy). I recommend
    reading the first two sections of the <a href =
      "ftp://www.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/97-12-23.pdf">Trading
      Service specification</a> (about 20 pages). This document has
    the following layout:

    <ul>
      <li> The Client Role
        <ul> 
          <li> Bootstrapping to the Trading Service
          <li> The Importer Role --- Performing a Query
            <ul> 
              <li> Constraints
              <li> Preferences
              <li> Filtering Properties 
              <li> Policies
              <li> Offer Iterators
              <li> Property Evaluation
            </ul> 
          <li> The Exporter Role --- Registering a Service Type and Offer
            <ul>
              <li> The Service Type Repository
              <li> Exporting, Deleting, and Modifying Service Offers
              <li> Implementing Dynamic Properties
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <li> The Server Role
        <ul>
          <li> The TAO <tt>Trading_Service</tt> Application
            <ul>
              <li> Command line configuration
              <li> The Multicast Server
            </ul>            
          <li> Colocating the Trading Service in a TAO application
            <ul>
              <li> The <tt>TAO_Trader_Factory</tt> class
              <li> Using the <tt>Admin</tt> and <tt>Link</tt> interface.
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <li> Running the Trading Service Tests
    </ul>
