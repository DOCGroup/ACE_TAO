    Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:cleeland@cs.wustl.edu">Chris Cleeland</A>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>Current status:

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Provides dynamically linked wholesale assignment of ORB
	  strategies for communication, concurrency, demultiplexing,
	  scheduling, and dispatching using the ACE Service
	  Configurator framework.</LI>

	<LI>
	  Supports several concurrency models out of the box:
	  Reactive, Thread-per-Connection, and ORB-per-thread. The
	  ORB-per-thread design is optimized for real-time I/O
	  subsystems.</LI>
      </UL>

      Recently Completed Work:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<li>Debate details of <code>Svc_Handler</code> modifications
	with Irfan.</li>

	<li>Test and commit <code>Connector::connect_n</code> changes
	to ACE</code>.</li>

	<li>ACE & TAO compiling cleanly using Sun's CC on Solaris and
	G++ on Linux.  Also, the ACE tests run properly.</li>

	<li>Use <code>truss</code> to verify for <a
	href="mailto:PAUL.G.WEHLAGE@cdev.com">Paul Wehlage</a> that
	TAO really uses <code>select</code> vs. <code>recv</code> for
	<b>-R</b> vs. <b>-T</b>.</li>

	<li>Rename <code>boa.*</code> to <code>poa.*</code>.</li>

	<LI>Rename following files:&nbsp;Orb_Core.*&nbsp;->orb_core.*
	&amp;&nbsp;orbobj.* -> corba_orb.*.</LI>

	<LI>The lock used in <code>giop.cpp:626</code> originally
	appeared in the IIOP-1.4 code base.  Its purpose was to
	protect access to the <code>fwd_profile</code> data member.
	The original features are available, but they are currently
	not used because none of our concurrency models present a
	thread-unsafe condition.  The <a
	href="../../ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> presents more details on
	the subject.</li>

	<li>Fixed problems seen by <a
	href="mailto:brian.r.mendel@boeing.com">Brian Mendel</a> of
	Boeing where the Cubit server application was crashing in
	<code>TAO_OA_Connection_Handler::handle_message</code> when it
	was trying to call <code>CORBA::POA::handle_request</code>
	through a NULL <code>root_poa</code> pointer.  The NULL
	pointer resulted from the inadvertent use of the
	Thread-per-Connection concurrency model, which is currently
	incompatible with the ORB-per-thread model.  It was not caught
	because the change is normally done in configuration files
	parsed by the Service Configurator, and VxWorks requires
	special code in that area which was not tested until Boeing
	got hold of the code.</li>

	<li>Clean up build under g++.  All 'function used before
	declared inline' warnings have been eliminated.  Also, all
	other warnings (except for one that is nearly unavoidable)
	have been eliminated.
	</li>

	<LI>Remove BOA and ROA names from the ORB.</LI>

	<LI>Change CORBA_ORB::open() to return an error status (first
	cut at this already there--needs to be checked out).</LI>

	<LI>Put README file in multiCubit test.</li>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Ongoing Work:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI>Verify ACE & TAO on Linux.</LI>

	<LI>Use Purify to eliminate straggling problems.</LI>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Critical Work:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<li>Create a section in <a
	href="../../TAO-Install.html"><code>$TAO_ROOT/TAO-Install.html</code></a>
	that documents installation on Unix platforms.  There should
	also be a section documents issues that apply across ALL
	platforms, such as the fact that TAO and its application will
	likely not work well if your ACE is linked through Orbix,
	VisiBroker, or another ORB.
	<a href="../../ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> discovery attribution for
	this should go to <em>Steve Wohlever
	&lt;wohlever@mitre.org&gt;</em>.</li>

	<LI>Implement <code>CORBA_ORB::shutdown()</code> as a manner
	in which a thread of control can request that
	<code>CORBA_ORB::run()</code> should return and no longer
	service requests.</li>

	<LI>Add pre-cached connection on client side.  Clients will
	pass in a comma-separated list of <em>host:port</em>
	destinations using the <code>CORBA::ORB_init()</code>
	interface.</LI>

	<LI>
	  Verify that, in the ORB-per-thread concurrency model, it's
	  possible to have a factory in each thread that creates a
	  client and returns an object reference to that client within
	  that thread.  This is different from the model that Sumedh
	  originally had where the factory was trying to turn out a
	  client in a separate thread/ORB combination.
	  <p>
	  There is no application which attempts this at the moment,
	  so both a client and a server will need to be manufactured.
	  Using existing Cubit-like examples (that poor app is so
	  weary) should reduce development time to a couple of hours.
	</LI>

	<LI>Validate movement of Strategy Connector into ORB&nbsp;Core.</LI>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Future work:
      <UL>

	<li>Implement the <code>CORBA::ORB::shutdown()</code> method
	so that it honors the <em>wait_for_completion</em> flag.

	<li>Get rid of need to have compile in TSS ORB Core
	(<code>-DTAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE</code>).</li>

	<li>Improve the <code>Service Configurator</code> service
	entry faking on VxWorks.</li>

	<LI>There is a bug in the ORB-per-thread concurrency model
	caused by its use of the ACE Service Configurator. The bug is
	understood, and a patch is being readied and should be
	released no later than October 3rd.</LI>

	<LI>The ORB-per-thread model is not yet integrated with the
	other concurrency models; it must be selected at <I>compile
	time</I> rather than run time.  In order to use it, one must
	add <TT>-DTAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE</TT> to the compile line in both
	the library (<TT>$(TAO_ROOT)/tao</TT>) and the application
	(<I>e.g.</I>, <TT>$(TAO_ROOT)/tests/multiCubit</TT>). Future
	releases of TAO will fix this restriction so that all
	threading models are available at run-time.</LI>

	<LI>Support new concurrency models, e.g.,
	Thread-per-Request.</LI>

	<LI>Clean up the internals and analyze for performance bottlenecks using Quantify.</LI>

	<LI>Integrate the <A HREF="#poa">POA</A> implementation.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for <TT>resolve_initial_references</TT> using
	ACE support for UDP broadcast.</LI>

	<LI>Assist in porting higher level services (e.g., <A
	HREF="#eventchannel">Event Channel</A>) to TAO.</LI>

	<li>Compile and verify ACE and TAO on Linux using the Kuck and
	Associates, Inc. (KAI) compiler tools.</li>
