    <BLOCKQUOTE>Current status:

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Provides dynamically linked wholesale assignment of ORB
	  strategies for communication, concurrency, demultiplexing,
	  scheduling, and dispatching using the ACE Service
	  Configurator framework.</LI>

	<LI>
	  Supports several concurrency models out of the box:
	  Reactive, Thread-per-Connection, and ORB-per-thread. The
	  ORB-per-thread design is optimized for real-time I/O
	  subsystems.</LI>
      </UL>

      Recently Completed Work:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI>Remove BOA and ROA names from the ORB.</LI>

	<LI>Change CORBA_ORB::open() to return an error status (first
	cut at this already there--needs to be checked out).</LI>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Ongoing Work:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI>Verify ACE_ & TAO on Linux.</LI>
	<LI>Use Purify to eliminate straggling problems.</LI>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Critical Work:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI>Use Purify to track down problems Brian has found.
	<em>Brian is checking out some suggestions, so this will be
	deferred pending his results.</em></LI>

	<LI>Add pre-cached connection on client side.  Clients will
	pass in a comma-separated list of <em>host:port</em>
	destinations using the <code>CORBA::ORB_init()</code>
	interface.</LI>

	<LI>Validate movement of Strategy Connector into ORB&nbsp;Core.</LI>

	<LI>Put README file in multiCubit test.</li>

	<LI>The lock used in <code>giop.cpp:626</code> originally
	appeared in the IIOP-1.4 code base.  Its purpose was to
	protect access to the <code>fwd_profile</code> data member.
	We're not using the forward feature right now, so we could
	eliminate it entirely.  The smarter move is probably to fold
	the lock into <code>IIOP_Object</code> and only make it
	available through an accessor method.  This translates into
	the following TODO:</LI>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <ul>
	    <LI>Move <code>lock_</code> member from
	    <code>TAO_GIOP_Invocation</code> into
	    <code>IIOP_Object</code>.</li>

	    <li>Make <code>IIOP_Object::fwd_profile</code>
	    private.</li>

	    <li>Create accessors for
	    <code>IIOP_Object::fwd_profile</code>.</li>

	    <li>Make all references to
	    <code>IIOP_Object::fwd_profile</code> through the
	    accessors.</li>
	  </ul>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>
	  Verify that, in the ORB-per-thread concurrency model, it's
	  possible to have a factory in each thread that creates a
	  client and returns an object reference to that client within
	  that thread.  This is different from the model that Sumedh
	  originally had where the factory was trying to turn out a
	  client in a separate thread/ORB combination.
	  <p>
	  There is no application which attempts this at the moment,
	  so both a client and a server will need to be manufactured.
	  Using existing Cubit-like examples (that poor app is so
	  weary) should reduce development time to a couple of hours.
	</LI>

	<LI>Implement <code>CORBA_ORB::shutdown()</code> as a manner
	in which a thread of control can request that
	<code>CORBA_ORB::run()</code> should return and no longer
	service requests.</li>

	<LI>Rename following files:&nbsp;Orb_Core.*&nbsp;->orb_core.*
	&amp;&nbsp;orbobj.* -> corba_orb.*.</LI>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Future work:
      <UL>

	<LI>There is a bug in the ORB-per-thread concurrency model
	caused by its use of the ACE Service Configurator. The bug is
	understood, and a patch is being readied and should be
	released no later than October 3rd.</LI>

	<LI>The ORB-per-thread model is not yet integrated with the
	other concurrency models; it must be selected at <I>compile
	time</I> rather than run time.  In order to use it, one must
	add <TT>-DTAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE</TT> to the compile line in both
	the library (<TT>$(TAO_ROOT)/tao</TT>) and the application
	(<I>e.g.</I>, <TT>$(TAO_ROOT)/tests/multiCubit</TT>). Future
	releases of TAO will fix this restriction so that all
	threading models are available at run-time.</LI>

	<LI>Support new concurrency models, e.g.,
	Thread-per-Request.</LI>

	<LI>Clean up the internals and analyze for performance bottlenecks using Quantify.</LI>

	<LI>Integrate the <A HREF="#poa">POA</A> implementation.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for <TT>resolve_initial_references</TT> using
	ACE support for UDP broadcast.</LI>

	<LI>Assist in porting higher level services (e.g., <A
	HREF="#eventchannel">Event Channel</A>) to TAO.</LI>
      </UL>
