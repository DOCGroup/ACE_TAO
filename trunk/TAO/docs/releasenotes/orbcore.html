<a name="current"><h3>Current status:</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li><p>Trying to figure out a better <em>resource</em> management
      scheme.  <em>Resouces</em> here include ORB, POA, connections,
      profiles.... that provide services for CORBA invocations.</p>

<a name="issues"><h3>Known issues:</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li><p>Since collocated objects run in the client thread's context,
      calling <code>CORBA::ORB::shutdown()</code> does <em>not</em>
      actually close down the target ORB but instead on the client
      side ORB.  This issue will be addressed in the new ORB Core
      architecture.</p>

      <p>Also, since the collocated invocations circumvent POA
      completely, POA Current won't get set up, LOCATION_FORWARD will
      not work, race condition may occur when several threads invoke
      operations on an objects registered with POAs with SINGLE_THREAD
      policy, operation invocations will still get thru even the POA
      is in holding state, or invoking operations on a servant that
      has already been deactivated.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>When using the thread-per-connection concurrency model, if
      some client leave the socket connection open without sending any
      request, the server will crash on NT.  This is because we are
      doing a blocking recv when a server connection handler acts as
      an active object, and the recv won't break out until the process
      gets kill by the OS.  This is especially a problem on NT becuase
      on shutdown, NT close down the socket service, which cause the
      blocking recv to unblock at which point, these threads try to
      access the already destroyed ORB resources.  A temporary
      workaround is to close the sockets when the ORB is shutting
      down.  But this is not portable and only works on NT.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Some CORBA objects need to have access to the ORB. We tend to
      use <code>TAO_ORB_Core_instance()->orb()</code> to fetch the
      right ORB the object is using. This is most often true when
      implementing the shutdown method which allow other process to
      shutdown a remote ORB. Althought this may be the "right" thing
      to do in TAO, it is not CORBA compliant and hurts the
      portability of object implementation.  A common way of getting
      around this problem is to cache the ORB pointer in the object
      when it is created and simply use the cached ORB when needed.
      However, remember that there could be multiple ORBs in a process
      and a POA may be shared by several ORBs. That means, we may not
      handling the object with the same ORB it was
      created. Collocation optimization further complicated the
      problem.</p>

      <p> At the moment, using
      <code>TAO_ORB_Core_instance()->orb()</code> is the only sane way
      to get arond the problem. Though there may be a better way.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Object references for objects dynamically created within a
      server may not have proper host. When an object is dynamically
      created and its object reference returned, it simply has to
      "guess" at the host information that is returned in the IIOP
      Profile.  Currently, it guesses using the host name, which is a
      reasonable guess in most cases.  However, if there are multiple
      interfaces on a machine <em>and</em> they have different host
      names, it is possible that the desired effect will not be
      realized, i.e., the connection to that new object may use a
      different interface from the original object. Currently the only
      way to change this is to use the <A
      HREF="../Options.html#-ORBhost"><b>-ORBhost</b> option</a> to
      manually specify that dynamically-created objects bind to a
      specific interface so that their IIOP Profile has the desired
      hostname. A more desirable fix is being investigated.</p>

<a name="future"><h3>Future work:</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li>Performance optimizations, such as:</li>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Replace all uses of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>
            with allocators that can be put into TSS. The main
            motivation for this is to eliminate lock contention when
            multiple threads need to allocate/deallocate memory,
            however it might also be possible to substitute an
            allocator better-tuned to an application's specific
            usage.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

  <li>Robustness improvements:</li>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Improve connection cache so that it won't crash when
            there are no more slots or sockets.
        </li>

        <li><p>Add an option to the ORB core, e.g.,
            <b>-ORBnameservicetimeout</b>, to allow specification of
            an upper bound on the itime-to-wait for a response from
            the ORB's multicast "search" for a running name server.<p>
        </li>
      </ol>

  <li>New features:</li>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Implement <code>ORB::perform_work</code> and
            <code>ORB::work_pending</code> so that <code>ORB::run</code>
            <em>could</em> be implemented in terms of them.</p>
        </li>

        <li><p>Implement <code>RT-CORBA</code> spec. once it passes
            OMG member vote.</p>
        </li>

        <li><p>Added support for CORBA Messaging Spec.</p>
      </ol>

  <li>Internal restructuring:</li>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Create some sort of internal "request" object which
            carries enough context to suport deferred method
            invocation such as one might find in the thread-pool
            approach or wherever queuing might occur.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

  <li>Documentation:</li>
        <li><p>Writing up ORB restructuring notes.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

  <li>Potential Optimizations:</li>

      <ol>
        <li><p>There is a certain amount of overhead introduced by the
            use of TSS Singletons. TSS singletons are very convenient
            as the variable does not have to be passed from function
            to function. Even though sort of access is generally
            acceptable, the overhead of this approach maybe too high
            when used in code which is executed frequently (e.g.,
            during an upcall). This critical code may have to be
            restructured not to use TSS Singletons because of the high
            overhead associated with it.</p>

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
<!-- Please make sure you append new items at the end of the list -->
<!-- ************************************************************ -->
<ul>
  <li><p>Provides dynamically linked wholesale assignment of ORB
      strategies for communication, concurrency, demultiplexing,
      scheduling, and dispatching using the ACE Service Configurator
      framework.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Supports several concurrency models out of the box: Reactive,
      Thread-per-Connection, and ORB-per-thread. The ORB-per-thread
      design is optimized for real-time I/O subsystems. (See: <A
      HREF="../configurations.html">Configuration Guide</a>.)</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Supports <code>resolve_initial_references("&lt;CORBA
      Service>")</code> using ACE support for multicast. <em>(TAO
      proprietary.)</em></p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Support both native C++ exceptions and
      <code>CORBA::Environment</code> based exceptions handling.</p>

  <li><p>Support for TAO proprietary <code>-ORBgioplite</code>
      command-line option.  When this option is enabled the ORB
      removes a few fields of the GIOP messages that are normally not
      used, such as the version numbers, the magic 'GIOP' string, the
      service context, the Principal object, etc. This option give us
      a slight performance improvement but it is important for
      extremely low-latency systems (such as avionics), that
      fortunately have tightly controlled environments so this kind of
      optimization is safe to use.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>The buffers for outgoing CDR streams are allocated from TSS
      memory pools, reducing locking on the critical path.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Several optimizations on the critical path have been
      implemented, carefully removing excesive locking, memory
      allocations and data copying. In some cases special demarshaling
      and marshaling functions where written for the request
      headers.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Adding a new option into TAO_Resource_Factory to control the
      internal lock used by ORB's reacotr. With "<code>-ORBreactorlock
      null</code>" added into <code>svc.conf</code>, you can eliminate
      the token inside the Select_Reactor inside the ORB even on
      multi-threaded platforms. This eliminate some overheads caused
      by synchronizing access to the Select_Reactor. Usually, if you
      have TSS ORB and are using reactive concurrency startegy, the
      ORB are not accessed by multiple threads, then, you can safely
      turn the lock off.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Strategized the connection management scheme so that we don't
      always have to pay the price of a look up in the connection
      cache. Basically, we "hold" a service handler for a string of
      requests.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>There is no need to call ORB::open if the port is 0. It will
      automagically be called when the first stub is created.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>The ORB now handles nested upcalls correctly. See <a
      href="../leader_follower.html">this </a>for details on the
      design of the solution.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Added optimization for collocated objects. This optimization
      enables TAO to bypass communication layers and talks to
      collocated objects directly.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Making the collocation table configurable. We can either use
      a global collocation table to share objects among ORBs, or use
      the per-ORB collocation table.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Implement the inheritance mechanism in
      Default_Server_Connection_Handler to access the parent's
      POA. This is necessary when we are using thread-per-connection
      concurrency model.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>It is often desireable for a server to start up and not have
      to specify the TCP port number on which the ORB will listen,
      i.e., let the OS decide.  While this works properly (by
      providing an argument <code>-ORBport 0</code>), the actual port
      number used by the server won't be available after the server
      starts listening. TAO now tries to bind the address when
      <code>-ORBport 0</code> is issued so it can get the actual
      address to publish the IOR for clients' use.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Broke the tight coupling between <code>CORBA_Object</code>
      and <code>IIOP_Object</code> so that multiple
      <code>CORBA_Object</code>s can share a single
      <code>IIOP_Object</code>. This has a big win in
      <code>_narrow</code> operations.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>The ORBs manipulation of object keys and object ids is now
      consistent. Canonically, everything is managed as an opaque
      sequence of octets. Conversion to/from strings is permitted,
      with non-printables turning into a trigraph <b>\hl</b> where
      <b>h</b> is the high nibble digit in hex, and <b>l</b> is the
      low nibble in hex.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><code>CORBA_ORB::run()</code> should be able to be called
      multiply in the same execution path now.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Fixed the <b>LOCATION_FORWARD</b> capabilities to work as
      described in the CORBA 2.1 and the POA specification.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Support for <b><a
      href="../Options.html#-ORBsndsock">-ORBsndsock</a></b> and <b><a
      href="../Options.html#-ORBrcvsock">-ORBrcvsock</a></b> ORB
      options. See <a href="../Options.html">options documentation</a>
      for details.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Support for connections pre-establishment using the <b><a
      href="../Options.html#-ORBpreconnect">-ORBpreconnect</a></b>
      option. This allows connections to be esablished before any
      CORBA requests are made. See <a href="../Options.html">options
      documentation</a> for details.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Placed an optimization in IIOP::Profile that should speed up
      invocations on the client side rather substantially. This was
      done by caching an instance of <code>ACE_INET_Addr</code> in the
      private portion of <code>Profile</code> because the cost of
      constructing one for every invocation (in
      <code>TAO_GIOP_Invocation::start</code>) was simply
      enormous--the construction was something like 100 cycles on
      Solaris. This is all because deep down this ends up calling
      <code>gethostbyname()</code>, which can be very costly. Of
      course, this is platform-dependent, so the improvements may not
      be as great on a different platform.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Eliminated need for <code>CORBA::Object</code> to keep a
      pointer to its orb sitting around anywhere.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Tested <code>CORBA_ORB::shutdown()</code> as a manner in
      which a thread of control can request that
      <code>CORBA_ORB::run()</code> should return and no longer
      service requests. It only honors a <em>wait_for_completion</em>
      argument of <b>FALSE</b> right now because we haven't fully
      explored the issues which surround doing all the completion.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Implemented <code>CORBA_ORB::shutdown()</code> as a manner in
      which a thread of control can request that
      <code>CORBA_ORB::run()</code> should return and no longer
      service requests.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Support for the -ORBInitRef option. This allows run-time
      specification of an ObjectId:IOR mapping. It is used by
      resolve_initial_references () and overrides the orb-install-time
      defaults.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>minimal support for CORBA Contexts. This is an inherently
      un-typesafe feature, and many believe it will disappear from
      CORBA eventually, but in order to make _create_request()
      compliant, we have added a CORBA_Context class. The only
      permissible value for a Context pointer passed as an argument to
      _create_request is 0. If a non-zero pointer is passed, a
      NO_IMPLEMENT exception is raised.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Support configuring TAO's component as both static and
      dynamic services.   Improve robustness of setting default
      svc.conf entries.  See <a
      href="../configurations.html#programming">Configuration
      Document</a> for details.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>TAO now understands <a
      href="index.html#nservices">Interoperable Naming Service</a>'s
      <code>iioploc://</code> and <code>iiopname://</code>
      formats.</p>
  </li>
