    <H3><A NAME="idl"></A>IDL Compiler</H3>
    Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:gokhale@cs.wustl.edu">Andy Gokhale</A>

    <P> Features </P>
    <UL>
      <LI> Many IDL constructs supported including primitive types,
          typedefs, sequences, structures, and unions. </LI>

      <LI> Generated code closely follows the C++ Mapping specified in
          the POA Specification (ORBOS/97-05-15). </LI>

      <LI> Generates C++ stubs and skeletons that use TAO's <A
          HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/HICSS-97.ps.gz">interpretive IIOP protocol
          engine</A>.  </LI>

    </UL>

  <P> Unsupported/buggy Features </P>
  <UL>
	<LI>Works for <I>most</I> IDL constructs. Some of the known
            bugs/incomplete tasks are:
            <UL>
              <LI>
                  Sequences of strings and object references may still
                  pose problems </LI>

              <LI>
                  TypeCode generation for multidimensional arrays and
                  indirected typecodes is still a problem. </LI>

              <LI>
                  Exceptions are not well-supported. TAO does not use
                  C++ Exceptions. Instead we use the alternative
                  mapping that uses CORBA::Environment. </LI>

              <LI>
                  Some problems noticed when IDL files are included
                  and definitions from included files are used.</LI>
            </UL>
        </LI>
      </UL>

      Upcoming tasks:
      <UL>

	<LI>Improve IDL compiler to support complete IDL-to-C++ mapping.</LI>

	<LI>Fix bugs in the SunSoft IDL front-end we've
            uncovered. These primarily include support for Unions.</LI>

        <LI>Add command line options to TAO IDL. These options will
            decide what strategy to use for operation name
            demultiplexing. Another option may decide whether to use
            the interpretive IIOP engine or generate compiled
            stubs/skeletons. </LI>

	<LI>Use <A
	HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/flick/">Flick</A>
	(from the University of Utah) to generate compiled stubs.</LI>

	<LI>Goal is to measure the code size of the interpretive stubs
	generated by TAO IDL compiler <I>vs</I> code size of compiled
	stubs. Then compare the performance of each. We want to prove
	the thesis that TAO IDL compiler generated interpretive stubs
	have a small code size, yet are comparable in performance (or
	slightly less) than compiled stubs. Hence, it will be useful
	for small distributed equipment such as handsets, PDAs,
	etc.</LI>

	<LI>In doing the above, improvements to the IIOP protocol
	engine in terms of size/performance/determinism will be
	made.</LI>
      </UL>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="eventchannel"></A>Real-time Event Channel</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:coryan@cs.wustl.edu">Carlos O'Ryan</A>

<P>Current status:
<UL>
<LI>
The current Event Channel is running under Orbix, fully distributed, the
main test has three processes, one runs the EC itself, one a Supplier and
yet another a Consumer.</LI>

<LI>
The configuration runs can be done even on the distributed scenario, using
the Real-time "Scheduling Service", which now has an IDL interface.</LI>

<LI>
At run-time (no config runs) there is no need to use the Real-time Scheduling
Service, a faster, collocated implementation for the service is available.
Obviously the information is generated on the config runs and linked into
the program.</LI>

<LI>
We are using an implementation of the standard <A HREF="#naming">Naming
Service</A> for Orbix.</LI>
</UL>
Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Port to TAO (once IDL compiler is available and stable).</LI>

<LI>
The Scheduling Service is completely independant of the EC and the configuration
of suppliers or consumers. I think it would be convenient to have a library
and binaries for it, including a tool to dump the results in a C++ compilable
form.</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="apps"></A>Test &amp; Example Applications</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:sumedh@cs.wustl.edu">Sumedh Mungee</A>

<P>Current status:

<P>The TAO test application is meant to serve as a starting point for real-time
tests on the TAO system. It comprises the following parts:
<UL>
<LI>

<I>Server.</I> The server creates multiple CORBA objects (servants),
each with different real-time priorities. This priority is implemented
by using real-time thread support provided by the operating
system. Thus, requests sent to a high-priority servant are handled by
a high-priority real-time thread, and those sent to a lower priority
servant are handled by correspondingly lower priority threads. <P>

<LI>
<I>Client.</I> The client component binds to the servants, and sends a
stream of CORBA requests to the servants. It measures the response time,
i.e. the time taken for the request to complete successfully. In particular,
it measures the time taken for requests sent to the high priority servant
to complete. The volume of lower priority requests is configurable. The
client is thus able to measure the performance of the high-priority servant
in the presence of competition from several lower-priority servants.</LI>
</UL>
Clearly, if the ORB endsystem handles the priorities of the various requests
correctly, increasing the volume of lower priority requests should not
affect the performance seen by the higher priority requests. The application
thus serves as a tool to measure and confirm this behavior.

<P>Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Study the impacts of scheduling &amp; concurrency strategies on performance.</LI>

<LI>
Evolve into a testbed for discovering sources of performance non-determinism
&amp; priority inversion.</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="poa"></A>Portable Object Adapter</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:irfan@cs.wustl.edu">Irfan Pyarali</A>

<P>Current Status:
<UL>
<LI>
The POA is not integrated into this release, though we've begun migrating
TAO's OA to use POA method names.</LI>
</UL>
Critical work:

<UL>
<LI>
Re-generate win32 project files with new file names.</LI>

<LI>
Add resolve_initial_references() to resolve the "RootPOA" entry.</LI>
</UL>

Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Mostly compliant with the <A HREF="http://siesta.cs.wustl.edu/~cleeland/tao/POA.pdf">ORB
Portability Specifications [orbos/97-05-15]</A> published by OMG.</LI>

<LI>
Provide extensions of the specification to ensure real-time delivery of
messages.</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="nservices"></A>CORBA Naming Service</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:sergio@cs.wustl.edu">Sergio
Flores-Gaitan</A> and <A HREF="mailto:marina@cs.wustl.edu">Marina
Spivak</A><P>

The Naming Service is a non-persistent implementation of the OMG Naming
Service specification.

<P>Current status:
<UL>
<LI>
This implementation works on ORBIX 2.0.</LI>
</UL>
Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Testing the implementation ported to TAO.  There is a bug in the sequence
marshalling of Name.  After that is fixed, it should run ok.
</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="tservices"></A>CORBA Trader Service</H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:sbw1@cs.wustl.edu">Seth Widoff</A> <P>

The Trading Service is an implementation conforming to OMG Trading
Service specification.

<P>Current status:
<UL>
<LI>
This is a simple trader (registers/withdraws/describes offers and does
constraint based lookup for those offers) working on VisiBroker 2.0 v1.51.</LI>
</UL>
Future work:
<UL>
<LI>
Port to TAO.</LI>

<LI>
Implement Type Repository and Admin Interfaces for Trading Service.</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="ace"></A>ORB-related ACE Changes</H3>
Points of contact: <A HREF="mailto:cleeland@cs.wustl.edu">Chris Cleeland</A> and <A HREF="mailto:irfan@cs.wustl.edu">Irfan Pyrarli</A>

      <P>Task List:

      <ul>
	<li>Insure that the Reactor_Performance_Test portion that
	tests <code>connect_n</code> adequately tests for failures.  I
	don't think it's doing that right now, so the newly-added code
	doesn't address it.</li>

	<li>Insure that the interface for <code>connect_n</code> works
	with the Cached Connector.  Perhaps Irfan can try this in the
	Connect Test?</li>

	<li>Fix <code>strsplit_r()</code> (waiting on response from
	user having problems).</li>

	<li>The current caching connector does not behave properly in
	the face of a non-blocking connect request.  The "fix" is
	simply to not support non-blocking connects through the cache.
	When the <code>connect()</code> fails with
	<code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, morph the error to -1 and clean up
	the request.</li>

	<li>Service handlers obtained from the caching connector are
	not cleaned up.  The application needs to be able to signal
	that it's not using it any longer, and, when the application
	encounters an error, needs to effectively close down that
	connection for good so that a new connection can be initiated.
	We're still working through the details on how to accomplish
	this.</li>

      </ul>
