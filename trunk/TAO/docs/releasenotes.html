  <P>Current status:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Provides dynamically linked wholesale assignment of ORB strategies for
    communication, concurrency, demultiplexing, scheduling, and dispatching
    using the ACE Service Configurator framework.
    <LI>Supports several concurrency models out of the box: Reactive,
    Thread-per-Connection, and ORB-per-thread.  The ORB-per-thread design
    is optimized for real-time I/O subsystems.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>There is a bug in the ORB-per-thread concurrency model caused by its
    use of the ACE Service Configurator.  The bug is understood,
    and a patch is being readied and should be released no later than October 3rd.
    <LI>The ORB-per-thread model is not yet integrated with the other concurrency
    models; it must be selected at <EM>compile time</EM> rather than run time.
    In order to use it, one must add <CODE>-DTAO_HAS_TSS_ORBCORE</CODE> to the compile
    line in both the library (<code>$(TAO_ROOT)/tao</code>) and the application
    (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>$(TAO_ROOT)/tests/multiCubit</code>).  Future releases of
    TAO will fix this restriction so that all threading models are available at run-time. 
    <LI>Add Orbix-like <CODE>_bind</CODE> calls in lieu of always needing a Naming Service.
    <LI>Support new concurrency models, e.g., Thread-per-Request.
    <LI>Clean up the internals and analyze for performance bottlenecks using
    Quantify.
    <LI>Integrate the <A HREF="#poa">POA</A> implementation.
    <LI>Add support for <CODE>resolve_initial_references</CODE> using ACE support for UDP broadcast.
    <LI>Assist in porting higher level services (e.g., <A HREF="#eventchannel">Event
    Channel</A>) to TAO.

  <P>Current status</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Generates C++ stubs and skeletons that use TAO's <A HREF="HICSS-97.ps.gz">interpretive IIOP protocol engine</A>. 
    <LI>Works for <EM>most</EM> IDL constructs. Although code is generated
    for everything, support for unions, sequences whose element types are anonymous
    sequences or strings, arrays of strings, and other very complicated types
    may result in C++ compilation errors.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Improve IDL compiler to support complete IDL-to-C++ mapping.
    <LI>Fix bugs in the SunSoft IDL front-end we've uncovered.
    <LI>Use <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/flick/">Flick</A>
    (from the University of Utah) to generate compiled stubs.
    <LI>Goal is to measure the code size of the interpretive stubs generated
    by TAO IDL compiler <I>vs</I> code size of compiled stubs. Then compare
    the performance of each. We want to prove the thesis that TAO IDL compiler
    generated interpretive stubs have a small code size, yet are comparable
    in performance (or slightly less) than compiled stubs. Hence, it will be
    useful for small distributed equipment such as handsets, PDAs, etc.
    <LI>In doing the above, improvements to the IIOP protocol engine in terms
    of size/performance/determinism will be made.

Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:coryan@cs.wustl.edu">Carlos O'Ryan</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Current status:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>The current real-time Event Channel is running under Orbix, fully distributed.
        The main test has three processes, one runs the EC itself, one a
	 Supplier and yet another a Consumer. 
    <LI>The configuration runs can be done even on the distributed scenario,using
    the Real-time Scheduling Service, which now has an IDL interface.
    <LI>At run-time (no config runs) there is no need to use the
	 Real-time Scheduling Service, a faster, collocated
	 implementation for the service is available. 
    Obviously, the information is generated on the config runs and linked into
    the program.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Port to TAO (once IDL compiler is available and stable).
    <LI>Change to use standard Naming Service rather than current Orbix <CODE>_bind</CODE>/<CODE>_marker</CODE>
    calls.
    <LI>The <A HREF="#naming">Naming Service</A> must be ported to TAO in order
    for suppliers and consumers to obtain an object reference to the Event
    Channel in a portable and reliable fashion.
    <LI>The Scheduling Service is completely independant of the EC and the
    configuration of suppliers or consumers. I think it would be convenient
    to have a library and binaries for it, including a tool to dump the results
    in a C++ compilable form.

  <P>Current status:</P>
  <P>The TAO test application is meant to serve as a starting point for real-time
  tests on the TAO system. It comprises the following parts:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI><EM>Server.</EM> The server creates multiple CORBA objects (servants),
    each with different real-time priorities. This priority is implemented
    by using real-time thread support provided by the operating system. Thus,
    requests sent to a high-priority servant are handled by a high-priority
    real-time thread, and those sent to a lower priority servant are handled
    by correspondingly lower priority threads.
    <LI><EM>Client.</EM> The client component binds to the servants, and sends
    a stream of CORBA requests to the servants. It measures the response time,
    i.e. the time taken for the request to complete successfully. In particular,
    it measures the time taken for requests sent to the high priority servant
    to complete. The volume of lower priority requests is configurable. The
    client is thus able to measure the performance of the high-priority servant
    in the presence of competition from several lower-priority servants.
  </UL>
  <P>Clearly, if the ORB endsystem handles the priorities of the various
  requests correctly, increasing the volume of lower priority requests should
  not affect the performance seen by the higher priority requests. The application
  thus serves as a tool to measure and confirm this behavior.</P>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Study the impacts of scheduling &amp; concurrency strategies on performance.
    <LI>Evolve into a testbed for discovering sources of performance non-determinism
    &amp; priority inversion.
  </UL>

    Portability Specifications [orbos/97-05-15]</A> published by OMG.

    of messages.
