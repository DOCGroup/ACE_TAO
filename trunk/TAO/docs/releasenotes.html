<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Release Information</H1>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Version 0.8b ?which?</H3>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Roadmap</H2>

<P>Information is available on the following topics:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="#orb">ORB &amp; ORB Core</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#idl">IDL Compiler</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#eventchannel">Event Channel</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#apps">Test &amp; Example Applications</A>

</UL>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="orb"></A>ORB &amp; ORB Core</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Current status:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Provides dynamically linked wholesale strategy assignment using the
    ACE Service Configurator framework.
    <LI>Supports several concurrency models out of the box: Reactive, Thread-per-connection,
    and ORB-per-thread. Others can be easily crafted.
    <LI>The ORB-per-thread model is not well integrated with the other concurrency
    models; it must be selected at <EM>compile time</EM> rather than run time.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Add Orbix-like <CODE>bind</CODE> calls.
    <LI>Better integrate ORB-per-thread.
    <LI>Clean up the internals and analyze for performance bottlenecks using
    Quantify.
    <LI>Integrate with <A HREF="#poa">POA</A> work.
    <LI>Add support for <CODE>resolve_initial_references</CODE>.
    <LI>Assist in porting higher level services (e.g., <A HREF="#eventchannel">Event
    Channel</A>) to TAO.
  </UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="idl"></A>IDL Compiler</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Current status</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Generates stubs and skeletons which use the interpretive IIOP marshaling
    engine.
    <LI>Works with <EM>most</EM> IDL constructs. Although code is generated
    for everything, support for unions, sequences whose element types are anonymous
    sequences or strings, arrays of strings, and other very complicated types
    may result in compilation errors.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Improve IDL compiler
    <LI>Fix bugs in the SunSoft IDL front-end uncovered by us.
    <LI>Use <A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/flick/">Flick</A>
    (from the University of Utah) to generate compiled stubs.
    <LI>Goal is to measure the code size of the interpretive stubs generated
    by TAO IDL compiler <I>vs</I> code size of compiled stubs. Then compare
    the performance of each. We want to prove the thesis that TAO IDL compiler
    generated interpretive stubs have a small code size, yet are comparable
    in performance (or slightly less) than compiled stubs. Hence, it will be
    useful for small distributed equipment such as handsets, PDAs, etc.
    <LI>In doing the above, improvements to the IIOP protocol engine in terms
    of size/performance will be made.
  </UL>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="eventchannel"></A>Event Channel</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Current status:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>The current Event Channel is running under Orbix, fully distributed,
    the main test I've running has three processes, one runs the EC itself,
    one a Supplier and yet another a Consumer.
    <LI>The configuration runs can be done even on the distributed scenario,using
    a IDL &quot;Scheduling Service&quot;.
    <LI>At run-time (no config runs) there is no need to use the Scheduling
    Service, a faster, collocated implementation for the service is available.
    Obviously the information is generated on the config runs and linked into
    the program.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Port to TAO (on availability of stable IDL compiler).
    <LI>Change to use standard naming service rather than current Orbix <CODE>_bind</CODE>/<CODE>_marker</CODE>
    calls.
    <LI>The <A HREF="#naming">Naming Service</A> must be ported to TAO in order
    for suppliers and consumers to obtain an object reference to the Event
    Channel in a portable and reliable fashion.
    <LI>The Scheduling Service is completely independant of the EC and the
    configuration of suppliers or consumers. I think it would be convenient
    to have a library and binaries for it, including a tool to dump the results
    in a C++ compilable form.

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="apps"></A>Test &amp; Example Applications</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Current status:</P>
  <P>The TAO test application is meant to serve as a starting point for real-time
  tests on the TAO system. It comprises the following parts:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI><EM>Server.</EM> The servant component creates multiple CORBA objects
    (servants), each with different real-time priorities. This priority is
    implemented by using real-time thread support provided by the operating
    system. Thus, requests sent to a high-priority servant are handled by a
    high-priority real-time thread, and those sent to a lower priority servant
    are handled by correspondingly lower priority threads.
    <LI><EM>Client.</EM> The client component binds to the servant objects,
    and sends a stream of CORBA requests to the servants. It measures the response
    time, i.e. the time taken for the request to complete successfully. In
    particular, it measures the time taken for requests sent to the high priority
    servant to complete. The volume of lower priority requests is configurable.
    The client is thus able to measure the performance of the high-priority
    servant in the presence of competition from several lower-priority servants.
    <LI>Clearly, if the ORB endsystem handles the priorities of the various
    requests correctly, increasing the volume of lower priority requests should
    not affect the performance seen by the higher priority requests. The application
    thus serves as a tool to measure and confirm this behavior.
  </UL>
  <P>Future work:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Study the impact of scheduling &amp; concurrency strategies on performance.
    <LI>Evolve into a testbed for discovering sources of performance non-determinism
    &amp; priority inversion.
  </UL>

    Portability Specifications [orbos/97-05-15]</A> published by OMG.
    <LI>Provide extensions of the specification to ensure real-time delivery
    of messages.

    constraint based lookup for those offers) working on VisiBroker 2.0 v1.51.
