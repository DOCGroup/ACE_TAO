    <br/>Release Notes
    </h1>

    <b>D</b>eployment <b>An</b>d <b>C</b>onfiguration <b>E</b>ngine
    <b>(DAnCE)</b> is an implementation of the run-time infrastructure as
    mandated by the recently adopted OMG <a
    href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2003-07-02">Deployment &amp;
    Configuration (D&amp;C)</a> specification, which deals with the
    configuration and deployment of component-based applications. Currently
    DAnCE only supports the deployment &amp; configuration of CORBA
    Component Model (CCM) based applications. DAnCE needs XML descriptors
    which drive the deployment to be provided to it, to actually perform
    the deployment. One way to generate these descriptors is using the
    <b>Co</b>mponent <b>S</b>ynthesis using <b>M</b>odel-<b>I</b>ntegrated
    <b>C</b>omputing (<a
    href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/cosmic">CoSMIC</a>) tool-suite.
    DAnCE uses <b>C</b>omponent <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>A</b>CE <b>O</b>RB (<a
    href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO">CIAO</a>) is used as the
    underlying CCM implementation in the current release.

    <h2>D&amp;C XML Schema Handling</h2>

    <p> The XML handlers shipped with DAnCE are capable of handling almost
    all elements that are defined in the schema. Handling here refers to
    reading the XML tags and converting them to the equivalent in-memory
    IDL based data structures defined by the specifications. Some of the
    elements are however not handled. The list of XML elements that are not
    supported at this time are listed below:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:Any</code></b> &mdash; This is a complex
        element which is composed of many sub-elements. Currently, DAnCE only
        parses a subset of the sub-elements of <code>Deployment:Any</code>.
        Specifically, DAnCE supports all the basic data types defined as part
        of <code>Deployment:Any</code>, and doesn't understand any of the
        complex types.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>xmi:Extension</code></b> &mdash; This element is designed to
        allow augmenting the standard D&amp;C schema with user-defined
        elements. Currently DAnCE doesn't support user-defined extensions to
        the schema.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:Requirement</code></b> &mdash; This element is
        designed to allow description of requirements of component-based
        applications. Since handling this requires interaction with the
        <code>TargetManager</code> interface(which is unsupported at this
        time), support for handling it is not present.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:ComponentPropertyDescription</code></b> &mdash;
        This element is used to specify default values for attributes of
        component. DAnCE doesn't support setting the values for attributes
        of components using this tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:ComponentExternalPortEndpoint,
        Deployment:ExternalReferenceEndpoint</code></b> &mdash; These
        elements are used specify connections between ports of components
        in one assembly with ports of components in a different assembly,
        or connections between component ports and external connection
        endpoints. These features are needed for supporting assemblies of
        components. DAnCE doesn't support hierarchical assemblies i.e.,
        creation of assemblies which can themselves contain sub-assemblies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:PlanPropertyMapping</code></b> &mdash; This
        element is used to delegate property mapping between a component's
        external properties to properties of subcomponents that actually
        implement the behavior of the larger component. Since DAnCE
        doesn't support hierarchical assemblies, this tag is not supported
        currently.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>D&amp;C Management Interfaces</h2> <p> D&amp;C specification
    defines a set of standard CORBA interfaces which are used to carry out
    the deployment of component-based applications. These interfaces depend
    on the in-memory IDL data structures that are built by the XML
    handlers. The following lists the interfaces defined by the
    specification and the level of support for each interface in DAnCE:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><code>RepositoryManager</code></b> &mdash; Only the
        <code>installPackage()</code> and <code>findPackageByName()</code>
        operations of this interface are implemented.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>TargetManager</code></b> &mdash; This interface has not
        been implemented at all. Implementation of this interface is a
        planned activity for the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>ExecutionManager</code></b> &mdash; All operations defined
        in this interface are implemented.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>DomainApplicationManager, DomainApplication</code></b>
        &mdash; All operations except <code>getApplications()</code>
        operation of DomainApplicationManager are implemented.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>NodeManager, NodeApplicationManager,
        NodeApplication</code></b> &mdash; All operations defined in these
        interfaces are implemented.
      </li>
    </ul>
