    <br/>Release Notes
    </h3>

    <b>D</b>eployment <b>An</b>d <b>C</b>onfiguration <b>E</b>ngine
    <b>(DAnCE)</b> is an implementation of the run-time infrastructure
    as defined by the recently adopted OMG <a
    href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2003-07-02">Deployment
    &amp; Configuration (D&amp;C)</a> specification, which deals with
    the configuration and deployment of component-based
    applications. Currently DAnCE only supports the deployment &amp;
    configuration of CORBA Component Model (CCM)-based applications,
    though we are interested in generalizing it for other component
    models in future work. DAnCE uses XML descriptors to drive the
    deployment it performs. One way to generate these descriptors is using the
    <b>Co</b>mponent <b>S</b>ynthesis using
    <b>M</b>odel-<b>I</b>ntegrated <b>C</b>omputing (<a
    href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/cosmic">CoSMIC</a>)
    tool-suite.  DAnCE currently uses <b>C</b>omponent <b>I</b>ntegrated
    <b>A</b>CE <b>O</b>RB (<a
    href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO">CIAO</a>) is used as the
    underlying CCM implementation in the current release, though again
    we are interested in generalizing it for other CCM implementations
    in future work. <P>

    <h3>D&amp;C XML Schema Handling</h3>

    <p> The XML handlers shipped with DAnCE are capable of handling
    almost all elements that are defined in the D&amp;C schema.  In
    this context, handling refers to reading the XML tags and
    converting them to the equivalent in-memory IDL-based data
    structures defined by the specifications. Some D&amp;C elements are
    not handled, however, including:
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:Any</code></b> &mdash; This is a complex
        element that is composed of many sub-elements. Currently, DAnCE only
        parses a subset of the sub-elements of <code>Deployment:Any</code>.
        Specifically, DAnCE supports all the basic data types defined as part
        of <code>Deployment:Any</code>, and doesn't understand any complex types.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>xmi:Extension</code></b> &mdash; This element 
        allows the augmention of the standard D&amp;C schema with user-defined
        elements. Currently DAnCE doesn't support user-defined extensions to
        the schema.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:Requirement</code></b> &mdash; This element is
        allows the description of requirements of component-based
        applications. Since handling this description requires interaction with the
        <code>TargetManager</code> interface (which is not yet
        supported), support for <code>Deployment:Requirement</code> is not present.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:ComponentPropertyDescription</code></b> &mdash;
        This element is used to specify default values for attributes of
        component. DAnCE doesn't support setting the values for attributes
        of components using this tag.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:ComponentExternalPortEndpoint,
        Deployment:ExternalReferenceEndpoint</code></b> &mdash; These
        elements are used to specify connections between ports of components
        in one assembly with ports of components in a different assembly,
        or connections between component ports and external connection
        endpoints. These features are needed to support assemblies of
        components. DAnCE doesn't support yet hierarchical assemblies, i.e.,
        creation of assemblies which can themselves contain sub-assemblies.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>Deployment:PlanPropertyMapping</code></b> &mdash; This
        element is used to delegate property mapping between a component's
        external properties to properties of subcomponents that actually
        implement the behavior of the larger component. Since DAnCE
        doesn't support hierarchical assemblies, this tag is not yet supported.<P>
      </li>
    </ul>
    We plan to support these features in future versions of DAnCE.
    </p>

    <h3>D&amp;C Management Interfaces</h3> <p> The D&amp;C specification
    defines a set of standard CORBA interfaces that are used to perform
    the deployment of component-based applications. These interfaces depend
    on the in-memory IDL data structures that are built by DAnCE's XML
    handlers.  Below we outline the list of interfaces defined by the
    specification and the level of support for each interface in DAnCE:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><code>RepositoryManager</code></b> &mdash; Only the
        <code>installPackage()</code> and <code>findPackageByName()</code>
        operations of this interface are implemented.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>TargetManager</code></b> &mdash; This interface has not
        been implemented at all. Implementation of this interface is 
        planned for the future.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>ExecutionManager</code></b> &mdash; All operations defined
        in this interface are implemented.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>DomainApplicationManager, DomainApplication</code></b>
        &mdash; All operations except <code>getApplications()</code>
        operation of DomainApplicationManager are implemented.<P>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>NodeManager, NodeApplicationManager,
        NodeApplication</code></b> &mdash; All operations defined in these
        interfaces are implemented.<P>
      </li>
    </ul>
    We plan to finish implementing the unsupported features in future versions of DAnCE.
