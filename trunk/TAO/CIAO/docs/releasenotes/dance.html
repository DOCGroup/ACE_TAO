<h1>Information for the Status of DAnCE</h1>

The purpose of this page is to illustrate what features in the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2003-07-02">OMG's DnC Spec</a>
are implemented/supported and what are not.

<h3>Things we have supported and things we have NOT supported yet:</h3>
<ol>
  <li class="style3">XML Handler </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> XML handlers are capable of parsing all elements
    that are defined in the XML schema. To be more precise, given a XML 
    descriptor confirming to the XML schema specified by the D&amp;C 
    specification, DAnCE XML handlers can parse all of those elements and 
    store the information in the IDL data structure also specified by the 
    D&amp;C specification.  </li> 
	  <p>
  <li>The only restriction is in the elements of the type <CODE>Deployment::Property</CODE>. These elements are complex types and can have sub 
    elements. The corresponding IDL data structure, which will capture the 
    values stored in the XML descriptors, are of the type &quot;Any&quot;. DAnCE XML 
    handlers, right now, have the capability to store only the basic data 
  types in these &quot;Any&quot;s.</li>
  <p>

  <li> DAnCE run-time 
    currently reads the information stored in the &quot;DeploymentPlan&quot; data 
    structure to perform the deployment of components. This capability is 
    currently restricted to reading only the following tags (See the descriptors contained in $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/tests/Config_Handlers/HUDisplay directory for details):
    <p>(1) <CODE>MonolithicDeploymentDescription</CODE>: Specifies the monolithic 
      implementation description of a component (interface), which is part of 
    an assembly, which in turn is part of a package.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User cannot specify the deployRequirement for this monolith. This 
              attribute specifies the target or collocation requirements that this 
        implementation could have. Presently, DAnCE doesn't handle this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>User cannot specify any Property (execParameter) for the monolith. 
        This attribute specifies the run-time attributes of this component. 
        Currently, DAnCE run-time doesn't handle the attributes for the components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(2) <CODE>ArtifactDeploymentDescription</CODE>: Specifies the artifacts used by the 
      monolithic implementation of a component(interface). Common examples are 
  entryPoints of a component and common libraries like ACE+TAO+CIAO 
  which are used by the components.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User cannot specify the deployRequirement, deployedResource and 
        execParameter for this artifact presently. To be precise, an user cannot specify 
        the target resource on which this artifact will run, cannot specify the 
        target resources on which this artifact will depend on and cannot 
        specify the run-time attributes this artifact will depend on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(3) <CODE>InstanceDeploymentDescription</CODE>: Specifies which instance of a 
      component runs on which node, which is defined in the DomainDescriptor.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DAnCE presently has the capability only to specify the instance 
        name and the node on which the instance will run.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(4) <CODE>PlanConnectionDescription</CODE>: Specifies the connection between the 
      components, which are part of the application.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DAnCE currently supports connections between 
        internalEndpoints only. ComponentExternalPortEndpoint and 
        ExternalReferenceEndpoints are not supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(5) <CODE>PlanPropertyMapping</CODE>: Maps the application's to-be-exposed properties 
      onto the properties of the components, part of the application.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DAnCE does not support this.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(6) <CODE>ImplementationDependencies</CODE>: Implementations of certain components 
      need to be run on the target environments, before the application 
      deployment, specified by this deployment plan, can be made.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DAnCE does not support this.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(7) <CODE>Property</CODE>: DeploymentPlan specific properties.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DAnCE does not support this.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(8) All the &quot;elements&quot; defined in the XML schema can have attributes. 
      However, our XML handlers can handle the following attributes only: 
      <CODE>xmi:idref</CODE> and <CODE>xmi:id</CODE>. We also don't support the <CODE>xmi:Extension</CODE> elements.</p>
  </li> 
  
</ul>

<ol start="2">
  <li class="style3">
    <p>Deployment Tools and Interfaces </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> RepositoryManager interface: Only &quot;installPackage&quot; and &quot;findPackageByName&quot; 
  operations are implemented. This interface is implemented as an executable. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>TargetManager interface: Has not been implemented yet. Implementation of this feature
is a work in progress. </li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li> ExecutionManager is implemented completely as an executable.
    <p>
        
  </li>
  <li>DomainApplicationManager and DomainApplication interfaces are combined together and is called &quot;DomainApplicationManager&quot;. As a result, all the methods, except getApplications (),  in the 
  DomainApplicationManager are implemented. Currently, the DomainApplicationManager is implemented as a library and used by ExecutionManager executable. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> NodeManager is implemented completely as an executable. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> NodeApplicationManager is implemented completely as a library and used by NodeManager executable. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>NodeApplication is implemented completely as an executable. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Executor <em>Actor</em> defined in the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2003-07-02">OMG's DnC Spec</a> is implemented as part of the RepositoryManager executable.<br>
  </li>
