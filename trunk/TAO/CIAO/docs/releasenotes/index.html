  <li><h3>Latest News</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>
         Mon Jun 28 2004 - The first cut of the new <strong>DnC</strong> specificication
         implementation is finished. The first cut includes two parts:
	 <ul>
         <li>
	    A modeling tool chain , <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CoSMIC/">
	    CoSMIC</a>, which is capable of describing the Assembly/Component
	    using <a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/default.html">
	    GME</a> as the development bed.
	    The artifacts generated from the CoSMIC are a set of XML descriptors.
         <li>
	    A run-time infrastructure that performs the actual deployment and
	    configuration, with a superset of the capabilities described in OMG
	    DnC specification with CIAO extension. The implementation source code
	    could be fount in <a href="../../DAnCE"> this directory </a>.<p><p>

	    In the new DnC run-time framework we have migrated all the
	    functionalities presented in the old CIAO runtime except the
	    Real-Time configuration and Static Configuration, which are
	    developed by Washington University in St. Louis. Currently,
	    the two CIAO runtime co-exist in our source and the component
	    implementation could be used with both framework without much
	    change. (For the change that one has to go through please
	    read <a href="./switch.html">this</a>.)<p>
	  <li>
	    Here is a set of updates in the CIDL Compiler.<p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Fixed bugs in generation of inherited: home operations,
		    attribute operations, port operations, home factory
		    operations, supported operationsa.<p>

		 <li>Added support for multiplex uses ports.<p>

		 <li>Added automatic registration of value factories for
		     event consumers.<p>

		 <li>Added support for emits-related navigation.<p>

		 <li>Fixed bug with multiple facets in a build that provide
		     the same interface.<p>

		 <li>Implemented get_all_facets() and get_all_consumers()
		     navigation methods.
	     </ul>
	  </ul>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <ul>
        <li>Sun Aug 24 2003 - The first phase of RT support extension
            is complete.  The RT extension enables developers to
            specify RT policy on a per component installation basis
            (per home, and the component created form the home).  The
            extension includes the following major features:
            <ul>
              <li>A real-time ComponentServer:  A real-time
                  ComponentServer is capable of hosting real-time
                  Container for components in real-time applications.
                  To use the real-time ComponentServer, simply tell
                  CIAO_Daemon to use the RTComponentServer via the
                  '-n' flag.

              <li>RT extension for assembly descriptors (defined in
                  .cad files) to specify component installations to RT
                  policy sets defined in CIAO's real-time descriptors
                  (defined in CIAO's .rtd files.)  DTD definitions for
                  .rtd files can be found in <a
                  href="../XML/ciao_rt_cad_ext.dtd">this file</a>.  An
                  example .cad file that uses the RT extension and an
                  example .rtd file that provides RT policy
                  definitions can be found at:
                  <pre><code>
     $(CIAO_ROOT)/examples/OEP/Display/descriptors/HUDisplay-rtcad.cad
     $(CIAO_ROOT)/examples/OEP/Display/descriptors/test.rtd
                  </code></pre>
            </ul>

            More documentation and comprehensive
            examples/tests/benchmark results for CIAO's RT extension
            will be added shortly.
            <p>

        <li>Thu Jul 31 2003 - Arvind and Diego are starting to work on
            benchmarking and comparing the performance of CIAO and
            TAO.  These performance test programs are available in
            <a href="../../performance-tests/Benchmark/">the repository
            </a><p>

        <li>Thu Jul 24 2003 - Bala and George are starting to work on a container
            mediated event delivering support.  This will allow developers
            to specify the event deliverying strategy and the degree
            of QoS.  The fist task is to integrate TAO's event channel
            into the container framework.<p>

        <li>Tue Jun  3 2003 - The first Alpha release of CIAO is now
            available with ACE/TAO beta kit.<p>

        <li>Mon Jun  2 2003 - We now have a CIDL compiler.  Check
            out its <a href="../../CIDLC/README">README</a> file for more
            information.  Examples are also moved to <a
            href="../../examples/OEP/">here</a> to use the new CIDL
            compiler to generate servant glue code.<p>

        <li>Thu Apr 16 2003 - The HUDisplay example now also works on
            Linux platforms and allows you to remotely setup an
            application. <p>

        <li>Sat Apr  5 2003 - Added the support for connection
            establishment and finished the multiple-component
            <a href="../../examples/OEP/Display/"> HUDisplay
            example</a>.  Check out the <a
            href="../../examples/OEP/Display/descriptors/NOTE.txt">
            note </a> to see how to play with it.  You need to
            have <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a> library
            available if you want to play with the GUI based
            component.  If you don't, no worries.  You can still play
            with the non-GUI configurations.<p>

        <li>Thu Apr  3 2003 - Added the XML documents handlers for
            componentassembly.  They build the assembly specification
            that the assembly mechanisms use to compose an
            application.  As with handlers for parsing softpkg
            documents, these handlers do not have robust error
            handling capability as they assume a validator in ACEXML
            parser handles the validity of documents already (which
            isn't the case for the time being.)<p>

        <li>Fri Mar 21 2003 - Finished the component implementations
            for the multi-component example.  Next up, assembling
            mechanism. <p>

        <li>Thu Mar 6 2003 - The HelloWorld now uses the new command
            Daemon control options to read in the component softpkg
            descriptor, spawn a ComponentServer, and instantiate the
            component.  See the <code>
            <a href="../../examples/Hello/run_test.pl">
            run_test.pl</a></code> for more details on how this can be
            done. <p>

        <li>Sun Feb 16 2003 - A new implementation for the per-host
            daemon process is now availabe under <code>
            $(CIAO_ROOT)/tools/Daemon/</code>.  This application
            includes both <code> ComponentInstallation</code> and
            <code>ServerActivator</code> interfaces.  It also comes
            with a command line utility program to interact with the
            daemon process.  Please see its <a
            href="../../tools/Daemon/README">README</a> file for more
            information.<p>

            Implementation for <code>ComponentInstallation</code>
            interface uses ACE_Configuration to maintain persistency
            of component intallation data. <p>

        <li>Fri Feb 14 2003 - We now have most of the assembly and
            deployment framewok processes available.  Next up,
            implementing the XML
            handlers that actually parses component assemblies and
            assembles an application.<p>

        <li>Sun Feb  9 2003 - Started implementing the Deployment and
            Assembly framework a week ago.  So far, the object
            management mechanisms for AssemblyFactory and Assembly is
            done, but I still need to fill in the meat where we build an
            Assembly by parsing the Assembly descriptor.  I'm going to
            move on to finish the implementations for the rest of the
            Deployment and Assembly interfaces in the next few days.<p>

            <b>It looks like we will have to go straight to our
            planned 0.2 release as our first publically available
            CIAO. </b><p>

        <li>Mon Jan 13 2003 - Finished the first round effort to
            create a meta-code to describe how the CIDL compiler
            should generated the container specific glue code.  These
            templates are available <a href="../templates/">here</a>.
            These templates can also be used to help handcrafting the
            examples I'm working on.<p>

        <li>Mon Jan 6 2003 - Both Jeff and Boris are working on the
            CIDL compiler implementation.<p>

        <li>Tue Dec 24 2002 - Started working a multi-component
            handcrafted example in <a
            href="../../examples/OEP/Display/">examples/OEP/Display/</a><p>

        <li>Sat Dec 21 2002 - Added *nix Makefiles, MPC specifications
            and created MPC templates for CIAO clients, component
            implementations, and server tools.<p>

        <li>Wed Dec 18 2002 - A perl script fits beautifully with the
            HelloWorld example.<p>

        <li>Dec 17 2002 - A NameService based HomeFinder
            implementation -- CIAO::HomeRegistrar -- is now
            available.  The simple component server in CIAO now use
            the support the HomeFinder interface so we can install as
            many components in the component server as possible.<p>

        <li>Dec 15 2002 - Generic component server that can host
            multiple components with a proprietary config file.  More
            information can be found <a
            href="../../tools/Simple_Component_Server/README"> here </a>
            Next up, a trivial HomeFinder interface that can
            simply forward requests to a Naming Service.<p>

        <li>Dec 11 2002 - The server implementation in the HelloWorld
            example is now a generic one-component server.  It can be
            modified easily to host any *one* component easily.<p>

        <li>Dec 10 2002 - <a href="com-impl.html">This document</a>
            captures how to "handcraft" a component and how this all
            will be automated in the future.<p>

        <li>Nov 22 2002 - Completed the first handcrafted example
            <a href="../../examples/Hello/README">HelloWorld</a>
            component implementation.  CIAO now also include a
            minimally functioning session container implementation.<p>

  <th> Modules </th>
  <th> Status </th>

  <tr>
    <td>CCM Core</td>
    <td>We are currently working on a prototype that enables remote
        component installation using the CCM
        <code>ComponentInstallation</code> interface, a component
        server implementation.  Since we
        still don't have a CIDL implementation, we will also write up
        an example to show how the code should be generated in both
        CCIDL compiler and provide example component
        implementations.

        There exists 3 libraries in CCM Core.
        <ol>
          <li><b>CIAO_Client</b>: contains the client side stubs for
              CCMObject.  All client programs that use CCMObject must
              link to this library.
          <li><b>CIAO_Container</b>: contains the interface
              definitions and CIAO's container implementation.  All
              component implementations must link to this library.
          <li><b>CIAO_Server</b>: contains the stubs to access
              deployment framework.  We'll need to use this to
              implement the deployment mechanism.
        </ol>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>TAO_IDL</td>
    <td>TAO_IDL has been extended to handle and generate all the
        component related keywords but <code>import</code>.  We are
        currently using the generated mapping, in combination to
        manually simulation of CIDL generated code to implement CCM
        component.
        TAO_IDL Check out <a
        href="http://cvs.doc.wustl.edu/ace-latest.cgi/ACE_wrappers/TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html#idl"> TAO IDL compiler</a> for more details.

  <tr>
    <td>CIDL (Component Implementation Defintion Language) Compiler</td>
    <td>
		An implementation that supports a subset of CIDL appropriate for
		DRE systems has been implemented.
        We do not have immediate plans to integrate
        Persistence State Service into the CIAO CIDL compiler. At present
        we support only a simple construct like the following:
<pre>
        module component_composite_name {
          composition service component_home_executor {
            implements component_home;
            manages component_executor;
          };
        };
</pre>
        The compiler generates operation implementations
        inherited from following interfaces:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Navigation</code>
          <li><code>Receptacle</code>
          <li><code>Event</code>
          <li><code>CCMObject</code>
          <li>Component specific context
          <li>Executor
        </ul>

  </tr>
</table><p>

<li><b>TAO Modules required by CIAO:</b>  We currently don't have a
    target set up in TAO's make system to build CIAO required module
    only, so you need to do this yourself.  (BTW, we only support the
    use of dynamic linked libraries, at least for now.) Here is a list
    of necessary TAO modules in order of dependencies:

    <ol>
      <li>TAO Main library.
      <li>PortableServer
      <li>orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Security
      <li>IFR_Client

<h2>Project Outlook</h2>
This to-do list is currently arranged in chronological order,
<i>i.e.</i>, we group features that are expected to be available in
certain release together.  All interfaces and types are under
<CODE>Components</code> module namespace if not specified explicitly.

<ul>
  <li><b>CIAO 0.1 alpha release</b> - (post TAO 1.3, Dec. 2002)
      <UL>
        <li>Default implementation of <code>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigations
              <li>Receptacles
              <li>Events

            </code>
            interfaces and their supporting data types that
            <code>CCMObject</code> interface requires.  These
            interfaces are defined in <code>
            <a href="../../ciao/CIAO_Base.idl">CCM_Base.idl</a></code>
            and <code><a
            href="../../ciao/CIAO_Event.idl">CCM_Event.idl</a></code>.
        <li>Default implementation of <code>
            <ul>
              <li>CCMObject
              <li>CCMHome
              <li>KeylessCCMHome
            </ul>
            </code> and their supporting data types as defined in part
            of the <code><a href="../../ciao/CCM_Component.idl">
            CIAO_Component.idl </a></code>.
        <li>Partial support for basic container/callback interfaces: <code>
            <ul>
              <li>CCMContext, SessionContext
              <li>EnterpriseComponent, SessionComponent
            </ul>
            </code>
        <li>Extension to CORBA Core
            <ul>
              <li><code>CORBA::LocalObject</code> interface has been
                  added a long time ago.
              <li><code>get_component()</code> method in
                  <code>CORBA::{Object|LocalObject}</code>
                  interfaces.
            </ul>
        <li><code>HomeExecutorBase</code> interface
        <li>Support (hand crafted) monolithic executor implementation
        <li>Extension to IDL compiler and Typecode factory.  IDL
            compiler shall recognize all CCM keyword extensions but not
            necessarily generate code for these added keywords.
        <li>Adaptive configuration of Notification Service/Event Channels
        <li>Partial implementation of <code>Deployment</code> module.
            <!-- support some descriptors -->
      </UL>
      AT this stage, we only implement "enough" CCM defined interface
      capability to allow manual implementation of components and a
      simple framework that offer some remote installation/composition
      capability.  This will help design how CCIDL generated code
      should look like.
