This example is the Qt-based GUI implementation of NavDisplay component.

It is NOT necessary to compile ACE/TAO/CIAO with Qt support,
i.e. ACE_HAS_QT since this example does not relyes on Qt Reactor and
communicates with GUI part using QApplication::postMessage() and
simple Command Pattern based framework.  But be sure that QTDIR
environment variable is pointed to your Qt installation directory.

If you need to build this component, make sure you have the necessary
Qt libraries/tools installed, and define

qt = 1

in $(ACE_ROOT)/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features before
creating the workspace/project for this example.
