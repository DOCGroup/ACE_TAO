/**

@page BasicSP README File

      The most basic of the Boeing scenarios that form part of the
OEP. This is done to illustrate how the OEP can be implemented using
CIAO. 

      This example does not yet use MPC to generate MSVC 
projects/workspaces/solutions or makefiles - we are still
working on getting the execution of the CIDL compiler
integrated into MPC. The CIDL compiler execution has
been added to MSVC projects, which for now are checked
into the CVS repository.
