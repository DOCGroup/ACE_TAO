The C++ source files in this directory are compiled into the
code generators and driver for the CIAO CIDL compiler.

The CIDL compiler's front end is built from files in the
$CIAO_ROOT/CCF directory.

The CIAO CIDL compiler requires two libraries:

* the Boost library, which may be downloaded from:

  http://www.boost.org

* the Utility library, which can be downloaded from:

  ftp://ftp.kolpackov.net/pub/Utility/Utility-1.2.1.tar.bz2


Once compiled and installed, you have to define two environment
variables for them:

BOOST_ROOT
UTILITY_ROOT

indicating where these libraries have been installed.

Binary executables for the CIDL compiler are available at

http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO/CIDL.html

Versions are available at the above site for Linux and Windows.

Naming Convention.

The CIAO's CIDL compiler directory was called CIDLC which stands for
CIDL Compiler (like CC stands for C Compiler, etc). This directory
wasn't called CCIDLC (CIAO's CIDL Compiler) or CIAO_CIDLC because
that would incure needless tautology since the directory structure
(.../CIAO/tools/CIDLC) already implies that it's CIAO's CIDC.

Now about CIDLC executable name. The logical name of the excutable
implied by directory name (CIDLC) would be cidlc (like cc for
C Compiler). However there was a concern originally expressed by
Nanbor that cidlc is too generic name and when installed for
example as /usr/bin/cidlc would loose it's CIAO's context.

At the same time recommended by FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)
package installation location is /opt/<package>. Thus if installation
directory would be for instance /opt/CIAO then naming CIDLC executable
ciao_cidlc would create needless tautology (i.e./opt/CIAO/bin/ciao_cidlc).
Though in my opinion there is nothing bad in having generic name like
cidlc (user always can execute cidlc --version) and as suggested by FHS
installations like /usr/bin/ciao_cidl are non-conformant the decision was
made to call CIAO's CIDLC execuatable ciao_cidlc.
