The C++ source files in this directory are compiled into the 
code generators and driver for the CIAO CIDL compiler.

The CIDL compiler's front end is built from files in the
$CIAO_ROOT/CCF directory.

The CIAO CIDL compiler uses the Boost library, which may be
downloaded from:

http://www.boost.org

See documentation files in CIAO_ROOT/CCF/External/Utility/Documentation 
for more information on installation, supported platforms, design, etc.

Binary executables for the CIDL compiler are available at

http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO/CIDL.html

Versions are available at the above site for Linux and Windows.

Naming Convention.

The CIAO's CIDL compiler directory was called CIDLC which stands for
CIDL Compiler (like CC stands for C Compiler, etc). This directory
wasn't called CCIDLC (CIAO's CIDL Compiler) or CIAO_CIDLC because 
that would incure needless tautology since the directory structure 
(.../CIAO/tools/CIDLC) already implies that it's CIAO's CIDC.

Now about CIDLC executable name. The logical name of the excutable 
implied by directory name (CIDLC) would be cidlc (like cc for 
C Compiler). However there was a concern originally expressed by
Nanbor that cidlc is too generic name and when installed for 
example as /usr/bin/cidlc would loose it's CIAO's context.

At the same time recommended by FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) 
package installation location is /opt/<package>. Thus if installation 
directory would be for instance /opt/CIAO then naming CIDLC executable 
ciao_cidlc would create needless tautology (i.e./opt/CIAO/bin/ciao_cidlc).
Though in my opinion there is nothing bad in having generic name like 
cidlc (user always can execute cidlc --version) and as suggested by FHS 
installations like /usr/bin/ciao_cidl are non-conformant the decision was
made to call CIAO's CIDLC execuatable ciao_cidlc.
