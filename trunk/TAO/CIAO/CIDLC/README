The C++ source files in this directory are compiled into the
code generators and driver for the CIAO CIDL compiler. CORBA 
Compiler Framework (CCF) provides the front-end for the compiler.

Pre-built binary executables of CIDL compiler are available at

http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~boris/cidlc

To build CIDL compiler you will need to compile CCF libraries
first. Instructions for doing this can be found at

$(CIAO_ROOT)/CCF/Documentation/Build.html

After you have CCF libraries compiled you can build CIDL compiler
with makefiles on UNIX

$ make -f Makefile.alt

or by using VC 7.1 project on Windows.
