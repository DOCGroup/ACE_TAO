The C++ source files in this directory are compiled into the
code generators and driver for the CIAO CIDL compiler.

The CIDL compiler's front end is built from files in the
$CIAO_ROOT/CCF directory.

The CIAO CIDL compiler requires two libraries:

* the Boost library, which may be downloaded from:

  http://www.boost.org

* the Utility library, which can be downloaded from:

  ftp://ftp.kolpackov.net/pub/Utility/Utility-1.2.1.tar.bz2


Once compiled and installed, you have to define two environment
variables for them:

BOOST_ROOT
UTILITY_ROOT

indicating where these libraries have been installed.

Binary executables for the CIDL compiler are available at

http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO/CIDL.html

Versions are available at the above site for Linux and Windows.
