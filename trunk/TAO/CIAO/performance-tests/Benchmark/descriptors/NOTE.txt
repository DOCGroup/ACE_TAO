This directory contains various XML descriptors and configuration
files required to compose the HUDisplay application in a variety of
different ways.  Let's go over a few important files first:

test.dat:
---------

  This file describes the deployment daemons CIAO's Assembly_Manager
  will contact to instantiate ComponentServer's, home's, and component
  instances.  Each line specify the name of a installation
  "destination" (I used this to specify <processcollocation>
  destination in various *.cad files) and the corresponding IOR for
  the CIAO_Daemon.  The first entry is the "default" destination the
  deployment framework will use.

  For example, test.dat now contains:

      Default corbaloc:iiop:localhost:10000/ServerActivator
      Remote  corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12000/ServerActivator

  You can copy and modify the copy to deploy the components in various
  different locations to let the application truely "distributed".
  For example, changing the remote ServerActivator to:
    corbaloc:iiop:deuce.doc.wustl.edu:13000/ServerActivator

  Remember to start up the Assembly_Manager in Step 2 using the
  revised "test.dat" you created, and start up the CIAO_Daemon's in
  Step 1 according to the specification.

*.cad:
------

  These files specify how an application should be composed.  The
  specification includes, where to install a component, what
  implementation to use, and how to connect components together.
  Currently, we have:

  Benchmark.cad: Plain vanilla assembly descriptor.  This file install
                 all components using the "Default" (the first daemon)
                 in 'test.dat.  You can see the application output
                 from the default daemon shell.

There are automated perl scripts that can run the tests to generate the
required results. These are located in the individual component directorires
RoundTrip and RoundTripClient. The descriptors directory has the required
.cad files that specify the component configuration used in the various
experiments.
