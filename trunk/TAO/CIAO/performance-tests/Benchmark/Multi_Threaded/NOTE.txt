PRE Condition:
=============
This test assumes that there is an appropriate svc.conf file present in 
$CIAO_ROOOT/tools/ComponentServer.

Similarly, the client also requires the svc.conf file that enables
multi-threading. This file is present in this directory.

The svc.conf file required for this experiment can be obtained from 
$TAO_ROOT/performance-tests/Latency/Thread_Pool
