   referred to as "DOC software") are copyrighted by [5]Douglas C.
   Schmidt and his [6]research group at [7]Washington University,
   [8]University of California, Irvine, and [9]Vanderbilt University,
   Copyright (c) 1993-2004, all rights reserved. Since DOC software is
   [10]open-source, free software, you are free to use, modify, copy, and
   distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software source code
   and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and
   distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however,
   include this copyright statement along with code built using DOC
   software.
   
   You can use DOC software in proprietary software and are under no
   obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using
   DOC software. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the DOC
   software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship
   of the DOC software code, that will prevent DOC software from being
   distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't
   inform anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though
   we encourage you to let [11]us know so we can promote your project in
   the [12]DOC software success stories..

   including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a
   particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of
   dealing, usage or trade practice. Moreover, DOC software is provided
   with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington
   University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or
   students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or
   enhancement. A [13]number of companies around the world provide
   commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software is
   Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant.
   
   Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their
   employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to the
   infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
   software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington
   University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or
   students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special,
   indirect and consequential damages.
   
   The [14]ACE, [15]TAO, [16]CIAO, and [17]CoSMIC web sites are

   Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the [20]Center for Distributed Object
   Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development of
   open-source software as part of the [21]open-source software
   community. By submitting comments, suggestions, code, code snippets,
