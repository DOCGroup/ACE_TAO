* Assembly_Manager

  Assembly_Manager is the daemon process for the assembly framework.
  It contains the knowledge of "deployment topology".

  Usage:

     Assembly_Manager -c <deployment configuration file> -o <ior_output_file>

  The deployment configuration file contain the mapping from logical
  host name to actual target name, in corbaloc IOR format.


* Assembly_Deployer

  Assembly_Deployer is the controlling program for Assembly_Manager.
  You can use Assembly_Deployer to deploy and start up an application
  assembly or to tear down a running application assembly.

  Usage:

  To deploy an assembly:

    Assembly_Deployer -k <ior to Assembly_Manager> \
                      -a <assembly descriptor filename> \
                      -t <benchmark assembly deployment time> \
                      -o <filename to write assembly id to>

  To teardown an assembly:

    Assembly_Deployer -k <ior to Assembly_Manager> \
                      [-d <filename containing assembly id>]
                      [-x]

                      -x can be used optionally to shutdown the manager.
