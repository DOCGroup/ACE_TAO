@page ORB_shutdown Test README File

	The simplest possible test for TAO's shutdown procedure. This
test is basically a regression for BUG 1265. Please see BUG 1265 in

    http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1265

for details.

        This test basically calls shutdown and during the destruction
of the servant calls shutdown again. This test shold not hang if BUG
1265 is fixed.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
