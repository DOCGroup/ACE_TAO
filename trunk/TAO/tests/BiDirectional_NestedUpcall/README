This test is similar to the $TAO_ROOT/tests/BiDirectional test. The
only difference is that, this test uses the select_mt reactor, which
helps the server to make calls to client during the upcall.  Please
see the README file in $TAO_ROOT/tests/BiDirectional to see why this
would fail with a TP reactor. Also see bug id #575 in bugzilla to
understand more about the TP reactors behavior.
