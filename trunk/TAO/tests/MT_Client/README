Description:

	This is a simple test for multi-threaded clients; it just
creates a simple server process and runs a client with multiple thread
sharing the same object reference.

Expected output:
	The server prints out the IOR of the object it serves. The
client shouldn't print out anything, it returns 0 on success.

How to run:
	You can use the run_test.pl script to run it or:

$ server -o test.ior
$ client -k file://test.ior -n 4 -i 1000
