@page ClientPortSpan Test README File

  Based on the Hello test client & server. Server pauses before returning to
  give all clients a chance to start.

  Test demonstrates that clients can be constrained to opening IIOP connections
  only on specific local side ports, and will fail if no ports in the range are
  available.

  To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
