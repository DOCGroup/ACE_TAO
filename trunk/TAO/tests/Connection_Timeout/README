@page Connection_Timeout Test README File

	The simplest possible test for the proprietary
Connection_Timeouts. This test sets the connection timeouts through a
policy. The client tries to connect to an non-existent server. The
timeout for the connection is controlled by the value supplied by that
policy.

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
