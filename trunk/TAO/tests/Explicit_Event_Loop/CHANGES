Changelog for chapter 3 example in "Advanced CORBA Programming 
with C++" by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski, Copyright 1999, 
Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA.  The following changes have been made
to the book's source code to make the example work with TAO and 
with various platforms and compilers.

______________________________________________________________________________
ESSENTIAL CHANGES:
  1. changed filenames .cc to .cpp and .hh h, and modified #includes in 
     client.cpp server.cpp and server.h appropriately.

  2. a) changed #include "time.h"  to  #include "timeC.h" in client.cpp

     b) Moved standard #includes below local #includes, and commented-out 
        unnecessary #includes to avoid warnings and errors (g++)
          -client.cpp now reads:
              #include "timeC.h"
              #include <iomanip.h>
              // #include <iostream.h>
          -server.cpp now reads:
              #include "server.h"
              // #include <time.h>
              // #include <iostream.h>

______________________________________________________________________________
ADDITIONAL CHANGES:
  3. added .in() to _var type parameters 
       -3 times in client.cpp for calls to is_nil() and _narrow()
       -3 times in main() in server.cpp for calls to _narrow(), 
        object_to_string, and <<

CHANGES MADE EXCLUSIVLY FOR TESTING PURPOSES

  4. to allow the test to be built without exceptions=1, all try/catch 
     code has been replaced with ACE_TRY macros, and the CORBA Environment 
     variable has been added to the parameters of get_gmt().
 
  5. In server.cpp, the call to orb->run() has been replaced with an explicit
     event utilizing orb->work_pending() and orb->perform_work().
