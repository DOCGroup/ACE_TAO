CollocationStrategy TAO_COLLOCATION_BEST:

This tests  performs a series of checks on CollocationStrategy 'best'  (TAO_COLLOCATION_BEST) support in TAO.

With CollocationStrategy 'best'  the best possible collocation strategy is tried to perform.
 If TAO_COLLOCATION_DIRECT is possible, this has to be used, else if TAO_COLLOCATION_THRU_POA
 is possible this has to be used, else use remote stub. 

The test Collocated_Best_Direct uses IDLflags -Sp, to disable Thru_poa collocation
  and -Gd, to enable Direct collocation.
Starting the test with -ORBCollocationStrategy 'best' ,
 the test should use TAO_COLLOCATION_DIRECT collocation.

The test Collocated_Best_ThruP uses default IDLflags,so Thru_poa collocation is enabled
and Direct collocation is default not enabled.
Starting the test with -ORBCollocationStrategy 'best', the test should use
TAO_COLLOCATION_THRU_POA collocation.

The test Collocated_Best_ThruP uses IDLflags -Sp, to disable Thru_poa collocation
and Direct collocation is default not enabled.
Starting the test with -ORBCollocationStrategy 'best', the test should use no collocation, but remote stubs.
