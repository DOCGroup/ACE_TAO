This directory houses a collection of tests which exercise TAO support
for features defined in the RT-CORBA specification. Tests which exercise
TAO-specific RT features can be found in $TAO_ROOT/performance-tests/RTCorba.
OMG Real-time CORBA specification is available at:
http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/99-05-03 (or check the OMG website
for a more recent version).

More information on TAO's implementation of RT-CORBA 1.0 specification
is available at:
$TAO_ROOT/docs/rtcorba/index.html

Each individual subdirectory contains a README file with more
information on the corresponding test.  The list of tests so far
includes the following:

        . Banded_Connections

          Test for RTCORBA::PriorityBandedConnection policy.

        . Client_Propagated

          Test for RTCORBA::PriorityModel policy with
          RTCORBA::CLIENT_PROPAGATED value.

        . Client_Protocol

          Test for RTCORBA::ClientProtocol policy.

        . Collocation

          Test for collocation when using thread pools and lanes.

        . Destroy_Thread_Pool

          Test for creating and destroying thread pools (with and
          without lanes).

        . Explicit_Binding

          Test for <Object::_validate_connection>.

        . Linear_Priority

          Test for Linear Priority mapping.  Also combines and tests
          several RT policies in different ways.

        . MT_Client_Protocol_Priority

          Test for multi-threaded clients using the
          RTCORBA::ClientProtocol policy.

        . ORB_init

          Test for creation and destruction of multiple RT ORBs.

        . Persistent_IOR

          Test for -ORBEndpoint option. Also makes sure that user
          cannot use thread pools and persistence simultaneously.

        . Policies

          This program tests the construction of RTCORBA policies,
          both through the generic ORB::create_policy interface and
          the RTCORBA specific interfaces.

        . Policy_Combinations

          Test that combines and tests several RT policies in
          different ways.

        . Priority_Inversion_With_Bands

          This test check for priority inversion when using different
          RTCORBA configurations.

        . Private_Connection

          Test for RTCORBA::PrivateConnection policy.

        . RTMutex

          Test for RTCORBA::Mutex.

        . Server_Declared

          Test for RTCORBA::PriorityModel policy with
          RTCORBA::SERVER_DECLARED value.

        . Server_Protocol

          Test for RTCORBA::ServerProtocol policy.

        . Thread_Pool

          Tests the creation and use of thread pools.
