This directory houses a collection of tests which exercise TAO support
for features defined in the RT-CORBA specification.  OMG Real-time
CORBA specification is available at:
http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/99-05-03 (or check the OMG website
for a more recent version).  More information on TAO's implementation
of RT-CORBA 1.0 specification is available at:

http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/corba-research-realtime.html

and information on the status of TAO's RT-CORBA status is available at

$TAO_ROOT/docs/releasenotes/RTCorba.html

Each individual subdirectory contains a README file with more
information on the corresponding test.  The list of tests so far
includes the following:

        . Client_Propagated

          Tests PriorityModelPolicy with RTCORBA::CLIENT_PROPAGATED
          value.

        . Server_Declared

          Tests PriorityModelPolicy with RTCORBA::SERVER_DECLARED
          value.

        . Server_Protocol

          Tests various settings of RTCORBA::ServerProtocolPolicy.

        . Client_Protocol

          Tests various settings of RTCORBA::ClientProtocolPolicy.

        . Private_Connection

          Tests RTCORBA::PrivateConnectionPolicy support.

        . Banded_Connections

          Tests RTCORBA::PriorityBandedConnectionPolicy.

        . Explicit_Binding

          Tests <Object::_validate_connection>.

        . MT_Client_Protocol_Priority

          Multithreaded client test. Two client threads [with
          different priorities and different ClientProtocolPolicy
          Current-level overrides] concurrently making invocations on
          one object reference, which has a CLIENT_PROPAGATED priority
          model.
