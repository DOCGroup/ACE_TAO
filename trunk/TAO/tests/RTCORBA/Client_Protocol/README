This is a unit test for RTCORBA::ClientProtocolPolicy.

Description: 
---------
This test consists of five mini-tests, each exercising
ClientProtocolPolicy in a different configuration:

1. Invoke an operation on the object that had ClientProtocolPolicy set
   on the server side.  Make sure the protocol dictated by the policy is
   used for communication.

2. Set ORB-level ClientProtocolPolicy override on the client ORB, and
   invoke an operation on an object that had ClientProtocolPolicy set
   on the server side.  Should receive CORBA::INV_POLICY exception
   since the policy is set on both client and server sides.

3. Set ORB-level ClientProtocolPolicy override on the client ORB, and
   invoke an operation on an object that did *not* have
   ClientProtocolPolicy set on the server side.  Make sure the
   protocol dictated by the policy override is used for communication.

4. Set ClientProtocolPolicy override on the Current level in the
   client ORB, and invoke an operation on an object that did *not*
   have ClientProtocolPolicy set on the server.  The override value is
   a sequence of protocols none of which are available in the server
   ORB.  Should receive CORBA::INV_POLICY exception since none of the
   protocols specified in the policy are available for communication.

5. Set ClientProtocolPolicy override on the Current level in the
   client ORB, and invoke an operation on an object that did *not*
   have ClientProtocolPolicy set on the server.  The override value is
   a sequence of two protocols, in which the first protocol isn't
   available in the server ORB, and the second protocol is available
   in both client and server ORBs.  Make sure the second protocol
   specified in the override is used for communication.


Scenario:

The server creates two objects: one with ClientProtocolPolicy set and
the other one without the policy being set.  The value of the
ClientProtocolPolicy is a single protocol specified using server
command-line option (see Options section below).  The client obtains
two object references and uses them to run five tests decribed
above. Finally, the client invokes <shutdown> method on the server to
terminate the processes.

To run (on Unix):
-------
$./server [-s <ior_output_file1> -c <ior_output_file2> -p <profile_id>]
$./client [-s <ior1> -c <ior2> -p <profile_id>] -ORBdebuglevel 1


Options:
--------
         Server:

-s <ior_output_file1>   Default: test1.ior
                        Filename for output of IOR for the object that
                        had ClientProtocolPolicy set on the server.

-c <ior_output_file2>   Default: test2.ior
                        Filename for output of IOR for the object that
                        did not have ClientProtocolPolicy set on the
                        server. 

-p <profile_id>         Default: 0 (IIOP)
                        Protocol used as a ClientProtocolPolicy value
                        for one of the server's objects.

         Client:

-s <ior_output_file1>   Default: file://test1.ior
                        IOR for the object that had
                        ClientProtocolPolicy set on the server. 

-c <ior_output_file2>   Default: file://test2.ior
                        IOR for the object that did not have
                        ClientProtocolPolicy set on the server. 

-p <profile_id>         Default: 0 (IIOP)
                        Protocol used as a ClientProtocolPolicy value
                        on the client.

-ORBdebuglevel 1        Recommended ORB option for the client in order to see
                        which protocols are being used in each
                        mini-test for client-server communication.
                        


Expected output:
----------------
Test 1: invocation should succeed using the protocol specified with
        <-p> option to the server. 
Tests 2 and 4: should produce INV_POLICY exception.
Tests 3 and 5: invocation should succeed using the protocol specified
               with <-p> option to the client.

Below is the expected output from run_test.pl on a Unix platform. See
run_test.pl for command-line options used for client and server.
NOTE: expected output differs on windows due to uiop not being
available.
