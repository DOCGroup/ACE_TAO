This is a unit test for setting DiffServ Codepoint both in the
requests sent and the replies received. It also illustrates how a
Custom Network Priority Mapping can be plugged in.

Scenario:
--------

Testing the setting of dscp in the requests sent
-------------------------------------------------

Server creates a POA and registers a servant with it.  Client obtains
the object reference. It sets the desired corba and native
priority. Client then performs several invocations on the object
during which it sets and unsets diffserv codepoint at the ORB, THREAD
and OBJECT levels.

Testing the setting of dscp in the replies sent
-------------------------------------------------

Server creates a POA and enables network priority through the POA
policy. This ensures that all replies sent from the POA have the dscp
set. It registers a servant with this POA. Client obtains the object
reference. Client then performs several invocations on the object.

To run (on Unix):
-----------------

$ ./server -ORBdebuglevel 1 -p 20000
$ ./client -ORBdebuglevel 1 -n 10 -p 10000 -k file://simple_servant.ior
$ ./client -ORBdebuglevel 1 -n 10 -p 10000 -k file://diffserv_servant.ior

Both client executions set diffserv codepoints on outbound
packets. When the client invokes on the diffserv_servant, reply
packets also have diffserv codepoints set on them.

NOTE: The iterations have to be >=6 in order to test set/unset at the
ORB, THREAD and OBJECT levels.
