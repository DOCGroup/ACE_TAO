This is a unit test for RTCORBA::PrivateConnectionPolicy.

Description.  
-------- 
The server creates two servants, registers them with the Root POA,
prints out their IORs and waits for the requests from the client.  The
client obtains the IORs, makes several invocations on the objects,
then sets RTCORBA::PrivateConnectionPolicy on PolicyCurrent (i.e.,
thread-level) and makes a few more invocations on the objects.

The goal of the test is to check that new connections are established
only when expected, and that appropriate connection is used for each
invocation.  Since what we are trying to verify are the internal
workings of the ORB, we are relying on ORB debug messages to do it.

Client makes a total of 8 invocations (not counting the shutdown
request at the end).  A message containing invocation number, whether
the new connection is to be established, and, if not, which one should
be reused, is printed out before each invocation.  ORB debug messages
that follow allow us to verify whether things worked as expected.  See
Expected output section below for more information.

To run (on Unix):
-------
$./server [-o <ior_output_file1> -p <ior_output_file2>]
$./client [-o <ior1> -p <ior2>] -ORBdebuglevel 3


Options:
--------
        Server:

-o <ior_output_file1>      Default: test1.ior
                           Filename for output of the IOR of the first
                           testing object.

-p <ior_output_file2>      Default: test2.ior
                           Filename for output of the IOR of the
                           second testing object.

        Client:

-o <ior1>                  Default: file://test1.ior
                           IOR of the first test object.

-p <ior2>                  Default: file://test2.ior
                           IOR of the second test object.

-ORBdebuglevel 3           Default: none
                           Recommended debug level is 3 or higher.

Expected output:
----------------
Below is a sample output from run_test.pl on NT.  Please note that
since in this test we are relying on ORB debug messages

1) test output may look different from that shown below as ORB debug
   messages are modified
2) the output may contain some debug information irrelevant to this
   test, e.g., parsed header info in the output below
