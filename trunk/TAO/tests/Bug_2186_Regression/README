This test is the old fave TAO/tests/Hello with some minor(ish) differences.

1/ A ::request_callback method has been added that takes a Hello ref and which prompts a callback to the ::get_string method on that ref.
2/ The server (only) uses a server.conf file which specifies the wait on read client policy (RW).
3/ The client now hosts a transient Hello servant too.
4/ The client calls the servers ::request_callback method passing the reference to the client servant.
5/ The server will call the client back.
6/ The client will exit when its ::request_callback call returns.

The script runs the server as:

server -ORBSvcConf server.conf

And then runs the client *TWICE* as:

client -ORBEndpoint iiop://:23232

The regression error output looks like:

This demonstrates that dropped connections are written to blindly even after the peer has gone when the RW policy is in effect. If the 'server' is started without the -ORBSvcConf argument then the default client connection handler is used and the test runs suceesfully.
