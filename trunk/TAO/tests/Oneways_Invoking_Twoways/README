	This is a sort of a stress test for bug 575. The design of the
	test may not depict real world conditions, but what it gets to
	the fore is a problem that we are trying to fix.

	The test is designed this way. The client makes a oneway call
	to the server.The server, turns around to make a normal
	invocation on the client. The client again tries to make a two
	way invocation on the server as a part of the upcall. Threads
	are created to stress things a bit...

	There is a svcconf file that uses the select reactor. The
	run_test_svc.pl script uses that svcconf file. The test would
	run fine with the select reactor.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
