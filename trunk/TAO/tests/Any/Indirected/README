/**

@page Indirected Any Test README File

This test determines whether some specific aspects of the support
of typecode indirection with recursive typecodes works correctly.
More specifically it tests repeated insertion -> extraction sequences
of the same typecode and memory management with external references of
indirected typecodes.

To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
