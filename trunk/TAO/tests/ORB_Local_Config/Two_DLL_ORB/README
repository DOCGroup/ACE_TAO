This test is intended to demonstrate the ORB-specific configuration
feature. It excesses two basic scenarios, in which a client and a
server ORB exchange a simple message. The twist is that both are
implemented in a DLL of its own and each DLL is loaded through a svc
conf file.

1) If SSLIOP has been compiled, it creates an IIOP server and a
   SSLIOP-capable client.

2) In the absence of SSLIOP, the test uses a CSD dispatching strategy,
   which is made available to the server only.

The test automatically will select which scenario to run, based on the
availability of a certain pre-processor macro. See Test.cpp for
details. By default the scenario 2 is tested, as SSLIOP is not built
by default.

The significance of the SSLIOP scenario is in SSLIOP's implementation,
which turned out precludes using SSLIOP in an ORB-specific
configuration. SSLIOP creates a process-wide singleton, which is
destroyed *before* the TAO SSLIOP service. At shutdown time, an
attempt to access the ACE_SSL_Context results in a SEGV. That is why
the test primary conf file loads the SSLIOP service first, so it ends
up in the global service configuration.
