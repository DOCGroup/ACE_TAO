# Dynamically loading each of the Service Objects below causes a
# number of threads to be spawned, each one invoking the Service
# Configurator (e.g. ACE_Service_Config::process_directive().  If the
# Service Configurator is thread safe and reentrant, then parsing of
# this `Service_Config_Test.conf' file should run to completion
# without error.

# Test_Object_1 will cause Test_Object_2 and Test_Object_3 to be
# dynamically loaded.  Dynamic loading of each of object will occur in
# a separate thread.

# a separate thread.
