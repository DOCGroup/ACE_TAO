This is a test that exercises the birectional GIOP connection
implementation in TAO. Start the server like this

$ server -o <file.ior> -i <no_iterations>
$ client -k file://<file.ior> -x

The server starts up writing the IOR to the file. The client then
starts up, creates its own object and passes the reference to the
server. Then it invokes a method on the server to indicate that it is
ready for callback. The server then callsback the client on the same
connection <no_iterations> times. If the server creates a new
connection the server would crash itself.

To test the fix for bug 3282, run run_test_bug3282.pl or use the commands

$ server -ORBEndpoint iiop://localhost -o <file.ior> -i <no_iterations>
$ client -k file://<file.ior> -x
