The following tests of TAO are provided in this directory.
The individual directories contain READMEs on how to run the tests.

        . Cubit
                
                 Cubit example. The servant returns the cube of the number
                 sent to it by the client. (This example uses hand-generated
                 stubs and skeletons)

        . Demux_test

                This tests various demultiplexing strategies used in
                TAO.    

        . Hello

                A simple TAO-based "Hello World" application. The
                client sends the string "Hello World" to the server,
                and the server prints it out. The stubs and skeletons
                are generated by the IDL compiler automatically, via
                the Makefile provided.

        . IDL_Cubit

                Cubit example with tao_idl compiler generated stubs and
                skeletons


	. MT-Cubit 

		 Multithreaded real-time Cubit example.

	. Thruput_test

		 Throughput tests for TAO, based on TTCP.
