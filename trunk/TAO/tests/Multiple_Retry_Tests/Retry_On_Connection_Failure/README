  This tests shows that by using -ORBForwardOnTransientLimit and -ORBForwardDelay
  options on a client, the client will retry establishing
  a connection to a server before throwing a TRANSIENT exception.

  This is done by having the client start first, wait a few seconds, and then
  start the server.

  To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
