Even if union uses enumeration as discriminant and all possible case
are specified in IDL there are still possible a lot of other values because
enumeration is int internally. Thus we need _default() function for such
unions and handle this case during marshaling/demarshaling.

Successful output:

$>./run_test.pl
Starting Test
Ended Test

Regression output: Basically the test should not compile if there is a
regression. But if it compiles then any ERROR message should indicate the
regression.
