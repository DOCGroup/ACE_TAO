		CORBAplus TTCP Benchmark README file

This directory contains a modified version of the TTCP benchmark that
uses the TAO ORB. TTCP is used to measure the throughput of CORBAplus
for sending different data types. This code tests sequences of short,
long, octet, char, double, and richly-typed data such as a struct.

Organization
------------

client.cpp		Client main program
server.cpp		Server main program
ttcp.cpp		Client side stubs
ttcp_s.cpp		Server side skeletons
ttcp.h			Header file for stubs
ttcp_s.h		Header file for the skeletons
ttcp_i.cpp		Implementaion of the interface
ttcp_i.h		Header for the implementation
utils.cpp		Utilities to calculate throughput
ttcp_decls.h		Common declarations

Results
-------
//Throughput results are stored under the results directory. If testing
//for REMOTE transfers, use the ./results/REMOTE directory.

Running the tests
-----------------
Three scripts are provided

(1) run_server : runs the server. Be sure to change the host name
(2) run_client : runs tests for various data types
(3) run_test : called by run_client

Compiling
---------

Type make

To provide for 2way tests (no data is sent in the reverse
direction. Sender blocks for a minimal ACK), comment out the -DONEWAY
flag from the CPPFLAGS
