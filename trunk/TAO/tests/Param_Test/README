This directory contains an application that tests all the parameter
passing conventions in CORBA for a number of OMG IDL data types.

Type "make" to make the application. The server executable is called
"server" and the client executable is called "client".

You should have the TAO IDL compiler and the TAO library installed
before using this application.

To run the server, type

   server [arguments to ORB_init] [-d]

          arguments to ORB_init start with the letters -ORB. Please
          see TAO documentattion on all the supported arguments

          -d for debugging. It outputs the IOR used by the servant.

To run the client, type

   client [arguments to ORB_init] [options for this application]

   Supported options are:

   [-d]                                 debugging
   [-n loopcount]                       number of times to run the test
   [-k Param_Test-obj-ref-key]          object key of Param_Test object
   [-h hostname]                        host to bind to
   [-p port]                            port number of server
   [-i invocation (sii/dii)]            default is static invocation
                                        interface. To use DII, type
                                        -i dii
   [-t data type]
       Data types supported in this version are:

       short                for shorts
       ubstring             for unbounded string
       fixed_struct         for fixed sized structs
       var_struct           for variable structs
       nested_struct        for nested structs
