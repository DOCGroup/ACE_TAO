This directory contains the following tests for the CDR stream class;

        . basic_types.cpp

          Simply encodes a lot of CORBA::Octets, CORBA::Short and
          CORBA::Long into a CDR stream and then decodes them;
          verifying that the same results are obtained. 

        . growth.cpp
        
          Helps measure how the growth strategy affects the
          performance of CDR streams.

        . tc.cpp
        
          TAO implements TypeCodes using a CDR buffer (this was
          inherited from the Sun IIOP engine), this test verifies that
          some of the basic TypeCodes actually are able to interpret
          their CDR buffers.

These tests take no arguments and return 0 on success.
