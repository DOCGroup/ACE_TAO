This directory contains the following tests for the CDR stream class;

        . basic_types

          Simply encodes a lot of CORBA::Octets, CORBA::Short and
          CORBA::Long into a CDR stream and then decodes them;
          verifying that the same results are obtained.

        . growth

          Helps measure how the growth strategy affects the
          performance of CDR streams.

        . tc

          TAO implements TypeCodes using a CDR buffer (this was
          inherited from the Sun IIOP engine), this test verifies that
          some of the basic TypeCodes actually are able to interpret
          their CDR buffers.

	. allocator

	  Measure the performance and predictability of TSS vs. global
	  allocators.

	. alignment

	  A test for a very subtle alignment problem on the octet
	  sequence optimizations.  Does not happen now, but this is
	  the regression test.
