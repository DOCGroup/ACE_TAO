portspan Test
-------------

The portspan test verifies that the portspan option to the ORB_init() call
behaves correctly. This option allows you to restrict the port that a
server-side ORB will use to listen for IIOP requests, from a given range
of port numbers, starting at a given initial port.

The test works by starting a simple ORB on an endpoint with a portspan of 2.
server -ORBEndpoint iiop://:5555/portspan=2
The test script does this three times and reports an error if the first two
don't succeed, or if the third call doesn't fail.
