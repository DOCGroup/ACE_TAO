portspan Test
-------------

The portspan test verifies that the portspan option to ORB_init() call
behaves correctly. This option allows to restrict the port that a 
server-side ORB will use to listen for IIOP requests, from a given range
of port numbers, starting at a given initial port.

This test tests the following four test cases.
1) Checks if the server has been started at the first free port available
in the range.
2) Checks if the server has been started at the first free port 
available after explicitly making some of the ports within the range 
unavailable.
3) Checks if the server has been started at the first free port 
available after explicitly making all but the last ports within the range 
unavailable.
4) See if BAD_PARAM exception is raised if all ports within the
range are unavailable. 

To run the test:

./run_test.pl <initial port> <port range>
