@page ForwardUponObjectNotExist Test README File

$Id$

	This is test for feature of request forwarding when client receives
	OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception. The feature is enabled and disabled by
	-ORBForwardInvocationOnObjectNotExist [0|1] option.

	The servant implementation is made to raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception.
	This is	to simulate the server exception reply regardless the actual
	meaning of the OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception. The test also takes advantage
	of the IORTable facilities in TAO to create a simple corbaloc IOR, TAO
	always responds with a LOCATION_FORWARD message when a request is
	made for an object in the IORTable. This would make the stub have the
	forward address upon receiving OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception so it can
	perform the forwarding. If client runs with the feature disabled
	(-ORBForwardInvocationOnObjectNotExist 0) then the client should catch
	the OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception, otherwise, the request will be looping
	between server and client and the invocation never ends. The invocation
	finally ends because of the server shutdown.

	To execute the test simply run:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 on success and non-zero on failures.
