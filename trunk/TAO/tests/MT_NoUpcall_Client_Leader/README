The test simulates a case when an incomming requests is being detected while a
client-leader thread is waiting in the reactor event loop for its own reply.

The server uses MT_NOUPCALL client connection handling strategy. The defect was
in the fact that while the above described incomming request was correctly not
being handled, the corresponding transport handle remained suspended. This
caused the reactor to exclude that handle from the read mask and it never gave
other followers a chance to read from that handle. Eventually, these requests
remained "ignored"

The resolution is to resume the handle *and* notify the reactor when an
incomming requests is being detected, while a client-leader thread is waiting
in the reactor event loop for its own reply. Thus, if any follower threads are
available, they can pick it up and process it eventually.

A rapidly increasing spin prevention back-off delay helps to mitigate the
negative influence of this solution over the processor utilization.

Run the test by starting the server:

  ./server -ORBSvcConf mt_noupcall.conf

And the client:

  ./client

If any requests get "ignored" the server process will hang indefinitely.
