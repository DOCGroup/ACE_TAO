This directory contains a number of very simple tests, which also
illustrate how to write canonical Orbix/VisiBroker/OmniORB examples in
TAO using standard CORBA features rather than proprietary ORB
features.  The individual directories contain READMEs on how to run
the following tests:

        . bank
        
          This directory implements the canonical VisiBroker
          test.

        . chat
        
          This directory implements an ORBacus test.

        . echo
        
          This directory implements the canonical omniORB test.

        . grid
        
          This directory implements the canonical Orbix test.

        . time
          
          This directory implements a simple time/date test.
