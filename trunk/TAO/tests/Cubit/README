		Cubit 

This is the example from the SunSoft's IIOP 1.4 distribution modified
to work with TAO.  In addition, there is a Cubit example for Orbix and
VisiBroker.

There are three versions of the Cubit example. Individual README files
in the respective directories explain these versions in further
detail.
