How to run the cubit example on UNIX
------------------------------------

server:
-------

% svr [-d] -ORBhost <hostname> [-orbport <portnum>]

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  It is additive, i.e., the more
-d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the moment,
only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d options
are ignored.

client:
-------
% clnt [-d] -n <iterations> -O <IOR string displayed by server>


Running the Examples

<P>You will find the tests executables in $TAO_ROOT/tests directory.
The Debug files are <CODE>client.exe</CODE> and
<CODE>server.exe</CODE>.  The Release versions are
<CODE>client-r.exe</CODE> and <CODE>server-r.exe</CODE>.  You will
need to add the directories containing the ACE and TAO DLLS to your
path before you can run the Cubit test.</P>

<P>To run the server, type in <CODE>server -OAhost <EM>serverhost</EM> 
-d</CODE> where <CODE><EM>serverhost</EM></CODE> is the name of the machine 
that the server is running on. When the server is started, you should see as 
the first line of output something that looks like 
<CODE>iiop:1.0//serverhost:5001/key00</CODE>.  You will need this when you run 
the client.</P>

<P>At another prompt (on the same machine or a different machine) type in 
<CODE>client -O <EM>IIOP</EM></CODE> where <CODE><EM>IIOP</EM></CODE> is the 
name that the server gave you.</P>
