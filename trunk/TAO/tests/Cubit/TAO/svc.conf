#
# This file contains a sample ACE_Service_Config configuration
# file specifying the strategy factories utilized by an application
# using TAO.  There are currently only two possible factories:
# Client_Strategy_Factory and Server_Strategy_Factory.  These names
# must be used as the second argument to their corresponding line,
# because that's what the ORB uses to find the desired factory.
#
# Note that there are two unordinary characteristics of the way *this*
# file is set up:
#   - both client and server strategies are specified in the same
#     file, which would only make sense for co-located clients & servers
#   - both of the factories are actually sourced out of libTAO.so
#     (TAO.DLL on Win32), and they would normally be in a separate
#     dll from the TAO ORB Core.
#
# The options which can be passed to the Client are:
#     <none currently>
#
# The options which can be passed to the Server are:
#   -T
#       specifies use of the ACE_Threaded_Strategy concurrency strategy
#       (mutually exclusive with -R)
#   -t  <flags>
#       specifies the default thread flags to use, where <flags> is a
#       logical OR'ing of the flags THR_DETACHED, THR_BOUND, THR_NEW_LWP,
#       THR_SUSPENDED, or THR_DAEMON.  Note that not every flag may be valid
#       on every platform.
#   -R
#       specifies use of the ACE_Reactive_Strategy concurrency strategy
#       (mutually exclusive with -T)
#   -L dynamic | linear | active | user
#       specifies the type of object lookup strategy used internally
#   -s <unsigned>
#       specified the size of the object table
#
