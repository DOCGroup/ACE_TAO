The MT-Cubit example
--------------------

Compiling
---------

Makefiles are provided. Use make to compile.

You can either run the server in the background in the same window as
the client or open a separate window for the client and server.

server:
-------

./svr -p <port_num> -h <my_hostname> -t <number_of_servants>

port_num is the port number at which the server will start the first
(and highest priority) servant. Successive servants will be created
starting at (port_num+1). The -n parameter specifies the total number
of servants. 

The server will print the IOR of the servants, but it is not required
by the client.

client:
-------

./client -d <datatype> -p <port_num> -h <server_hostname> -n <num_calls> -t <num_of_clients>

<datatype> is one of the following:

0 Octet
1 Short
2 Long
3 Struct of the above 3 types

<port_num> is the port number of the highest priority servant and
should be the same as the port_num supplied to the server, as
described earlier. The lower priority servant is assumed to be at
(port_num+1).

<server_hostname> is the hostname of the server.

Based on the server_hostname and the port_num, the client
automatically constructs the IOR's for the servants

<num_calls> is the number of CORBA twoway calls to be made

<num_of_clients> is the total number of concurrent clients to be
created. The clients will have successively decreasing
priorities. Hence, with 3 clients, the 1st client will have the highest
priority, the 2nd client will have lower priority, and the 3rd will have
the lowest priority.

Results
-------

The client prints the latency observed by the high priority client,
and the average latency observed by the low priority clients. Jitter
(standard deviation of the latency) is also printed by the client.
