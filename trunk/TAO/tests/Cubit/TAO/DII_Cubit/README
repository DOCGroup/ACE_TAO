This is the cubit example that makes DII requests. It uses the
server in IDL_Cubit (actually the Cubit factory). A DII request is
made on the Cubit factory (it's IOR is displayed when the server is run)
to get the current Cubit object. Then the operations are called on that
Cubit object usign DII requests.

Open a separate window (in IDL_Cubit) and run the server, then run the 
client in DII_Cubit. No nameservice functionality yet, so you have to
manually type in the IOR for now :-(

In another window (on the same machine or a different machine) type in
client -i <IOR> where IOR is the displayed factory IOR. To make typing
a little easier, run the server with [-ORBobjrefstyle url] so the 
displayed string will be shorter and easier to copy.

Default number of loops for the timing tests is 250, but it can be set
from the command line following [-n <# of loops>]. Other arguments are 
supported, as shown in parse_args in client.cpp.
