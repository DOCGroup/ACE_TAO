This is the cubit example that uses hand-generated stubs and
skeletons.  Once we've got a real DII C++ mapping in TAO, we'll modify
this to use that mapping.

You can either run the server in the background in the same window as
the client or open a separate window for the client and server.

server:
-------

% svr [-d] -ORBhost <serverhost> [-orbport <portnum>]

When the server is started and you have used the -d flag, you should
see as the first line of output something that looks like
iiop:1.0//serverhost:10013/key00.  You will need this when you run the
client.

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  It is additive, i.e., the more
-d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the moment,
only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d options
are ignored.

client:
-------

% clnt [-d] -n <iterations> -O <IOR string displayed by server>

In another window (on the same machine or a different machine) type in
client -O IIOP where IIOP is the name that the server gave you.
