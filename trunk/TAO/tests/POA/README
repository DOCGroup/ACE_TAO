// $Id$

The following TAO applications test and illustate various Portable
Object Adapter (POA) interfaces and their usage scenarios.

        . Identity

                The example shows the identity between servants, ids,
                and references.

        . Destruction

                The program tests the destruction of a POA during an
                upcall.

        . Deactivation

                This program tests the reactivation of a servant that
                has been deactivated but not removed from the Active
                Object Map yet.

        . Non_Servant_Upcalls

                This program check the users ability to make calls on
                a POA during non-servant upcalls.  In this example, a
                servant which is being destroyed during because of a
                deactivate_object() call, tries to deactivate another
                object in its destructor.

        . wait_for_completion

                This program tests the <wait_for_completion> feature
                of the POA.

        . Single_Threaded_POA 

                This program tests to make sure that two threads
                cannot call servants in a single threaded POA
                simultaneously.  At the same time, it makes sure that
                a servant can call itself or other servants in the
                same POA while in an upcall.
