The following TAO applications explain the various POA interfaces and their usage scenarios.
Individual README files in the respective directories explain these applications further.
        . RootPOA

                This example explains how to obtain the name of the RootPOA.

        . NewPOA

                This example explains the operations involved in creation of new POAs.

        . FindPOA

                This example explains registering an adapter activator for a POA and also the find_POA operation.

        . Default_Servant 


        . Generic_Servant

                A simple interface (Foo) is defined here and its implementations, server and client programs are
                availabale, which can be used for testing POA applications.
                The client program in this library is used for testing the Explicit_Activation example.

        . On_Demand_Activation 



        . Explicit_Activation

                This example does not work as of now. It will be fixed soon. This application explains
                various operations involved in the explicit activation of objects.
                < It compiles. At run, _narrow() of the client raises exception. >
