// $Id$

The following TAO applications test and illustate various Portable
Object Adapter (POA) interfaces and their usage scenarios.

        . Identity

                The example shows the identity between servants, ids,
                and references.

        . Destruction

                The program tests the destruction of a POA during an
                upcall.

        . Deactivation

                This program tests the reactivation of a servant that
                has been deactivated but not removed from the Active
                Object Map yet.
