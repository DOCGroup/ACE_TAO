@page EndpointPolicy Test README File

  This test validates the TAO-specific Endpoint Policy. The Endpoint Policy
  is applied to a POAManager via the POAManagerFactory, it is not applied to
  individual POAs. Any POA associated with an endpoint constrained POAManager
  is subject to the same constraint.

  The server in this test takes one or more localhost-based -ORBEndpoint
  arguments. A second argument supplies the "correct" port number to be used
  to create an Endpoint Policy value. Internally, the server creates an
  invalid endpoint using the hostname_in_ior option for -ORBEndpoint.

  Two Endpoint Policy instances are created, one using localhost and the
  supplied port number, and another creating an invalid endpoint. These are
  then supplied to the separate POAManagers which are then used to create
  new POAs. Object references are created on each of the root, good, and bad
  POAs.

  The client is then passed an IOR and a flag indicating this is expected to
  succeed or fail. The test succeeds if the client can use the good IOR and
  gets an exception using the bad IOR.

  To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  Beyond the basic test run using run_test.pl, there are two variants,
  a localhost based test and a "defaulted host" test. The localhost test
  uses "localhost" as the hostname rather than allowing the server to 
  get the systems hostname. The Localhost test is not when autorunning
  on the vxworks platform.

  To run the localhost test:

$ ./run_test_lh.pl

  In the defaulted host test, the hostname argument supplied to the 
  endpoint policy is "". As discussed in Bug #3256, the behavior of
  using defaulted hosts is changed so that unless more than one
  protocol are involved, a defaulted hostname is not allowed in the
  Endpoint Policy value list.

  The defaulted host test only runs the server program, not the client.
  It is run this way:

$ ./run_test_dh.pl
