This application explains the usage scenario, where new POAs will have
to be created.

Run this example as follows.

% NewPOA.

Comments :
=========

 - Creates the POA hierarchy as given in the header of the NewPOA.cpp 
   file.
        
 - Prints out names of all the POAs.

 - It prints out two warning messages, since there is no Resource Factory  
   and Strategy Factory found in the Service Repository.

   It takes the default instances of the Resource and Strategy Factories.

   These Default factories are ok for this simple application.
