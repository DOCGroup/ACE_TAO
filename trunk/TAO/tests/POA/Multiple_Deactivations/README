/**

@page POA Multiple Deactivations Test README File

	Regression test for:

	http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=834

	The test creates a single object reference and deactivates it
	three times in the context of a request.   The servant
	verifies that the destructor is not invoked in this context,
	and that reference counting rules are properly followed.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
