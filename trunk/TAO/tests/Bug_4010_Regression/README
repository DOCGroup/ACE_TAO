@page Bug 4010 Regression Test

This test demonstrates bug 4010.

The IDL and server code are unchanged from the basic Hello test.

The client is modified to perform the Hello test periodically for
different instances of the server.

The server is run twice to demonstrate the client's attempt to reuse a stale
connection from the first instance to contact an object reference from the second.
The endpoint is assigned for the server to demonstrate the COMM_FAILURE exception on
a stale transport.


  To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

  the script returns 0 if the test was successful.

The expected output would look something like this -

(7715|3072272080) - string returned <Hello there!>
(7714|3070171360) server - event loop finished
(7715|3072272080) - shutdown requested
(7715|3072272080) - string returned <Hello there!>
(7715|3072272080) - shutdown requested
(7716|3071477984) server - event loop finished

With the bug, the output looks like this -
(7731|3072239312) - string returned <Hello there!>
(7724|3072022752) server - event loop finished
(7731|3072239312) - shutdown requested
(7731|3072239312) EXCEPTION, Exception caught:
system exception, ID 'IDL:omg.org/CORBA/COMM_FAILURE:1.0'
TAO exception, minor code = 0 (failed to recv request response; unspecified errno), completed = MAYBE
