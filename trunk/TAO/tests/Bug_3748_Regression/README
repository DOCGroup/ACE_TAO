This test registers orb initializer which in turn registers Test_Protocol_Hooks.
This is necessary for emulation of failure in TAO_IIOP_Connection_Handler::open()
and probable in this case handle leak.
TAO_IIOP_Connection_Handler::open() calls server_protocol_properties_at_orb_level()
in Test_Protocol_Hooks and we throw an exception to make it fail.
