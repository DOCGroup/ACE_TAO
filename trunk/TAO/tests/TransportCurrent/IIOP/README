This test has two parts, which run automatically:

Part 1:

IIOP_Transport_Current test: Demonstrates how in the application the
user can resolve the IIOP_Transport_Current and use it to obtain
IIOP-related transport properties for the current Transport.

Part 2:

Multi threading test: In this test the server has a Thread Pool. Using
Interceptors, the test tracks the transports that are used in the
individual invocations at various stage of the up-call. This validates
that the TC framework accurately tracks the correct transport for an
invocation, no matter what stage of the up-call in a multi-threaded
environment.

We force creation of multiple transport by using the: static
Client_Strategy_Factory "-ORBTransportMuxStrategy exclusive"
directive. While this isn't 100% guaranteed, having multiple client
threads and making simultaneous invocations should trigger new transport
creation (as it did in lab conditions).

See ../Framework/README for more detail on how and what contexts are
tested.
