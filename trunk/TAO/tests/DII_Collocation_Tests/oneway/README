Description:
This test is used to test the bug fix on collocated dii oneway request
invocation via send_oneway() crash on get_in_arg() when the request has multiple
"IN" parameters.

The test.idl defines oneway operations with all sorts SArgument to test the
conversion of the DII parameters in NVList to the list of arguments.
It also defines the operations with multiple "IN" arguments to test the
bug fix.

This test is a modification of the Collocation_Tests. The big difference is
this test invokes the oneway operations using DII while the Collocation_Tests
invoke a simple twoway operations.

Usage:
=====

The run_test.pl runs several test cases listed below. The test result will be printed
after the test completes. To debug the test failure, the operation "-d" can be passed
to have verbose log.
