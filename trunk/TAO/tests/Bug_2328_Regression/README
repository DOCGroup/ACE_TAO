This test sends 3 strings to the server. The server is using the codeset
library, the client is configured that it doesn't use it. This gives a marshal
exception in TAO 1.4.7 because it uses UTF8 Latin1 to demarshal the strings
which then causes things to go wrong in the stream.

        To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
