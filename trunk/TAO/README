Welcome to the alpha release of The ACE ORB (TAO).  TAO is an
implementation of a CORBA2-compliant ORB that will support real-time
extensions.  Please see http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html for
more information on TAO.

The current alpha release of TAO contains the following:

* An optimized ORB Core based on ACE components;

* An implementation of a Basic Object Adapter (BOA);

* Various sample applications illustrating how to use the ORB in its
  current state.

This release of TAO does not yet contain the following:

* An IDL compiler

* An real-time version of the new Portable Object Adapter (POA)

* The real-time scheduling service

We plan to release these features throughout the summer of 1997.

Please feel free to experiment with, dissect, repair, use, etc., TAO.
We gratefully accept bug reports, appreciate bug fixes/enhancements,
and will strive to integrate correct bug fixes quickly!  Just remember
that TAO does not provide all the features of a commercial ORB at the
moment.  Moreover, key components in TAO (e.g., the Object Adapter)
will change substantially over the summer.  Thus, any development
performed in the interim will require additional effort (e.g., writing
stubs and skeletons by hand), and applications may need to be
re-written to work with new features in the forthcoming releases.
