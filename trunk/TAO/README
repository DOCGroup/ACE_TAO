Welcome to TAO--The ACE ORB.  This is an implementation of a
CORBA2-compliant ORB with support for real-time extensions.

As mentioned, TAO will eventually be a CORBA2-compliant ORB.  But
right now it's not there.  Specifically, TAO contains the following:
* an [optimized] ORB Core based on ACE components
* an implementation of the Basic Object Adapter (BOA)
* various sample applications illustrating how to use the ORB in its
  current state

The current release of TAO DOES NOT contain the following:
* an IDL compiler
* an real-time version of the new Portable Object Adapter (POA)
* a real-time scheduling service

Our current shedule will provide these remaining features throughout
the summer of 1997.

Please feel free to experiment with, dissect, repair, use, etc., TAO.
We accept bug reports, appreciate bug fixes/enhancements, and quickly
integrate correct bug fixes!  Just remember that we do not expect TAO
to provide all the features of a real ORB at the moment, and that very
important parts of TAO will be changing substantially in the
not-so-distant future.  Thus, any development performed in the interim
will require a little more effort, and will likely have to be
completely re-written to work with newer releases.
