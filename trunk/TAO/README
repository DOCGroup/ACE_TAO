Welcome to the latest release of The ACE ORB (TAO).  TAO is a freely
available, open-source implementation of a CORBA 2.x-compliant ORB
that supports real-time extensions.  Please see
www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html for more information on TAO.

Detailed information on this version of TAO is available in the
$TAO_ROOT/docs subdirectory in HTML format.

The current release of TAO contains the following components:

     * An ORB Core based on ACE C++ components. This ORB Core provides
       3 concurrency models: (1) Reactive, (2) Thread-per-Connection,
       and (3) Thread-per-Rate (which is optimized for certain types
       of deterministic real-time systems).

     * A highly optimized version of the SunSoft IIOP protocol engine.

     * An implementation of the Portable Object Adapter (POA)
       specification.

     * An IDL compiler, based on the SunSoft IDL compiler.  This IDL
       compiler can generate compiled or interpreted stubs/skeletons
       that use TAO's optimized IIOP protocol engine.  In addition,
       TAO's IDL compiler generates stubs/skeletons that support both
       native C++ exceptions and the original CORBA::Environment
       approach.

     * A Real-time Scheduling Service that determines the priority at
       which Client requests are dispatched by the ORB.

     * A Real-time Event Service that dispatches CORBA events in
       real-time.

     * Implementations of the CORBA Naming Service, Trading
       Service, Concurrency Service, Audio/Video Streaming Service,
       Property Service, and a Logging Service.
       
     * Many tests illustrating how to use TAO and measuring
       TAO's performance.
       
We've gotten TAO to interoperate with other ORBs (e.g., Orbix,
VisiBroker, miniCOOL, and CORBAplus), so we're confident that its
implementation of IIOP is robust.  We're currently working on the
following features for TAO:
   
     * A highly extensible, highly optimized set of request
       demultiplexing strategies that provide constant time lookup of
       servants based on object keys and operation names contained in
       CORBA requests.

We plan to release these features throughout the fall of 1998.  You
can keep track of our progress online at URL

A quick build note for users who have used ACE with other ORBs:
linking TAO with a version of ACE that must also be linked against
another ORB vendor's library, e.g., liborbix.so, will produce
undefined and most likely unpredictable and erroneous results.

We welcome suggestions for improvement, bug fixes, portability
enhancements, etc. and will strive to integrate correct bug fixes
quickly!  If you have any questions or problems with TAO, please post
them to the ACE mailing list (ace-users@cs.wustl.edu) or send email to
Douglas C. Schmidt (schmidt@cs.wustl.edu) and Nanbor Wang
(nanbor@cs.wustl.edu).
