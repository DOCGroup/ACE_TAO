		TAO_TTCP Benchmark README file

This directory contains a modified version of the TTCP benchmark that
uses the TAO ORB. TAO_TTCP is used to measure the throughput of TAO
for sending different data types. This code tests sequences of short,
long, octet, char, double, and richly-typed data such as a struct.
This benchmark uses an interpretive form of marshaling the data by
using the dynamic invocation interfaces provided by the TAO ORB.

Organization
------------

client.cpp		Client main program
server.cpp		Server main program
ttcpC.cpp		Client side stubs
ttcpS.cpp		Server side skeletons
ttcpC.h			Header file for stubs
ttcpS.h			Header file for the skeletons
ttcp_i.cpp		Implementaion of the interface
ttcp_i.h		Header for the implementation
utils.cpp		Utilities to calculate throughput
ttcp_decls.h		Common declarations

Results
-------
Throughput results are stored under the results directory. If testing
for REMOTE transfers, use the ./results/REMOTE directory.

Running the tests
-----------------
Three scripts are provided

(1) run_server : runs the server. Be sure to change the host name
(2) run_client : runs tests for various data types
(3) run_test : called by run_client

Compiling
---------

Type make

To provide for 2way tests (no data is sent in the reverse
direction. Sender blocks for a minimal ACK), comment out the -DONEWAY
flag from the CPPFLAGS
