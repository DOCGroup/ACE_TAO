A new version of The ACE ORB (TAO) has been released by the Disitributed 
Object Computing (DOC) Group at Washington University in St. Louis, and 
can be downloaded from the Internet.

TAO is a freely-licensed CORBA 2.x-compliant ORB which uses IIOP 1.0 as 
its default inter-ORB communication protocol.  TAO also sports the first 
(as far as we know) implementation of the OMG's Portable Object Adapter 
(POA) architecture!

TAO has been ported to OS platforms including Windows NT 4.x using MSVC++, 
several versions of UNIX (e.g., Solaris 2.x, SGI IRIX 6.x, Linux, SCO, 
NetBSD, and FreeBSD), and Real-Time OS's (RTOSs) (e.g., VxWorks and 
Chorus).  Ultimately, TAO will be ported to all OS platforms on which ACE 
runs.  We have used TAO to interwork with other ORBs (e.g., Orbix, COOL, 
CORBAPlus, and VisiBroker), so we're confident that its IIOP implementation 
is robust and interoperable.

It's version information is:

For information on installation and system requirements, please see 
TAO-INSTALL.html (or INSTALL) in the root directory of the unpacked tar 
file.

Note that ACE is required to build TAO.  Typically the most recent beta 
release is required--see the installation notes for more details.  Other 
documentation is available in the 'docs/' directory (in HTML).

Thanks for trying TAO!
