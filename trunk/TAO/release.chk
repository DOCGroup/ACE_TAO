Legend:
	Platforms are indicated by position within square brackets, i.e.,
	[ABCDEF] where

	A = Solaris/CC
	B = NT (MSVC++ 5.0)
	C = Solaris/g++
	D = IRIX
	E = Linux/g++
	F = Other (Linux/egcs, Solaris/egcs, etc.)

	The state is indicated as a tri-state value, e.g.,

	0 = doesn't work
	1 = works
	x = not attempted or unknown

NOTES
* Solaris/CC

* NT
** Warnings on libTAO and tao_idl compilation.
** Param_Test with struct_seq segfaults server.
** MT_Cubit client segfaults after transactions made.

* Solaris/g++
** Warnings during tao_idl compilation.
** SII,DII struct_seq causes a bus error on the server.
** SII objref causes marshal exceptions, but no fatalities.
** DII objref client gets illegal instruction.
** orbsvcs fails with missing stuff in ACE_Map_Manager.
** MT_Cubit gets relocation error on startup:
   ld.so.1: ./svr: fatal: relocation error: symbol not found:
   ACE_Task_Base::activate(long, int, int, long, int, ACE_Task_Base *,
   unsigned int *): referenced in ./svr

* IRIX
** Event Latency won't work because unproper detection of failures for
   priority change.
   MT_Cubit does not compile due to extra library (-lposix4) only
   present in Solaris; IMHO that should go into the platform file for
   Solaris/CC

* Linux/g++
* Other (Linux/egcs, Solaris/egcs, etc.)
