          Zapped all environment macros except ACE_THROW_SPEC and ACE_THROW_RETURN.

        * *.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Zapped part of the environment macros from everything except the core TAO
          libs, more follow later, first let us stabilize this commit. The goal is to
          get rid of all environment macros
