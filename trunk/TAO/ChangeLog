        * tao/Strategies.mpc:
          Now build with ace_for_tao but derive from core_strategies

        * tao/tao.mpc:
          Added new HTTP files and moved all sequence.pidl files to one
          group because soon they all will get a special tao_idl argument
          to be used.

        * tao/TAO_Internal.cpp:
        * tao/default_resource.cpp:
          Added HTTP

        * tao/GUIResource_Factory.{h,cpp}:
          Changed dynamically_allocated_reactor to bool

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Changed has_shutdown to a real bool

        * tao/Valuetype/ValueBase.h:
          Doxygen improvement

          Explicitly add avoids += ace_for_tao to these projects. At this
          moment they are not build because the strategies library is not
          available with ace_for_tao, but this is something I will change
          but besides strategies these projects do use some ACE classes
          which are not available in the ace_for_tao configuration

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/ECG_CDR_Message_Receiver.cpp:
          Const improvement

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/UDP/Consumer.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/UDP/receiver.cpp:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/UDP/Supplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Event/UDP/Test.idl:
          Extended this test and reproduced the bug we had in CIAO. This
          test now will fail until Jeff Parsons commits some related
          valuetype changes.

        * Release:
          Removed dsw files

        * docs/ORBEndpoint.html:
          Added reuse_addr to the list of options, request has been made
          to OCI to check and extend the documentation of this option
          which has been available starting TAO 1.4.8

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          Removed check for IFR_Client, we do have an empty A.h file for
          the IFR_Client files now

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:
          Updated help of -GA

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/NVList.cpp:
          Use true/false

        * tao/HTTP_Client.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/HTTP_Handler.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/HTTP_Parser.{h,cpp}:
          New files to support http:/ as IOR format

        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
          Removed check for priority, that is gone already a long time and
          this takes footprint.

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Const changes and removed TAO_Synchronous_Cancellation_Required which
          doesn't seem used at all.
