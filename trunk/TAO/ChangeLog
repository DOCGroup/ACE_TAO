        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL_Tests.mpc:

          Since the below modification removed the -GA from the valuetype.idl
          generation step in the mpc file, the valuetypeA.cpp is now
          not generated, thus this file should not be mentioned in the
          DLL projects Source_Files section. Machines were compiling and
          linking the old file or stating that it was not found.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype.cpp:

          Added missing switch cases in visit_union() and visit_typedef().
          Not all context states were covered and we were seeing errors
          and bailouts.

        * tests/IDL_Test/valuetype.idl:
        * tests/IDL_Test/IDL_Tests.mpc:

          Added test case for the above problem, also removed -GA IDL
          compiler option for valuetype.idl, since the new test case
          has IDL constructed types declared inside a valuetype - the
          generated typecode for the nested types cannot be in a separate
          file since the generated valuetype class declaration cannot
          be reopened. Thanks to Simon Massey <simon dot massey at
          prismtech dot com> for reporting the problem and supplying
          example IDL.

          Improving this test, looks the crashing on some build systems is
          mostly timing due to a badly written example
