	* orbsvcs/examples/FaultTolerance/RolyPoly: Changed the use of
	  TMCast to ACE_TMCast.  Thanks to J.T. Conklin for pointing out
 	  the inconsistency.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp (DRV_cpp_init):
        
          Moved the location of the check for the preprocessor
          definition of TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR to come after the
          checks for TAO_ROOT and ACE_ROOT. This move changes
          the logic so the environment variable is used if it is
          set and TAO_IDL_INCLUDE_DIR is used otherwise, enabling
          the path to orb.idl to be found both during and after
          installation. Thanks to Ken Sedgwick <ken@bonsai.com>
          for supplying the patch.

	* tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_object_reference_sequence.hpp:
	  Implement unbounded sequences of object references.

	* tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests.mpc:
	* tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/run_test.pl:
	* tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/unbounded_object_reference_sequence_ut.cpp:
	  Add a new unit test (still in progress) to test the object
	  reference sequences.

	* tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/generic_sequence.hpp:
	  Fixed a performance bug in length(...), the sequence was
	  reallocated and grown when not strictly needed.
	  Document in more detail why some code is not exception-safe, and
	  why it may not matter (applications that could depend on it are
	  non-conforming.)

	* tests/Sequence_Unit_Tests/string_sequence_element.hpp:
	  Add missing #include.

        * orbsvcs/PSS/PSDL_Interface_Visitor.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/PSS/PSDL_Struct_Visitor.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/PSS/PSDL_Type_Dcl_Visitor.cpp:
          Removed generation of check for ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8, this is not
          set anywhere anymore

          Removed check for ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8, this is not set anywhere
          anymore

Sat Jan  1 13:41:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tao/IIOP_Endpoint.cpp:
          Updated formatting of some debug messages to match the other
          messages in TAO

        * tao/ORBInitInfo.h:
          Removed check for _MSC_VER >= 1200, this is always true, removed
          check for ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8, this define is nowhere set and
          such old versions of GCC aren't usable anymore

        * tao/UTF16_BOM_Factory.cpp:
          Check argc before using argv[0], this can be unitialized memory
          under VxWorks.

        * TAO-INSTALL.html:
          Corrected e-mail address of the TAO mailing list
