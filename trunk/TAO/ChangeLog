        * Release:
          Removed dsw files

        * docs/ORBEndpoint.html:
          Added reuse_addr to the list of options, request has been made
          to OCI to check and extend the documentation of this option
          which has been available starting TAO 1.4.8

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:
          Removed check for IFR_Client, we do have an empty A.h file for
          the IFR_Client files now

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_global.cpp:
          Updated help of -GA

        * tao/AnyTypeCode/NVList.cpp:
          Use true/false

        * tao/HTTP_Client.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/HTTP_Handler.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/HTTP_Parser.{h,cpp}:
          New files to support http:/ as IOR format

        * tao/IIOP_Acceptor.cpp:
          Removed check for priority, that is gone already a long time and
          this takes footprint.

        * tao/Stub.cpp:
          Const changes and removed TAO_Synchronous_Cancellation_Required which
          doesn't seem used at all.
