        * tao/TAO_Server_Request.cpp:
        * tao/Transport_Selection_Guard.h:

          Eliminating duplication of the transport_ member from
          TAO_Server_Request. The Transport_Selection_Guard is a
          smart pointer, designed to work both as a normal pointer
          and with the transport current feature. When TC is disabled,
          it is also lightweight enough to avoid footprint increase.
          This fixes bugzilla 2991.

        * tao/MCAST_Parser.cpp:
          Made so that an opened datagram socket has a proper protocol
          family. This fixes TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/run_test.pl
          of IPv6 builds.
