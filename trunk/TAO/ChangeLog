        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_valuetype/valuetype_ss.cpp:

          Changed the copy constructor for generated skeleton-side
          valuetype classes private and unimplemented. Skeleton
          code is generated for valuetypes only if they support a
          concrete interface. However, these valuetypes also inherit
          from the stub-side valuetype class, which has a private
          unimplemented copy constructor. This fact makes it
          problematic to generate a valid copy constructor for the
          skeleton-side class, since C++ (and many compilers) require each
          base class copy constructor to be called in the
          initialization list.

        * TAO_IDL/ast/ast_module.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/include/ast_module.h:

          Modified look_in_previous() by adding a boolean parameter to
          optionally ignore forward declared types when iterating
          over the declarations in previous openings of a module. This
          new parameter is false by default, so that ordinary lookups
          will behave as always. In AST_Module::referenced() however,
          the argument is passed as true explicitly, to avoid
          redefinition errors for forward delcared types that appear
          in an opening of a module previous to the one in which they
          are fully defined, and also referenced before the full
          definition appears. Thanks to Aaron <crackajaxx@gmail.com>
          for reporting the problem and sending example IDL files>.

        * tao/TSS_Resources.h (instance):

          Hide TAO_TSS_Singleton behind new TAO_TSS_Resources::instance()
          method.  Addresses multiple TAO_TSS_Singleton instances on
          platforms/compilers that support symbol hiding, but for which we
          do not yet have an appropriate *_SINGLETON_DECLARATION() macro,
          such as g++ 4.0.  Fixes problems where an incorrect singleton
          instance is returned to the caller.

          Removed unnecessary zero pointer check before operator delete()
          call.  Calling operator delete() on a zero pointer is perfectly
          valid.

          Moved generated virtual methods out of line.  Inlining them
          causes RTTI problems when the stubs are compiled with g++ 4.0's

          Added a virtual destructor.  Even though this class only defines
          an interface, an out-of-line virtual destructor is necessary to
          avoid dynamic_cast<> failures when using g++ 4.0's
          -fvisibility-inlines-hidden command line option.  Apparently the
          compiler generated destructor is inlined.

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/NT_Naming_Service.{h,cpp}:

          For Windows platforms, changed how the handle_control() stops
          the ORB. Instead of having to explicitly stop the reactor loop
          it only needs to call ORB::shutdown(). This also avoids a
          potential race condition that may occur as the ORB gets
          destroy()-ed between the two calls. Added an AutoFinalizer
          class, whose destructor notifies the Windows SCM by calling
          ACE_NT_Service::report_status() when an instance goes out of
          scope. This is helpful in the presence of unexpected
          exceptions.  This patch was forward-ported from 1.3a_p9, based
          upon RT4982.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Storable_Naming_Context.cpp:

Tue May 17 15:14:55 2005  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <jeliazkov_i@ociweb.com>

          This change allows bi-directional policy to work with SSLIOP
          endpoints.  When a server accepts a client-initiated
          connection or a listen point list, there is no data available
          about the IIOP endpoints, underlying the SSLIOP endpoints.
          There is also no data for most of the attributes of the secure
          connection.  Therefore the "server" must synthesize those,
          however this can not be done correctly. The problem becomes
          evident when bi-directional policy is in effect for both
          peers: a "server" during callback, needs to use the same
          connection the "client" has initiated, but the secure endpoint
          obtained from an IOR can not yield the same hash value as the
          synthesized endpoint (from an LPL), used to cache the
          connection.  Also, such endpoints can not be equivalent, in
          terms of the is_equivalent () method. The IOR from the client
          contains the real (non-synthetic) port number for the IIOP
          endpoint underlying the SSL endpoint.  This causes the server
          to decide that it deals with a different endpoint and try to
          open a new connection. When the ORBs are using bi-directional
          policies and are behind a firewall, this will fail

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp:

          Creates an instance of the new SSLIOP_Synthetic_Endpoint,
          which it then uses to re-cache the transport.
          TAO_SSLIOP_Connection_Handler::add_transport_to_cache()
          ultimately uses the is_equivalent () method to compare
          endpoints. That method must not compare the underlying IIOP
          port numbers, because in some cases SSLIOP endpoints are
          instantiated with limited amount of information available. For
          example, when accepting a connections in server role, the
          underlying IIOP endpoint's port is unknown an is merely
          assigned to be the same as the secure port, effectively
          precludes the ability of the server to find a connection
          cached with these parameters later.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/SSLIOP_Endpoint.{h,cpp):

          Introduced a new SSLIOP_Synthetic_Endpoint, which relaxes the
          equivalence comparison with another SSLIOP_Endpoint to limit
          it to only hostname, SSL port and QoP.
          Changed the hash() implementation in SSLIOP_Endpoint to
          eliminate any influence the embedded IIOP endpoint has on the
          hash value. This allows the SSLIOP_Synthetic_Endpoint to hash
          just like an SSLIOP_Endpoint and makes possible that synthetic
          endpoints to be used to find previously cached transports.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp (idl_store_pragma):

          Added code to eat extra whitespace in a #pragma directive,
          need when using preprocessors that don't do it automatically.
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for
          discovering this quirk about the preprocessor used with the
          Intel C++ compiler. This fixes bugzilla bug [2110]

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_arg_traits.cpp (visit_operation):

          Added check for imported node, skipping code generation if the
          node is imported. For all other node types in this visitor, arg
          traits specializations must be generated, since an IDL type
          declared in an included file could be used as a parameter in
          an operation in the main file. But when visiting an operation
          itself, the only thing that triggers an arg traits specialization
          is an anonymous bounded string parameter (deprecated but still
          legal). Since this type of declaration is not visible outside
          the operation's scope, it should not trigger code generation
          if the node is imported. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for pointing out that this code generation
          for an imported operation causes a C++ compilation failure, due
          to the lack of a proper #include of tao/BD_String_Arg_Traits.h.

          On Windows, we use a configurator file to switch from the default
          reactor (TP) to Select MT.  The LoadManager, on Windows only,
          requires a reactor that supports registering signal handlers and
          the TP Reactor no longer supports that sort of thing.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/MT_Dispatching/run_test.pl:

          Committing a change from Dale Wilson <wilson_d@ociweb.com>.

          Change shut down timeout from hard coded 1 to symbolic 10
          to eliminate intermittent timeouts on various platforms.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/Structured_Multi_Filter/run_test.pl:

          Committing a change from Trevor Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com>.

          Added delay between iterations of the test to allow
          complete shutdown of Naming service.  The problem showed
          up on dual processor machines.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Notify/XML_Persistence/main.cpp:

          Added an include of the CosNotification library initializer header

          by the TMPDIR, TEMP and TMP environment variables.  This will work
          around NFS locking issues.
