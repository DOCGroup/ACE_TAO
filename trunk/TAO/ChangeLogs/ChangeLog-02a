	* orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Factory_Trader.cpp: Fixes for KAI that

	  round.

	* orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp:
	* orbsvcs//LifeCycle_Service/Factory_Trader.cpp:
	* orbsvcs/tests/Property/client.cpp: KAI needed fixes in these
	  files to compile clean. There was a need to explicitly use an
	  unsigned integer to avoid overloading amibiguity. Essentially
	  the same fix as 'Mon Jan 03 10:55:36 2000  David L. Levine'.

	* tao/ORB.h:
	* tao/corbafwd.h: Removed compiler-specific alignment adjusting
	  preprocessor directives for MSVC and BCB completely.  Thanks to
	  Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for reporting this.

        * orbsvcs/Time_Service/Clerk_i.cpp (get_first_IOR):
          explicitly use unsigned 0 index for bindings_list
          array element to avoid overloading ambiguity on Irix
          and HP/UX.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterators.cpp (next_n):
          modified look index so that its comparison is > 0, not
          >= 0.  Now that it's unsigned, it was causing a compiler
          warning.

Sun Jan 02 10:48:59 2000  Michael Kircher  <Michael.Kircher@mchp.siemens.de>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterators.cpp:
          Fixed a MSVC warning, complaining about an array
          operator.

Sat Jan 01 09:18:59 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: updated dependencies, including
          Notification Service files.

        * ChangeLog: moved to ChangeLog-99c.
