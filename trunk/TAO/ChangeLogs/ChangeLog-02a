	* tao/LF_Strategy.h:

	  No need to include "tao/orbconf.h."  Forward declaring
	  ACE_Time_Value is enough.

	* tao/orbconf.h:

	  Instead of "ace/OS.h", include "ace/config-all.h".  The latter
	  is all that is needed.  This change should improve compile times
	  since "config-all.h" does not include the large number of system
	  headers found in "OS.h," which provides for improved C++
	  preprocessing times in TAO.

	  (TAO_DEFAULT_ORB_TABLE_SIZE):

	  New constant that is used when setting the initial size of the
	  ORB table.  Previously a default of 1024 was used.  However,
	  most applications rarely use more than one ORB, meaning that
	  an ORB table size of 1024 is overkill.  The default is now 16.
	  This size should be more than adequate for the majority of
	  applications.

	  (MCAST_SERVICE_ID, NO_OF_MCAST_SERVICES):

	  Prepend "TAO_" to these macros to avoid polluting the global
	  namespace.

	* tao/ORB.h (resolve_service):
	* tao/ORB.cpp (resolve_service):
	* tao/params.h (service_port):
	* tao/params.i (service_port):
	* tao/params.cpp (TAO_ORB_Parameters):

	  Changed the parameter type "MCAST_SERVICEID" to
	  "TAO_MCAST_SERVICEID," in accordance with the changes made to
	  `orbconf.h' described above.

	* tao/ORB_Table.cpp (TAO_ORB_Table):

	  Initialize the underlying hash map (the ORB table) to a size of
	  TAO_DEFAULT_ORB_TABLE_SIZE.  This change reduces the default ORB
	  table size from 1024 to 16 (TAO_DEFAULT_ORB_TABLE_SIZE), thus
	  greatly reducing the initial ORB table memory utilization.

	* tao/IIOP_Connection_Handler.cpp (handle_input, handle_output):

	  No need to make a function call to retrieve the handle.  Just
	  use the handle parameter passed in to the method.

Sat Jan  5 15:04:46 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Fill_ACE_QoS.h:  Fix comments.

	* orbsvcs/performance-tests/EC_Federated_Scalability/Makefile:  
 	* orbsvcs/performance-tests/EC_Scalability/Makefile:
 	* orbsvcs/performance-tests/EC_Federated_Latency/Makefile:
 	* orbsvcs/performance-tests/EC_Latency/Makefile:

	  Only build these tests if RTEvent is set in TAO_ORBSVCS.

Fri Jan 4 17:30:21 2002  Jaiganesh Balasubramanian  <jai@kelvar.ece.uci.edu>

	* docs/tutorials/Quoter/RT_Event_Service/index.html:
	  Corrected some broken links. The errors were pointed out thanks
	  to Eric Peters <egpeters@u.washington.edu>.

Fri Jan  4 19:02:41 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-01c: A new file after splitting from this
	  one.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_decl.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_decl.h:

          Removed compute_repoID(), the version that is always 
          called in in the base class AST_Decl. Thanks to
          Brian Olson <bolson@rtlogic.com> for pointing out
          that the be_decl version was not doing the version
          part of the string correctly.

Fri Jan  4 16:30:04 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/DynamicAny/DynCommon.cpp (insert_reference):

          Since the argument is passed in as a CORBA::Object_ptr,
          and ultimately inserted into the member Any with the
          non-virtual operator <<=, then
          dyn_any->to_any()->type ()->id() would always yield
          "IDL:CORBA/Object:1.0", no matter what 
          dyn_any->type()->id() yields. So the insertion into
          the memeber Any has been changed to use _tao_replace(),
          and passing in the dyn_any's type code, which is 
          always of the derived type. Thanks to Mahesh Vedantam 
          <mahesh@ociweb.com> for reporting the problem.

Fri Jan  4 15:21:33 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/IFR_Service/ifr_visitor.cpp (visit_factory):

          Removed an unused argument.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_tmplinst.cpp:

          Removed explicit instantiation of ACE_Node<char *>, since
          it already appears in ACE.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:

          Changed isspace() to ACE_OS::ace_isspace().

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface_strategy.cpp (compute_coll_names):

          Changed a local const char[] to static const char*. The
          string  "POA_" is assigned to this constant, and there
          has been a long-standing intermittent problem with
          garbage being generated in place of the string. Although
          the problem has never been duplicated by the DOC Group,
          Sorin Iordachescu <sorin.iordachescu@am-beo.com> has
          produced it repeated and has suggested the above fix.

        * TAO_IDL/util/utl_err.cpp:

          Removed all use of ACE_TEXT from methods that return char*.
          When compilation is done with ACE_USES_WCHAR, the return
          type is incorrect. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen 
          <johnny_willemsen@planet.nl> for reporting the problem.

Fri Jan  4 14:32:43 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/Fill_QoS.h: Add #include <ace/OS_QoS.h>.

Thu Jan  3 07:18:22 2002  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/LifeCycle_Service.bor:
          Added library required for a statically linked build.

        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/NT_Notify_Service.bor:
        * orbsvcs/Notify_Service/Notify_Service.bor:
          Reverted the changes made to these files in
          Sun Dec 30 20:30:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
          as the trading library is required for a static build.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/*.bor:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Security.rc:
        * tao/*/Makefile.bor:
        * tao/*/*.rc:
          Added Borland makefile support for the new resource files.

Wed Jan  2 20:48:36 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@siesta.cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO-INSTALL.html: Fixed a couple of missing links.  Thanks to
	  Patrick Cosmo <Patrick@incognito.com> for reporting this.

Wed Jan  2 18:00:43 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp:

          Changed an instance of != ' ' to !isspace.

Wed Jan  2 15:57:52 2002  Priyanka Gontla  <pgontla@ece.uci.edu>

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Context_Interface.cpp (to_url): 
	  The to_url method should actually be returning a corbaname type
	  URL instead of the corbaloc style URL. According to the
	  INS specification, the method should return a fully formed URL
	  along with the key_string and corbaname format is the one that
	  can have the key_string in it.

	  Moved the pointer to the end of the dest string before
	  concatenating something to it. Previously, it was returning only
	  escaped key_string.

	* orbsvcs/tests/Interoperable_Naming/ncontextext_client_i.cpp :
	  Modified the string that is passed to the to_url method to have
	  a ':' before the dummy address. Now, its in one of the correct
	  syntaxes.
	
	  Thanks to Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com> for reporting all
	  these. 	

Wed Jan 02 15:25:53 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/ValueFactory.h: Removed the non-standard tao extension
	  repository_id().  According to the spec, for valuetypes without
	  a factory method, the developer supplied ValueFactory class
	  should inherit from CORBA::ValueFactoryBase directly.
	  Therefore, we can no longer generate this repository_id() method
	  in the IDL compiler.

	  Changed the TAO_OBV_REGISTER_FACTORY to take the type of
	  valuetype it handles as an extra parameter.  The macro will
	  simply use the non-standard TAO extension to stick in the
	  repository_id for the valuetype.  This may not be the correct
	  way to get the repository_id for a valuetype as it is not clear
	  to me how one can get it.

	* examples/OBV/Typed_Events/Event_Types_impl.h: Changed to inherit
	  valuetype factories from CORBA::ValueFactoryBase.

	* examples/OBV/Typed_Events/Server_i.cpp:
	* examples/OBV/Typed_Events/Client_i.cpp: Added type of valuetype
	  when registering factory with the TAO_OBV_REGISTER_FACTORY
	  macro.

Wed Jan  2 15:27:57 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_valuetype.cpp:

          Added some missing ACE_INLINEs to the _var and _out class
          method implementation code generation.

Wed Jan  2 12:02:35 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/fe/lex.yy.cpp (idl_valid_version):

          Had to add a check for trailing whitespace. SunCC's
          preprocessor leaves it in, it seems, and this was
          leading to version strings being falsely invalidated.

Wed Jan  2 10:22:59 2002  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typedef/typedef_ci.cpp (visit_array):

          Made changes that were overlooked in

          Fri Dec 28 15:41:18 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

          that correspond to changes made in typedef_ch.cpp.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_typedef/typedef_ch.cpp (visit_array):

          Cosmetic changes.

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.h:
	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/AV/AVStreams_i.cpp:
	  Remove dummy copy constructor, that should clear some of the
	  builds.
