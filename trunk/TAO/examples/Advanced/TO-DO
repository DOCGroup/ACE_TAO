This is a 'To Do' list for the TAO versions of the Henning and Vinoski
examples ($TAO_ROOT/examples/Advanced).   It is an ongoing effort to get
these examples working with TAO, 'out of the box' with as few changes as
possible.  If you'd like to help or have additional problems to report
please coordinate with Mike Moran <mm4@cs.wustl.edu>.

All changes which have been made over the original code distribution have
been documented in CHANGES files in each examples directory.  Please keep
these files up-to-date.

- Chapter 19's example throws exceptions at runtime.

- run_tests.pl in ch_3/, ch8_and_10/, ch_12/, and ch_21 do not work on Win32.
  These tests need to redirect stdout of the server to a file, and maintain a
  reference to the process so that the server can killed at the end of the
  script.

- Instances of fstream.close() and related error detection have been
  commented-out in all examples 12 and higher.  This code needs to be
  reinstated.

- Chapters 8 and above do not work with MS Visual Studio. possibly due to
  multiple inheritance issues.  Possibly STL issues, too.

- We could use a better test for the multitheraded server in ch_21.

- Do more testing on various platforms and compilers.  These so far only
  Solaris 7, Linux and Windows NT have been used.
