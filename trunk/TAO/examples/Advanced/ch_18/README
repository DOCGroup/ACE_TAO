Chapter 18 example
______________________________________________________________________________
This example been taken from the book "Advanced CORBA Programming with C++"
by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski. Copyright 1999. Addison-Wesley, Reading,
MA.  To make the examples work with TAO, some minor modifications to the
source code have been made, with permission, by Mike Moran <mm4@cs.wustl.edu>.
All of these changes are documented in the file CHANGES, in this directory.

Summary:
    This example adds the use of the Naming Service to the climate control
    system of chapter 12.

Building:
    This example must be built with native C++ exceptions, and with an ACE/TAO
    build with exceptions.  Make sure to use TAO_FLAG Ge=0 to ensure that the
    IDL generated code uses c++ exceptions rather than creating
    CORBA_Environment variables.

    With GNU make, simply type
     % make exceptions=1
    to create the executable server and client.

    Also, make sure that the Naming Service executable has been built at
    $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service.

server:
    The server takes no parameters nor command line options and registers the
    controller object with the naming service.  The server then waits
    infinitely for clients requests.

client:
    The client gets reference to the controller through the naming service,
    makes several remote calls on this controller, and terminates.

run_test.pl:
    The script starts up a new Naming Service, starts thc server and client,
    and when the client has completed terminates the server and NamingService.

Running:
    Please run the Naming Service first, then run the server program and
    finally run the client program.
