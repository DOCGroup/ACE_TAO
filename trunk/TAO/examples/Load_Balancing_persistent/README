This is an extension of the Load_Balancing_Service example in
$TAO_ROOT/examples/Load_Balancing. The aim of this example is to show
a methodology to preserve the state of the service.  Here, the service
stores the object reference of multiple copies of servers registered,
so that load can be balanced among the registered servers. If the load
balancing service fails, the references of the servers registered, is
read from the persistent storage and can be used to satisfy the
clients request. The core functionality is not much different from
that of the normal Load_Balancing_Service in
$TAO_ROOT/examples/Load_Balancing.

Usage:
-----
The service is started as follows

$./load_balancer -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:10016 -o filename

The server is started as follows

$./server -i file://filename -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:10007

and the client is started as follows

$./client -i file://filename [-r]

Now, the user can kill the service & restart the service. If the
client is restarted, everything should work fine as before.

PS:
The code contains some MACROS like DOORS_MEASURE_STATS. They have been
added for the performance measurements that were performed on this
application.
