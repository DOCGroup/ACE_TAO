This directory contains a number of example applications that
illustrate how to program with standard CORBA using TAO.  The
individual directories contain READMEs on how to run the following
examples:

        . POA

          Contains various small examples of POA features based on
          the OMG POA specification.

        . Quoter
        
          Illustrates how to use the Global POA options with multiple
          threads.  This example also shows how to use the Lifecycle
          service. 
                      
        . Simple
          
          Contains a number of very simple examples, which also
          illustrate how to write canonical Orbix/VisiBroker/OmniORB
          examples in TAO using standard CORBA features rather than
          proprietary ORB features.
