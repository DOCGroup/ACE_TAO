This document describes the standard CORBA location forwarding
example.  For detailed explanation on how TAO's location forwarding
feature is designed, see

$TAO_ROOT/docs/forwarding.html

The test in this directory sets up three servers, the first writes its
servant's object reference (IOR) to a file.  The second server reads
the IOR, recognizes it as forwarding location, and writes its own to a
file too.  The third server does the same as the second server.  The
third server's IOR is then read by the client, which then issues a
number of requests.  After <iterations> normal requests, a forwarding
request is sent to the object.

Here's an example for 5 requests:

doit() returned 127
doit() returned 128
doit() returned 129
Asking server to forward next time
doit() returned 127
doit() returned 128
doit() returned 129
Asking server to forward next time
doit() returned 127
doit() returned 128
doit() returned 129

The location forwarding is implemented through the servant activator.
Check run_test.pl for an example of how to run the server.

The first three calls will be called on the first server, then the
location forwarding is called and the next three calls are going to be
called on the second server.  Location forwarding is then called on
the second one and the last three calls are then done on the thrid
server.
