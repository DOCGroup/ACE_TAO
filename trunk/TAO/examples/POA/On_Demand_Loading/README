On_Demand_Loading Example
-------------------------

This example deals with dynamically loading servants in a POA.

A POA configured with the USE_SERVANT_MANAGER policy value relies on
an application supplied Servant Manager object to supply object/server
associations. If the POA has the RETAIN value for the servant
retention, the POA expects the Servant Manager to supply the Servant
Activator interface.

In this example, the Servant Activator interface is used.
The servant is an dynamically linkable library Dir_Service.
This is an servant which provides directory assistance.

The client asks for directory assistance and at the server end the
Servant Actiavtor loads the dynamic linkable library on demand,
obtains the servant object which then answers the client's request.

Note that the server need not be built with the library. The library
name and the factory method which will be used to obtain the servant
is known to the server only at runtime. This gives us the flexibility
of modifying and loading the servant without having to build the
server along with the library.

Execution:
---------

There are two process:

1. Server -- which will handle any requests for directory assistance.
2. client -- needs the directory assistance.

So run the server first and then the client process.

example:
        
      >  server -f ior_file 
                The ior_file is a file which stores the IOR, that is
        the object reference of the server which identifies it in the endsystem.


      > client -f ior_file -x
                The server IOR is read by the client so that the
        request can be targetted to the server. The -x option shuts down the
        server when its request is answered.

        On giving the -o option, the area codes are displayed as part
        of a oneway directory service.
