This directory contains a number of example applications that
illustrate how to transmit large files using standard CORBA and TAO.
The individual directories contain READMEs on how to run the following
examples:

        . SMI_Iterator

          Illustrates how to use the Iterator pattern to download
          large files one chunk at a time using synchronous
          method invocations that are "pulled" by the client
          from the server.

        . AMI_Iterator

          Illustrates how to use the Iterator pattern to download
          large files one chunk at a time using asynchronous
          method invocations that are "pulled" by the client
          from the server.

        . AMI_Observer

          Illustrates how to use the Observer pattern to download
          large files one chunk at a time using asynchronous
          method invocations that are "pushed" from the server
          to the client.
