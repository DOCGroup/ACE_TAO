This is a simple chat application that uses the TAO CORBA ORB.
It consists of a client and server programs.

The server broadcasts messages from one client to all the clients registered with it.

The client(s) register with a running server. It has a very simple user interface that accepts strings from the user and sends it across to the server.
The client code also demonstrates the use of the ACE_Event_Handlerclass to accept user input events.

server:
-------

server [-o <ior_output_file>]

Options:
-------
-o    Outputs the server ior to the file specified.

On successfull initialization, the server displays a message that it is running and waits for clients to register with it.

if the [-o <ior_output_file>] option is not specified on the command line then the the server will write the IOR of the server CORBA object to a default file - "chat.ior".

client:
-------

client [-n <your_nick_name> -f <ior_input_file>]

Options:
-------
-n    The nickname that the chat user wants to use.
-f    Reads the server ior from the file

The nickname specified by the user is displayed by the chat server to all the clients.
To quit the chat, type "quit".

if the [-f <ior_input_file>] option is not specified on the command line then the client will attempt to read the IOR of the server CORBA object from the default file - "chat.ior".
