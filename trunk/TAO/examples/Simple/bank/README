This is a simple CORBA example that has a module Bank with two
interfaces Account and AccountManager.  The Account interface has a
method to return the balance in that account.  The AccountManager
interface has a method to create a new Account and return the IOR of
this to the client.  The two interfaces also have methods to shutdown
the server.

server:
-------

server [-d]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag (It is additive more -d flags will give debugging).

When the server is started, you should see as the first line of output
something that looks like
	iiop:1.0//danzon.cs.wustl.edu:10015/P35ad159600081a38/child_poa/server
	(-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
	(-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  This option is additive, i.e.,
the more -d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the
moment, only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d
options are ignored.

client:
-------

client [-d] [-x] [-n iterations] [-b initial_balance] [-o Name_of_account_holder]
       [-f IOR_file_name ] [-k IOR]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag
-x    Tells the server to shutdown at the end of the test.
-n    no. of iterations
-b    initial balance
-o    Name of the Account Holder
-k    Read IOR from the command line
-f    Read IOR from the specified file
