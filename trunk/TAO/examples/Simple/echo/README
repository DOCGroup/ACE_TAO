This is a simple CORBA example that has an object (Echo) with only two
methods, one that returns the message to be displayed and another that
shuts down the server.

server:
-------

server [-d] [-o <ior_output_file>] [-s]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag (It is additive more -d flags will give debugging).
-o    Outputs the ior to the file
      The ior is the reference using which the client can interact with
      the target server object.
-s    Use the naming service

When the server is started, you should see as the first line of output
something that looks like

	iiop:1.0//danzon.cs.wustl.edu:10015/P35ad159600081a38/child_poa/server
	(-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
	(-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  This option is additive, i.e.,
the more -d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the
moment, only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d
options are ignored.

client:
-------

client [-d] [-x] [-f <Server_ior_file>] [-n iterations] [-k ior] [-s]

Options:
-------
-d    Debug flag
-x    Tells the server to shutdown at the end of the test.
-f    Reads the server ior from the file
-n    no. of iterations
-k    IOR or The IOR can also be given in the format like file://[file.ior]
      with the full path

-s    Use the naming service

You can either cut and paste the IOR from the server to the client
(with the -k option), have the client read the IOR from a file using
the -f option (this file is produced using the -o option of the
server), or use the naming service (with the -s option).

run_test.pl:
------------

This perl script runs the server and client and shuts down the server
when it is done.
