This directory contains a CORBA example illustrating a simple client and
a server with an interface Messenger. The Messenger interface has
an operation for sending a message (send_message).  The MessengerClient
will send a message which is displayed by the MessengerServer when
received.  The MessengerClient will then confirm that the message has
been sent successfully.

This version of the MessengerServer illustrates the single-threaded
reactive concurrency model for servers as described in the
Multithreading with TAO chapter.  The svc.conf file shows run time
configuration options for optimizing single-threaded TAO applications.


How to Run
----------

To start the server :
------------------
./MessengerServer


To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient



Exeuction via Perl Script
-------------------------

A Perl script has been created to automate the steps shown
above.  This script can be run via the following command:

./run_test.pl


NOTE:

   If you run on Windows platform, go to Debug or Release directory to run the
   script via following command:

   perl ../run_test.pl
