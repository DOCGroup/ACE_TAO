This directory contains a CORBA example illustrating a simple client and
a server with a Interface Messenger. The Messenger Interface has
an operation for sending a message (send_message).  The MessengerClient
will send a message which is displayed by the MessengerServer when
received.  The MessengerClient will then confirm that the message has
been sent successfully.

This version of the example has been modified to use a new ValueType called
Message that encapsulates the message information. The send method on
Messenger has been modified to take a single Message inout parameter.


How to Run
----------

Start the server :
------------------
./server


Start the client:
------------------
./client



Exeuction via Perl Script
