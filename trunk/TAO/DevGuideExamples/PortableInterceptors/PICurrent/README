Portable Interceptors


File: DevGuideExamples/PortableInterceptor/PICurrent_NameService/README


This directory contains an example that shows how the PICurrent can
be used to stop client-side interceptor recursions.

This example is based on the Messenger example in GettingStarted
directory.  A message is send by MessengerClient and displayed by
MessengerServer.  When the client receives a reply, it asks the server
for the current time. This causes a recursive call at the receive_reply()
interception point. A flag is passed in the PICurrent to let the client
know the call is recursive.

How to Run
----------

To start the server:
------------------
./MessengerServer

To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient -ORBInitRef Messenger=file://Messenger.ior

Execuction via Perl Script
-------------------------

A Perl script has been created to automate the steps shown
above.  This script can be run via the following command:

./run_test.pl
