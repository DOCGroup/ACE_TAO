This example is a copy of the $TAO_ROOT/test/BiDirerectional test
but it does not use ACE_TRY/ENVIRONMENT macros.

This example exercises the birectional GIOP connection
implementation in TAO.

Start like this:

$ server -o <file.ior> -i <no_iterations>
$ client -k file://<file.ior>

The server starts up writing the IOR to the file. The client then
starts up, creates its own object and passes the reference to the
server. Then it invokes a method on the server to indicate that it is
ready for callback. The server then callsback the client on the same
connection <no_iterations> times. If the server creates a new
connection the server will crash itself.

Each time the client recieves a callback, it outputs:
Callback method called.
