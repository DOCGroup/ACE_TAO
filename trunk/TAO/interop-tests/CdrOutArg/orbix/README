This is the Orbix companion for the CDR OUT Arg test. In order to build, you must
have Orbix 6.2 installed on your system. Local editing of the supplied makefiles
may be required. The DOC group cannot support this code as it does not havve the
licenses to do so.

After building, run the server with no arguments, the IOR will be written to the
file ./test.ior. Provide that to the TAO client. A successful test will exit with
no error, a failure will yield a MARSHAL exception.
