Wed Dec 03 09:27:44 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

	* local/bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp: added
          ACE_Atomic_Op<ACE_ES_MUTEX, int> template instantiation.

Tue Dec  2 10:32:01 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* local/bin/Event_Service/Makefile:
	* local/bin/Event_Service/Dispatching_Modules.h:
	* local/bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp:
	* local/bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.h:
	* local/bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.i:
	* local/bin/Event_Service/RT_Task.cpp:
	* local/bin/Event_Service/RT_Task.h:
	  The ACE_TIMEPROBE implementation was moved into the orbsvcs
	  library.
	  Added some more ACE_TIMEPROBE to the point were all the lifetime
	  of an event seems to every message
	  seems
	  Removed some forwarding info leftovers on the Event Channel
	  implementation.

	* local/tests/Latency.cpp:
	  Added some ACE_TIMEPROBE calls to measure delays.
	  Use the double field to timestamp the event, using a
	  highrestimer (TOTAL HACK).

Sun Nov 30 16:57:40 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/Event_Service/Makefile:
	  Added the old probe=X flag to include/exclude ACE_TIMEPROBE code.

	* bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.i:
	* bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp:
	* bin/Event_Service/Dispatching_Modules.i:
	* bin/Event_Service/Dispatching_Modules.cpp:
	  Normalized ACE_TIMEPROBE messages, all start with two spaces,
	  but the timeout, which starts a loop, IMHO is easier to read
	  that way.

	* bin/Scheduling_Service/dump_schedule.cpp:
	* bin/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
	  g++ does not seems to cast _var types to _ptr parameters on its
	  own, an explicit call to the ptr() method seems needed.

	* tests/Latency.h:
	  Removed virtual methods from Latency_Supplier, thanks to g++ for
	  noticing that those were uneeded.

	* bin/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
	* bin/Scheduling_Service/dump_schedule.cpp:
	* bin/Scheduling_Service/schedule_service.cpp:
	* tests/Latency.cpp:
	  The Naming Service has been working for quite a bit now, we use
	  it instead of the ad-hoc ORBcore flags.

	* tests/Latency.cpp:
	  Use the high resolution timer to measure round-trip delays, and
	  keep most of the original code for it. But we are not using the
	  time_ field on the events (yet); a global variable takes its
	  place.


Mon Nov 24 20:53:03 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.h:
	* bin/Event_Service/Event_Channel.cpp:
	  Removed the forward_event support, since this is MDA/Boeing
	  propietary.

Thu Nov 20 22:07:36 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * local/bin/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler_Generic.*:
          added ACE_Scheduler_Generic.  It's a drop-in
          replacement for ACE_Scheduler_Internal that assigns
          the same priority and subpriority to all tasks.

Wed Nov 19 14:53:25 1997  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * local/bin/Scheduling_Service/Scheduler.cpp: #include
          Scheduler.h instead of Scheduler_Internal.h.
          (export): changed loop index from u_int to int to avoid
          signed/unsigned comparison.

Tue Nov 18 13:26:32 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Latency.cpp:
	  Added minimal code to measure round trip delays through the EC.

Mon Nov 17 18:44:29 1997  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Latency.h:
	* tests/Latency.cpp:
	  Added small classes to implement the Supplier and Consumer
	  personalities of Latency_Supplier; they delegate on it to do the
	  job.
	  The QoS for the Consumer personality of Latency_Supplier was
	  wrong.
