// utl_strlist.cc
//
// Implementation of a list of utl_string nodes

// NOTE: This list class only works correctly because we use single public
//       inheritance, as opposed to multiple inheritance or public virtual.
//	 It relies on a type-unsafe cast from UTL_List to subclasses, which
//	 will cease to operate correctly if you use either multiple or
//	 public virtual inheritance.
//
//	 For portability reasons we have decided to provide both this and
//	 an implementation of the list classes in terms of templates. If
//	 your compiler supports templates, please use the files in the
//	 include/utl_tmpl and util/utl_tmpl directories instead of the
//	 files by the same names in the include and util directories.
