	* tao/Pluggable_Messaging.h:
	* tao/GIOP_Message_Base.h:
	* tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp:
	* tao/Transport.cpp:
	* tao/Transport.h:
	* tao/Transport.inl: Added support for GIOP fragments. The GIOP
	  fragmentation supportseems to have some copying and allocation
	  overhead. Need to look into this when it gets
	  important. Further, the fragmentatiojn support hasnt been
	  tested at all as we have no way of testing it.

	* tao/IIOP_Transport.cpp: Enabled GIOP lite support
	* tao/TAO.dsp: Added GIOP lite files back to the builds.

	* tao/Connection_Handler.h:
	* tao/orbconf.h: Moved some of the #defines from
          Connection_Handler.h to orbconf.h.

	* tao/GIOP_Message_Generator_Parser_12.cpp: The long talked about
	  alignment for the LocateReply messages have been removed. We
	  dont align the messages on an 8 byte boundary as described by
	  the CORBA 2.4 spec. This is one of the urgent resolutions
	  adopted by the OMG.

	* tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.h:
	* tao/GIOP_Message_Lite.cpp: Added support for GIOP lite. The
	  implementation now  is similar to the regular GIOP.

	* tao/GIOP_Message_Base.cpp: Used the payload_size () in
	  GIOP_Message_State  for claculating the payload. We were using
	  the message_size () and then subtracting the length of the GIOP
	  header in consolidate_node (). This looked cumbersome.
