<h4><strong><a name="makenotes">A Note On Make</a></strong></h4>

Since TAO is built atop ACE, TAO re-uses ACE's Makefile structure as
well.  Thus, just like ACE requires GNU Make, so too does TAO.  More
exactly, versions of <code>make</code> which are known to <em>not</em>
work include those from Solaris 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX, the latest BSD,
etc.<p>

GNU Make can be obtained from various places in source form.<P>


<HR><P>
<h3>For Cross-Compiled Targets, such as VxWorks and LynxOS</h3>

If you are building TAO for a VxWorks target, please see the detailed
instructions for building and installing ACE and TAO in <a
href="../ACE-INSTALL.html#vxworks">$ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html</a>.<p>

    <P>Cross-compiling TAO is not much different than building it for
      self-host.  The one major difference is that TAO's IDL compiler
      must be built and run on the host; it's not necessary to run it
      on the target.
      There are several ways to do this, below we document the two
      most common approaches:
      </P>

    <H4>Modifying the default location for the IDL compiler</H4>

    <P>By default TAO assumes that the IDL compiler is located in:
      <CODE>$TAO_ROOT/TAO_IDL/tao_idl</CODE> and that the GPERF tool
      is located in <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/bin/gperf</CODE>, this is fine for
      hosted builds, but not for cross-compilation.
      Unfortunately there is no good default for cross-compilation
      builds because different sites choose a different location for
      their tools.
    </P>
    <P>You can override the default values by adding two lines in your
      platform_macros.GNU file, as follows:
<PRE>
$ echo 'TAO_IDL := /your/path/tao_idl' \
     >> platform_macros.GNU
$ echo 'TAO_IDLFLAGS := -g /your/path/gperf' \
</PRE>
    </P>
    <P>You could even use:
<PRE>
$ echo 'TAO_IDL := tao_idl' \
     >> platform_macros.GNU
$ echo 'TAO_IDLFLAGS := -g gperf' \
</PRE>
    if the tools are in your path.
    </P>

    <P>Obviously you must first build the tools for the host platform,
      typically you would do this as follows:
<PRE>
# (1) Create a clone directory for the host:

$ cd ACE_wrappers
$ mkdir -p build/HOST
$ ./bin/create_ace_build build/HOST

# (2) Configure the host build:

$ echo '#include "ace/config-HOST.h"' > build/HOST/ace/config.h
$ echo 'include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_HOST.GNU' \
     > build/HOST/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

# Often host builds are static:
$ echo 'static_libs_only=1' \
     >> build/HOST/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

# (3) Build the host tools

$ cd build/HOST
$ export ACE_ROOT=$PWD
$ make -C ace
$ make -C apps/gperf
$ make -C TAO/TAO_IDL
</PRE>

    <P>Then configuring the location of the tools for the target
      could be done as shown here:
<PRE>
# (4) Create a clone directory for the target:

$ cd ACE_wrappers
$ mkdir -p build/TARGET
$ ./bin/create_ace_build build/TARGET

# (5) Configure the target build:

$ echo '#include "ace/config-TARGET.h"' > build/HOST/ace/config.h
$ echo 'include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_TARGET.GNU' \
     > build/TARGET/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

# (6) Configure the TARGET build to use the HOST IDL compiler and
#     gperf tools, as described above.
</PRE>

    <H4>Alternative configuration, using links</H4>

    <P>Some developers prefer to set up the host tools using symbolic
      links (Unix) or copy of <code>tao_idl</code> (NT).
      By way of example, here is how you could setup a
      croos-compilation environment for Unix,
      the host is <CODE>SunOS5/g++</CODE>,
      the target is <CODE>VxWorks</CODE>.
      It assumes that the ACE+TAO distribution has been
      unpacked, with TAO below ACE_wrappers.  It uses the
      ACE_wrappers/bin/create_ace_build script to create a shadow
      build
      tree:
<ol>
  <li><code>cd ACE_wrappers</code>
  <li><code>bin/create_ace_build SunOS5_g++</code>
  <li><code>bin/create_ace_build vxworks</code>
  <li><code>cd build/vxworks/TAO</code>
  <li><code>/bin/rm -r TAO_IDL</code>
  <li><code>ln -s ../../SunOS5_g++/TAO/TAO_IDL</code>
</ol>
  </P>

      <P>To build on the host:
<ol>
  <li><code>cd build/SunOS5_g++</code>
  <li><code>export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`;
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
  <li><code>(cd ace; make && cd ../tests; make && cd ../TAO; make) &gt;
    make.log</code>
  <li><code>cd ../vxworks</code>
  <li><code>export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`</code>
  <li><code>(cd ace; make && cd ../tests; make && cd ../TAO; make) &gt;
    make.log</code>
</ol></p>

    <P>For NT hosts, please see the detailed instructions for building
      and installing ACE and TAO in
      <a href="../ACE-INSTALL.html#vxworks">../ACE-INSTALL.html</a>,
      and
      <a href="../ACE-INSTALL.html#VxWorks/NT">Building ACE on
	Tornado/NT hosts for VxWorks targets</a>
    </P>

    <P>Please note that dynamic loading of libraries is not supported
      by TAO for any cross-compiled target.  Therefore, dynamic
      service configuration of the TAO ORB is not supported.
    </p>

    <P>If using perfect hashing, TAO_IDL needs gperf to be built on
      the host. That's the default on many platforms.  First, build
      <code>gperf</code> in the
      <code>ACE_wrappers/apps/gperf/src/</code> directory.  Then, add
      a symlink or copy to the <code>bin/</code> directory for the
      target.
    </P>

    <H4>Which one is right for me?</H4>

    <P>Using links to cross-compile TAO may appear simpler at first
      glance.  However, storing the location in the
      <CODE>platform_macros.GNU</CODE> is more amenable for
      sites where many developers share the same configuration files,
      or where ACE+TAO are compiled once and used by a medium or large
      size group.
    </P>

<HR><P>
<H3>On Windows NT and Windows 2000 and Windows XP</H3>

<P><CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> does not contain its own preprocessor, so it
needs to use an external preprocessor.  Depending on which compiler was
used to build <CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE>, the default preprocessor will change.
For example, if compiled with MSVC, <CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> will look for
CL.EXE in the path. There are cases where this will not work, such as in cross-compiling
or if the preprocessor is not in the path.  These situations require that
environment variables are set on the machine to override the
built-in settings.  More information about these environment variables can
be found in the <a href="docs/compiler.html#idl_env">TAO_IDL documentation.</a></P>

<P>It is also advisable to set either the <CODE>ACE_ROOT</CODE> environment
variable as outlined in the
<a href="../ACE-INSTALL.html">ACE
installation notes</A> or the <code>TAO_ROOT</code> environment variable.
This is only required if you are planning to use the &lt;orb.idl&gt;
standard include in your IDL code.  Notice that some of the TAO services
use this feature, so you are better off definining the environment variable
in all cases.  </P>

Remember to <a href="../ACE-INSTALL.html">set
up ACE</A> before building TAO.

<H4>Visual C++ 5.0/6.0</H4>

<P>It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
<CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> because the Visual C++ 5/6 Project files
are set up to work in this configuration. If you move it, then make
sure you change the project files to look for the include and library
files in the correct place.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 5.0/6.0, use ace.dsw). <P>

  <LI>First make sure <CODE>ACE_wrappers\bin</CODE> is listed in the Executable
      Directories in Tools|Options.  This is needed if using the TAO_IDL
      compiler under MSVC.  If you intend to also use the release version of the
          libraries, also add <CODE>ACE_wrappers\bin\Release</CODE> to the directories.
          <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The order that these are listed is important.  If your
          main development is with the debug versions, make sure \bin is before
          \bin\Release, otherwise put the \bin\Release first.  Because the output names
          for the release and debug versions of TAO_IDL are the same, extra care must be
          taken when both versions are generated simulataneously. <P>

  <LI>Load the workspace <CODE>tao\TAO.dsw</CODE> and build the TAO
      library. <P>

  <LI>To build the Cubit test, load the workspace
      <CODE>performance-tests\Cubit\TAO\IDL_Cubit\IDL_Cubit.dsw</CODE>
      and build both client and server. <P>
</OL>

<H4><A NAME="taoace">TAOACE.dsw and other collection dsw files</A></H4>

<P>TAOACE.dsw is a Visual C++ 5.0/6.0 workspace that loads the projects
ACE, TAO, TAO_IDL (the compiler), gperf, the orb services libraries, and
the standalone executables (such as Naming Service, etc.).  It can be
used to build all the files needed to build/run TAO applications.</P>

<H4>Borland C++ Builder</H4> <P>

To build TAO using C++Builder please follow the
<A HREF="../ACE-INSTALL.html#borland">ACE installation notes</A>, with the
difference being that you should run:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
make -f Makefile.bor
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
from the $ACE_ROOT\TAO directory instead of $ACE_ROOT\ace.<P>

For more detailed information on building and using TAO with Borland's
C++ Builder environment, please see the <A
HREF="http://www.tenermerx.com/tao_bcb/index.html">online</A> help
provided by <A HREF="mailto:chris@kohlhoff.com">Christopher
Kohlhoff</A>. <P>

<H4>Upgrading From Older Releases</H4>

<P>When a newer version of ACE/TAO is installed, rebuild all should be
used to make sure everything is built correctly.</P>

<H4>Changing Include Paths</H4>

<P>If you prefer <code>#include &lt;corba.h&gt;</code> over <code> #include
&lt;tao/corba.h&gt;</code> then you will need to change your Project Settings
to also contain the <code>TAO/tao</code> directory.  You'll find this in the
C/C++ settings under Input.</P>

<H4>Creating Static Libraries (*.lib)</H4>

<P>TAO, orbsvcs, TAO_IDL, and the Simple Test all have extra project files
for static library builds.  TAOACE_static.dsw contains some of these projects,
and is set up much like <A HREF="#taoace">TAOACE.dsw</A>, except that there
are not as many static projects as their are dynamic projects and their
isn't the same dependencies set up.</P>

<P> To use the static libraries in a project, make sure to the following
settings are used in the Project Settings.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><strong>C/C++ | General:</strong> Add the Preprocessor Definitions
      <CODE>ACE_HAS_DLL=0</CODE>, <CODE>ACE_OS_HAS_DLL=0</CODE> and whatever
	  other libraries that are included (such as <CODE>TAO_HAS_DLL=0</CODE>)
  <LI><strong>Link:</strong> Link with the static libs, such as
      TAOs.lib or TAOsd.lib
</UL>

<H4>MinGW and Cygwin</H4> <P>

<P>First, follow the build instructions in the
<A HREF="../ACE-INSTALL.html#mingw">ACE installation notes.</A>
When building with MinGW and Cygwin you are using the GNU make under Windows.
When you use make from the commandline, make sure that <code>TAO_ROOT</code> is 
set to a full path or to <code>%ACE_ROOT%/TAO</code>, which will also result
in setting a full path. Setting it with the Unix style to <code>$ACE_ROOT/TAO</code>
will not work, setting it using the make style to <code>$(ACE_ROOT)/TAO</code> looks
to work but will cause problems when building the TAO services, so don't do that.
The correct way is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>set TAO_ROOT=%ACE_ROOT%/TAO</code></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<H3>Perl Scripts</H3>

<P>Several of TAO's tests and examples contain perl scripts that automate the
execution of these tests. The scripts are found as "run_test.pl" in the
directory of the test.</p>

<P> The versions of perl that we use are 5.005_02 on NT and 5.003 on Solaris.
The scripts may work on earlier versions of perl, but we cannot say for sure
that they do.</P>

<HR>
<H3>Native Exceptions</H3>

<P>TAO will use native exceptions if TAO_HAS_EXCEPTIONS is defined when it is
compiled. This can be accomplished in two ways: by defining ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS
in the config.h or config-*.h files (such as on Windows) or by using
<CODE>make exceptions=1</CODE> when you compile TAO.</P>

<P>Take note though, that this only enables support in ACE/TAO, the correct
compiler flags must also be given to the compiler to enable them.</P>

<HR>
<P>

<H3>minimumTAO</H3>

<P>By default, all components in TAO will be compiled.  If you only
want support for <A HREF="../docs/minimumTAO.html">minimumTAO</A>, define
TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA. This can be accomplished in two ways: by
defining TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA in the config.h or orbconf.h files or
by using <CODE>make minimum_corba=1</CODE> when you compile TAO.</P>

<strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">WARNING:</font></blink></strong>
Make sure that if you build liborbsvcs with minimum_corba=1 you also
build libTAO with minimum_corba=1!<P>

<HR>
<P>

<H3>Connection Caching feature</H3>

<p>By default, TAO includes the connection caching and purging feature
   which reuses "old" connections by purging them according to the
   caching strategy opted for (Least Recently Used, Least Frequently
   Used, First In First Out). This way socket descriptors are reused
   thereby increasing scalability.<p>

   This feature can be controlled by defining or commenting out
   TAO_USES_ROBUST_CONNECTION_MGMT in $TAO_ROOT/tao/orbconf.h.<p>

   But the code related to this feature consists of classes with large
   template lists and can cause problems with linkers and assemblers
   which cant grok long names.<p>

   Tips:<p>

   Check on SunOS5.6 (and above) whether the assembler used is of the Sun
   Workshop 5 version else you could get linker errors due to huge
   symbols.<p>

   If using egcs2.95 as the compiler the <code>-fsquangle</code>
   option could be used which shortens the symbol names.
   Thanks to <a href="mailto:ssweeney@sanders.com">Skye Sweeney</a>
   for trying it out and <a href="mailto:othman@cs.wustl.edu">Ossama
   Othman</a> for discovering the option with egcs. Note: Both the ACE
   library and TAO library need to built using this option.</p>
