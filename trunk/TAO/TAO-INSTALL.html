via the WWW and ftp.  <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/TAO">TAO</A> is bundled
with the <A

<h3><strong><a name="sun_g++_notes">Note About g++ On
Solaris for x86 Target</a></strong></h3>

If you install g++/gcc from <a href="http://www.blastwave.org"> blastwave
</a> then this note is applicable for you. If you are in the habit of
building g++/gcc from sources directly, please feel free to skip this
section. <p>

The distribution from <a href="http://www.blastwave.org">blastwave</a> has,
as we believe, a bug in it. This bug manifests as compilation errors
when you try to build the orbsvcs when debugging is enabled. Please
remember that debugging is enabled in your platform_macros.GNU if you
haven't specifically disabled it. The easiest way to address this
issue is to set debug=0 in platform_macros.GNu file or build a g++
compiler for your target platform. A bug has been registered with
blastwave. If you have more questions please feel to contact <a
mailto="bala at dre.vanderbilt.edu"> Bala Natarajan </a>.

<h2><strong><a name="makenotes">A Note On Make</a></strong></h2>

Since TAO is built atop ACE, TAO re-uses ACE's Makefile structure as
well.  Thus, just like ACE requires GNU Make, so too does TAO.  More
exactly, versions of <code>make</code> which are known to <em>not</em>
work include those from Solaris 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX, the latest BSD,
etc.<p>

GNU Make can be obtained from various places in source and binary
form. Please see <a href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html">ACE-INSTALL.html</a>
for details from where they can be obtained.<P>

<HR><P>
<h3>Using cross compilation</h3>

With cross compilation you build on the so called host system for a certain
target system. The host system can for example be linux and the target
can for example be VxWorks, LynxOS, or Linux.

If you are building TAO for a VxWorks target, please see the detailed
instructions for building and installing ACE and TAO in <a
href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#vxworks">$ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html</a>.</p>
<p>If you are building TAO for an Android target, please see the notes
for building and installing ACE and TAO in <a
href="../ACE-INSTALL.html#android">$ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html</a>.</p>

    <P>Cross-compiling TAO is not much different than building it for a
      self-host.  The one major difference is that TAO's IDL compiler
      must be built and run on the host; it's not necessary to run it
      on the target.
      There are several ways to do this, below we document the two
      most common approaches:
      </P>

    <H4>Modifying the default location for the IDL compiler</H4>

    <P>By default TAO assumes that the IDL compiler is located in:
      <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/bin/tao_idl</CODE> and that the GPERF tool
      is located in <CODE>$ACE_ROOT/bin/gperf</CODE>, this is fine for
      hosted builds, but not for cross-compilation.
      Unfortunately there is no good default for cross-compilation
      builds because different sites choose a different location for
      their tools.
    </P>
    <P>
      The location of the IDL compiler is set when the makefiles (whether
      GNU, Visual Studio projects, or any other type) are generated using
      MPC. If you are using GNU make for the target build, you can follow the
      procedure below with no further steps. If, however, you are using
      Visual Studio for the target build, you must generate the Visual Studio
      projects with a specification of where the hosted IDL compiler is. One
      common way to do this is to use the MPC <code>-value_template</code>
      option to specify the path to the IDL compiler, either using a
      fully specified path or an environment variable. For example, to specify
      the location with the <code>HOST_TAO_IDL</code> environment variable,
      generate your projects with the MPC command line option
      <code>-value_template tao_idl=$(HOST_TAO_IDL)</code>. Then before
      running Visual Studio to cross-build for the target, be sure that the
      <code>HOST_TAO_IDL</code> environment variable is set to the location
      of the host-built IDL compiler. Note that if the host-built IDL compiler
      requires a PATH setting different from what's set in the Visual Studio
      environment, you must set the PATH environment variable and specify the
      <code>/USEENV</code> option to devenv.
    </P>
    <P>If your builds are using GNU make, you can override the default values
      by adding several lines to your <code>platform_macros.GNU</code> file.
      Assuming $(HOST_ROOT) is set to the location of your host build where
      you previously built gperf and tao_idl, you can change the target
      build by adding the following lines:
<PRE>
TAO_IDL := $(HOST_ROOT)/bin/tao_idl
TAO_IDLFLAGS += -g $(HOST_ROOT)/bin/gperf
TAO_IDL_DEP := $(HOST_ROOT)/bin/tao_idl$(EXEEXT)
</PRE>

    <P>Obviously you must first build the tools for the host platform,
      typically you would do this as follows:
<PRE>
# (1) Create a clone directory for the host:

$ cd ACE_wrappers
$ mkdir -p build/HOST
$ ./bin/create_ace_build build/HOST

# (2) Configure the host build:

$ echo '#include "ace/config-HOST.h"' > build/HOST/ace/config.h
$ echo 'include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_HOST.GNU' \
     > build/HOST/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

# Often host builds are static:
$ echo 'static_libs_only=1' \
     >> build/HOST/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

# (3) Build the host tools

$ cd build/HOST
$ export ACE_ROOT=$PWD
$ make -C ace
$ make -C apps/gperf/src
$ make -C TAO/TAO_IDL
</PRE>

    <P>Then configuring the location of the tools for the target
      could be done as shown here:
<PRE>
# (4) Create a clone directory for the target:

$ cd ACE_wrappers
$ mkdir -p build/TARGET
$ ./bin/create_ace_build build/TARGET

# (5) Configure the target build:

$ echo '#include "ace/config-TARGET.h"' > build/HOST/ace/config.h
$ echo 'include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_TARGET.GNU' \
     > build/TARGET/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU

# (6) Configure the TARGET build to use the HOST IDL compiler and
#     gperf tools, as described above.
</PRE>

    <H4>Alternative configuration, using links</H4>

    <P>Some developers prefer to set up the host tools using symbolic
      links (Unix) or copy of <code>tao_idl</code> (NT).
      By way of example, here is how you could setup a
      croos-compilation environment for Unix,
      the host is <CODE>SunOS5/g++</CODE>,
      the target is <CODE>VxWorks</CODE>.
      It assumes that the ACE+TAO distribution has been
      unpacked, with TAO below ACE_wrappers.  It uses the
      ACE_wrappers/bin/create_ace_build script to create a shadow
      build
      tree:
<ol>
  <li><code>cd ACE_wrappers</code>
  <li><code>bin/create_ace_build SunOS5_g++</code>
  <li><code>bin/create_ace_build vxworks</code>
  <li><code>cd build/vxworks/bin</code>
  <li><code>/bin/rm -r tao_idl</code>
  <li><code>ln -s ../../SunOS5_g++/bin/tao_idl</code>
</ol>

      <P>To build on the host:
<ol>
  <li><code>cd build/SunOS5_g++</code>
  <li><code>export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`;
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/ace:`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
  <li><code>(cd ace; make && cd ../tests; make && cd ../TAO; make) &gt;
    make.log</code>
  <li><code>cd ../vxworks</code>
  <li><code>export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`</code>
  <li><code>(cd ace; make && cd ../tests; make && cd ../TAO; make) &gt;
    make.log</code>
</ol>

    <P>For Win32 hosts, please see the detailed instructions for building
      and installing ACE and TAO in
      <a href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#vxworks">ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html</a>,
      and
      <a href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#VxWorks/NT">Building ACE on
        Tornado/NT hosts for VxWorks targets</a>
    </P>

    <P>Please note that dynamic loading of libraries is not supported
      by TAO for any cross-compiled target.  Therefore, dynamic
      service configuration of the TAO ORB is not supported.
    </p>

    <P>If using perfect hashing, TAO_IDL needs gperf to be built on
      the host. That's the default on many platforms.  First, build
      <code>gperf</code> in the
      <code>ACE_wrappers/apps/gperf/src/</code> directory.
    </P>

    <H4>Which one is right for me?</H4>

    <P>Using links to cross-compile TAO may appear simpler at first
      glance.  However, storing the location in the
      <CODE>platform_macros.GNU</CODE> is more amenable for
      sites where many developers share the same configuration files,
      or where ACE+TAO are compiled once and used by a medium or large
      size group.
    </P>

<HR><P>
<H3>On Windows NT and Windows 2000 and Windows XP</H3>

<P><CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> does not contain its own preprocessor, so it
needs to use an external preprocessor.  Depending on which compiler was
used to build <CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE>, the default preprocessor will change.
For example, if compiled with MSVC, <CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> will look for
CL.EXE in the path. There are cases where this will not work, such as in cross-compiling
or if the preprocessor is not in the path.  These situations require that
environment variables are set on the machine to override the
built-in settings.  More information about these environment variables can
be found in the <a href="docs/compiler.html#idl_env">TAO_IDL documentation.</a></P>

<P>It is also mandatory to set the <CODE>ACE_ROOT</CODE> environment
variable as outlined in the
<a href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html">ACE
installation notes</A> and the <code>TAO_ROOT</code> environment variable.
  </P>

Remember to <a href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html">set
up ACE</A> before building TAO.

Make sure that you first build <code>$TAO_ROOT\TAO_IDL</code> and then <code>
$TAO_ROOT\tao</code> because in order to compile the core TAO libraries
you need to have <code>TAO_IDL</code> compiled.

<H4>Visual C++ 7.1 and newer</H4>

<P>It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
<CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> because the Visual C++ 7.1 Project files
are setup up to work in this configuration. If you move it, then make
sure you regenerate the project files to look for the include and
library files in the correct place. The default place for placing the
library files are $ACE_ROOT/lib. You can change this setting in <a
href="../bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acedefaults.mpb"> this base
project </a> file.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 7.1, use ACE.sln). <P>

  <LI>First make sure <CODE>ACE_wrappers\bin</CODE> is listed in the Executable
      Directories in Tools|Options.  This is needed if using the TAO_IDL
      compiler under MSVC.  If you intend to also use the release
      version of the libraries in the same workspace you have to be
      careful, since the executable name for TAO_IDL is same in debug
      and release builds. You can use only or the oethr in the same
      workspace. This shouldn't be an issue since the projects for
      tests and examples are set up to transparently use one or the
      other.
 <P>
  <LI>Load the solution <CODE>$TAO_ROOT\TAO.sln</CODE> and build first
      the TAO_IDL compiler. After that build the TAO
      library. This solution has almost all the projects under TAO
      which can be built. Therefore please pick and choose projects
      that you want to build.<P>

  <LI>To build the Param_Test, load the solution
      <CODE>tests\tests.sln</CODE>
      and build both client and server. <P>
</OL>

<H4>Visual C++ 7.0</H4>
The DOC group doesn't support TAO on VC++ 7.0 since the libraries that
were shipped with VC++ 7.0 did not work well. The DOC group supports
only VC++ 7.1, which is used by their sponsors. The above mentioned
points are also relevant to users who are trying to use TAO with VC++
7.1. Additionally, all required options are set for the generated .sln
files. If something is missing then it is probably a bug with
MPC. Please report such bugs to the tao-users newsgroups.

<H4>Upgrading From Older Releases</H4>

<P>When a newer version of ACE/TAO is installed, rebuild all should be
used to make sure everything is built correctly.</P>

<H4>Changing Include Paths</H4>

<P>If you prefer <code>#include &lt;corba.h&gt;</code> over <code> #include
&lt;tao/corba.h&gt;</code> then you will need to change your Project Settings
to also contain the <code>TAO/tao</code> directory.  You'll find this in the
C/C++ settings under Input.</P>

<H4>Creating Static Libraries (*.lib)</H4>

<P> Instructions for dynamic libraries apply to static libraries as
well. Users will have to use the _Static.sln files for
creating static libraries and linking with them.

<H4>MinGW and Cygwin</H4> <P>

<P>First, follow the build instructions in the
<A HREF="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#mingw">ACE installation notes.</A>
When building with MinGW and Cygwin you are using the GNU make under Windows.
When you use make from the commandline, make sure that <code>TAO_ROOT</code> is
set to a full path or to <code>%ACE_ROOT%/TAO</code>, which will also result
in setting a full path. Setting it with the Unix style to <code>$ACE_ROOT/TAO</code>
will not work, setting it using the make style to <code>$(ACE_ROOT)/TAO</code> looks
to work but will cause problems when building the TAO services, so don't do that.
The correct way is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>set TAO_ROOT=%ACE_ROOT%/TAO</code></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<H3>Perl Scripts</H3>

<P>Several of TAO's tests and examples contain perl scripts that automate the
execution of these tests. The scripts are found as "run_test.pl" in the
directory of the test.</p>

<P> The versions of perl that we use are 5.005_02 on NT and 5.003 on Solaris.
The scripts may work on earlier versions of perl, but we cannot say for sure
that they do.</P>

<HR>
<P>

<H3>Minimum CORBA</H3>

<P>By default, all components in TAO will be compiled.  If you only
want support for <A HREF="docs/minimumTAO.html">minimumTAO</A>, define
TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA. This can be accomplished by the following:
create <code>ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features</code>
with the contents:</p>
<code>minimum_corba=1</code><p>
Then regenerate the project files with MPC using <code>perl bin/mwc.pl</code>,
see also <A HREF="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#MPC">ACE-INSTALL.html</A> for more info
about the MPC generation. This <code>miminum_corba=1</code> will add compiler
flags to the C++ compiler and the IDL compiler to indicate that minimum corba
is enabled.
For your own project code you can define TAO_HAS_MINIMUM_CORBA in the ace/config.h file or
by using <CODE>make minimum_corba=1</CODE> when you compile TAO after that.</P>

<strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">WARNING:</font></blink></strong>
Make sure that if you build the orbsvcs with minimum_corba=1 you also
build the core libraries with minimum_corba=1!<P>

<HR>
<P>

<H3>CORBA/e compact and micro</H3>

<P>By default, all components in TAO will be compiled.  If you only
want support for CORBA/e compact or micro you must regenerate the
makefiles shipped with the distribution.
This can be accomplished by the following:
create <code>ACE_wrappers/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/default.features</code>
with the contents:</p>
<code>corba_e_compact=1</code><p>
or</p>
<code>corba_e_micro=1</code><p>
Then regenerate the project files with MPC using <code>perl bin/mwc.pl</code>,
see also <A HREF="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#MPC">ACE-INSTALL.html</A> for more info
about the MPC generation. This <code>corba_e_x=1</code> will add compiler
flags to the C++ compiler and the IDL compiler to indicate that CORBA/e
is enabled.
For your own project code you can define <code>CORBA_E_COMPACT</code> or
<code>CORBA_E_MICRO</code>
in the ace/config.h file.</P>

  <LI>If you just want to build TAO and associated tests, examples,
  and associated utility libraries, we recommend the following
  alternatives:
    <UL>
    <LI> Build ACE and TAO seperately. ACE needs to be built first and
  instructins for building ACE are available at <a
  href="../ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#MPC">ACE-INSTALL</a>. GNUmakefiles and
  project files for TAO can be generated by using the following
  commands:<p>
    <CODE> $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl TAO.mwc -type gnuace </CODE> <p>
   from <CODE> $TAO_ROOT </CODE> to generate GNUmakefiles. Use <CODE>
  -type vc71 </CODE>  to generate VC71 project and solution files,
  or <CODE>-type vc8</CODE> for VC8 project and solution files, or
   <CODE>-type bmake</CODE> for Borland C++ make files.<p>
   <LI> Build ACE+TAO together in one shot. To do that please issue
  the following commands: <p>
  <CODE> $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl TAO_ACE.mwc </CODE> <p>
   from <CODE>$TAO_ROOT</CODE>. This will generate GNUmakefiles for
  ACE, gperf, and core ACE+TAO libraries. Issuing a
  <CODE>'make'</CODE> from <CODE>$TAO_ROOT </CODE> will build all of
  the above in one shot. You can use <CODE> -type vc71 </CODE> to
  generate VC71 project and workspace files. <CODE>TAO_ACE.sln</CODE>
  can be used by users to build ACE+TAO from a single workspace
  file. Users can use <CODE> -type vc8 </CODE> to generate the VC8
  solutions files. <p>
  </UL>
  <LI>If you want to build CIAO and its associated libraries
  please see <a href="CIAO/CIAO-INSTALL.html"> CIAO-INSTALL <a> for
  details.
