<H3>Building and Installing TAO</H3>

<!--#include virtual="/~schmidt/TAO-versions-i.html" --> If you can
help port TAO to other platforms we'd appreciate it. <P>

TAO can be obtained <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-obtain.html">electronically</A>
via the WWW and ftp.  <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</A> is bundled
with the TAO release.  You'll always need the most recent version of
ACE because TAO tracks changes to ACE very closely. <P>

<strong><blink><font color="#ff0000">WARNING:</font></blink></strong>
For users who have used ACE with other ORBs, linking TAO with a
version of ACE that is also linked against another ORB vendor's
library, <EM>e.g.</EM>, liborbix.so, will produce undefined and most
likely unpredictable and erroneous results. <P>

<h4><strong><a name="makenotes">A Note On Make</a></strong></h4>

Since TAO is built atop ACE, TAO re-uses ACE's Makefile structure as
well.  Thus, just like ACE requires GNU Make, so too does TAO.  More
exactly, versions of <code>make</code> which are known to <em>not</em>
work include those from Solaris 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX, the latest BSD,
etc.<p>

GNU Make can be obtained from various places in source form.<P>

<h3>For Cross-Compiled Targets, such as VxWorks and LynxOS</h3>

If you are building TAO for a VxWorks target, please see the detailed
instructions for building and installing ACE and TAO in <a
href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/ACE-INSTALL.html#vxworks">$ACE_ROOT/ACE-INSTALL.html</a>.<p>

Cross-compiling TAO is not much different than building it for
self-host.  The one major difference is that TAO's IDL compiler must
be built and run on the host; it's not necessary to run it on the
target.  It's easiest to set this up by using a symlink (Unix) or copy
of <code>tao_idl</code> (NT).  By way of example, here is how I setup
my Unix (SunOS5, using g++) workspace to support cross-compilation
(for VxWorks).  It assumes that the ACE+TAO distribution has been
unpacked, with TAO below ACE_wrappers.  It uses the
ACE_wrappers/bin/create_ace_build script to create a shadow build
tree:<p>
<ol>
  <li><code>cd ACE_wrappers</code>
  <li><code>bin/create_ace_build SunOS5_g++</code>
  <li><code>bin/create_ace_build vxworks</code>
  <li><code>cd build/vxworks/TAO</code>
  <li><code>/bin/rm -r TAO_IDL</code>
  <li><code>ln -s ../../SunOS5_g++/TAO/TAO_IDL</code>
</ol><p>

To build, first on the host, then on the target:<p>
<ol>
  <li><code>cd build/SunOS5_g++</code>
  <li><code>export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`;
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
  <li><code>(cd ace; make && cd ../tests; make && cd ../TAO; make) &gt;
    make.log 2&gt;&1</code>
  <li><code>cd ../vxworks</code>
  <li><code>export ACE_ROOT=`pwd`</code>
  <li><code>(cd ace; make && cd ../tests; make && cd ../TAO; make) &gt;
    make.log 2&gt;&1</code>
</ol><p>

For NT host, please see the detailed instructions for building and
installing ACE and TAO in <a
href="../ACE-INSTALL.html#vxworks">../ACE-INSTALL.html</a>.<p>

Please note that dynamic loading of libraries is not supported by TAO
for any cross-compiled target.  Therefore, dynamic service
configuration of the TAO ORB is not supported.<p>

NOTE: TAO_IDL currently needs gperf to be built on the host.  It's in
the <code>ACE_wrappers/apps/gperf/src/</code> directory.  Then, a
symlink or copy must be added to the <code>bin/</code> directory for
the target.  This restriction should be removed in the near future.<p>


<HR><P>
<H3>On Windows NT</H3>

<P><CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> on NT will look for the Microsoft Visual C++ 
compiler as "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin\CL.EXE".  If this 
compiler is located elsewhere (or if using a different compiler)
add a variable CPP_LOCATION to your environment.  This variable will
override the default.
</P>

Remember to <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/ACE-INSTALL.html">set 
up ACE</A> before building TAO.

<H4>Visual C++ 5.0</H4>

<P>It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
<CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> because the Visual C++ 5 Project files
are set up to work in this configuration. If you move it, then make
sure you change the project files to look for the include and library
files in the correct place.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 5.0, use ace.dsw or 
      ace-vc50.dsw, whichever is in your copy of ACE). <P>
  
  <LI>Make sure <CODE>ACE_wrappers\ace</CODE> is listed in the Executable 
      Directories in Tools|Options.  This is needed if using the TAO_IDL
	  compiler under MSVC.<P>

  <LI>Load the workspace <CODE>tao\TAO.dsw</CODE> and build the TAO 
      library. <P>

  <LI>To build the Cubit test, load the workspace 
      <CODE>tests\Cubit\TAO\test.dsw</CODE> and build both client 
      and server. <P>
</OL>

<H4><A NAME="taoace">TAOACE.dsw</A></H4>

<P>TAOACE.dsw is a Visual C++ 5 workspace that loads the projects 
ACE, TAO, TAO_IDL (the compiler), orbsvcs, and the Naming Service.  
The dependencies are set up to correctly between the projects so for 
example, ACE will be built automatically when TAO is built.  An easy
way to compile everything is to just compile the debug or release 
version of the Naming Service.</P>

<H4>Visual C++ 4.x</H4>

<OL>
  <LI>In Tools|Options, go to the Directories page and make sure that
      include files paths includes ACE_wrappers\ and the root directory of
      TAO (which can be <CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> if installed there).
      The library files paths should include <CODE>ACE_wrappers\ace</CODE>.<P>

  <LI>Load the project file <CODE>tao\TAO.mdp</CODE> and build the TAO
      library.<P>

  <LI>To build the Cubit test, load the project file
      <CODE>tests\Cubit\TAO\test.mdp</CODE> and build both client and
      server.<P>
</OL>

<H4>Changing Include Paths</H4>

<P>If you prefer <code>#include &lt;corba.h&gt;</code> over <code> #include 
&lt;tao/corba.h&gt;</code> then you will need to change your Project Settings 
to also contain the <code>TAO/tao</code> directory.  You'll find this in the
C/C++ settings under Input.</P>

<H4>Creating Static Libraries (*.lib)</H4>

<P>TAO, orbsvcs, TAO_IDL, and the Simple Test all have extra project files 
for static library builds.  TAOACE_static.dsw contains all these projects,
and is set up much like <A HREF="#taoace">TAOACE.dsw</A>.  To use the static
libraries in a project, make sure to the following settings are used in
the Project Settings.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><strong>C/C++ | General:</strong> Add the Preprocessor Definitions 
      <CODE>TAO_HAS_DLL=0</CODE>, <CODE>ACE_HAS_DLL=0</CODE> and 
      <CODE>__ACE_INLINE__=0</CODE>
  <LI><strong>C/C++ | Code Generation:</strong> Change Run-time
      library to <CODE>Debug Multithreaded</CODE> (or
      <CODE>Multithreaded</CODE> for Release)
  <LI><strong>Link:</strong> Link with the static libs, such as
      TAOs.lib or TAOsd.lib
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="#VC">How to add IDL files into your Visual C++ projects</A></H3>
Point of contact: <A HREF="mailto:nanbor@cs.wustl.edu">Nanbor Wang</A>.

<P>Each IDL file generates .h, .i and .cpp files. Here is an example of
adding an IDL file named foobar.idl into a VC project.
<OL>
  <LI>Create/open the workspace. Create server project and client project if
      you haven't had them ready. Add the IDL file &lt;foobar.idl&gt and other
      non-IDL generated files into both client and server projects.</LI>

  <LI>Added foobarC.h, foobarC.i, foobarC.cpp, foobarS.h, foobarS.i, and 
      foobarS.cpp into the server project and foobarC.h, foobarC.i, and 
	  foobarC.cpp into the client project.</LI>

  <LI>Now open the project setting window (Project -&gt; Setting... or just 
      press Alt-F7.) Select the IDL files in both client and server projects. 
	  Choose to set the setting for "All Configuration." Make sure the 
	  "Always use custom build step" is checked and "Exclude from build" is
	  unchecked.</LI>

  <LI>Click on the "Custom Build" tab. Add this entry as the build command 
      for IDL files:<BR><BR>

      <PRE>..\..\..\TAO_IDL\tao_idl $(InputName).idl</PRE>
      Notice that your absolute path to TAO_IDL may vary.</LI>

  <LI>Now add the following entries as "Output file(s)."<BR><BR>

      <PRE>
      $(InputName)S.h
      $(InputName)C.h
      $(InputName)C.i
      $(InputName)C.cpp
      $(InputName)S.i
      $(InputName)S.cpp
      $(InputName)S_T.h
      $(InputName)S_T.i
      $(InputName)S_T.cpp
      </PRE>
      Add only one entry in each line.</LI>
  
  <LI>You might also want to add the TAO_IDL compiler in as a dependency here
      if you update TAO often.  That way, if the compiler is changed, the
	  IDL files are recompiled automatically in the next build.</LI>

  <LI>We are all set. Click OK.</LI>

  <LI>Add foobarC.cpp to client project and foobarC.cpp and foobarS.cpp to 
      server project.</LI>
</OL>

<p>Notice that these procedures only setup the IDL compiler to perform 
correctly. </p>

<P>P.S. If anyone knows how to set a default setting in VC so we don't
need to perform these procedures every time a new project gets set up,
please let us know. Thanks.
