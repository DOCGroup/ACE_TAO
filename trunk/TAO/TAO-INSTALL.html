<H3>Building and Installing TAO</H3>

TAO has been ported and tested Windows NT, Solaris, VxWorks, and
Linux.  I expect that major portions of the release will port easily
to other platforms that ACE has been ported to.  If you can help port
TAO to other platforms we'd appreciate it. <P>

TAO can be obtained <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-obtain.html">electronically</A>
via the WWW and ftp.  Bundled with the TAO release is <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</A>.  You will
need the most recent version of ACE because TAO tends to track changes
to ACE rather closely. <P>

A quick build note for users who have used ACE with other ORBs:
linking TAO with a version of ACE that is also linked against another
ORB vendor's library, <EM>e.g.</EM>, liborbix.so, will produce
undefined and most likely unpredictable and erroneous results. <P>

<H4><STRONG><A NAME="makenotes">A Note On Make</A></STRONG></H4>
    
<P>
Since TAO is built on top  ofACE, TAO re-uses ACE's Makefile structure 
as well.  Thus, just like ACE requires GNU Make, so too does TAO.  
More exactly, versions of <CODE>make</CODE> which are known to 
<EM>not</EM> work include those from Solaris 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX, the 
latest BSD, etc.<P>

GNU Make can be obtained from various places in source form.<P>

<H3>On Windows NT</H3>

To compile <CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE> on NT, you may need to set the
environment variable <CODE>CPP_PATH</CODE> to where CL.exe is
installed on your machine.  By default, we set this variable to
"C:/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin".  Your location may vary, however.
Notice that if you forget to set this variable before compiling
<CODE>TAO_IDL</CODE>, you can use <CODE>CPP_LOCATION</CODE> to specify
the absolute pathname to CL.exe. We set it to "C:/Program
Files/DevStudio/VC/bin/CL.exe" when we do use it.<P>

Remember to <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/ACE-INSTALL.html">set 
up ACE</A> before building TAO.

<H4>Visual C++ 5.0</H4>

<P>It works best if TAO is placed in ACE_wrappers so TAO ends up in
<CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> because the Visual C++ 5 Project files
are set up to work in this configuration. If you move it, then make
sure you change the project file to look for the include and library
files in the correct place.  If you are using <A 
HREF="#taoace">TAOACE.dsw</A> then you shouldn't need to worry about 
this.</P>

<OL>
  <LI> Make sure ACE is built (For Visual C++ 5.0, use ace.dsw or 
       ace-vc50.dsw, whichever is in your copy of ACE). <P>

  <LI> Load the workspace <CODE>tao\TAO.dsw</CODE> and build the TAO 
       library. <P>

  <LI> To build the Cubit test, load the workspace 
       <CODE>tests\Cubit\TAO\test.dsw</CODE> and build both client 
       and server. <P>
</OL>

<H4><A NAME="taoace">TAOACE.dsw</A></H4>

<P>TAOACE.dsw is a Visual C++ 5 workspace that loads the projects 
ACE, TAO, TAO_IDL (the compiler), and orbsvcs.  The dependencies are 
set up to correctly between the projects so for example, ACE will 
be built automatically when TAO is built.</P>

<H4>Visual C++ 4.x</H4>

<OL>
  <LI> In Tools|Options, go to the Directories page and make sure that include
       files paths includes ACE_wrappers\ and the root directory of TAO (which
       can be <CODE>ACE_wrappers\TAO</CODE> if installed there).  The library files 
       paths should include <CODE>ACE_wrappers\ace</CODE>. <P>

  <LI> Load the project file <CODE>tao\TAO.mdp</CODE> and build the TAO library. <P>

  <LI> To build the Cubit test, load the project file <CODE>tests\Cubit\TAO\test.mdp</CODE>
       and build both client and server. <P>
