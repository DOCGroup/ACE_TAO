The Cos_ECBasic test shows how to:

        . Create a standard Cos Event Channel,
        . Write simple COS compliant consumers and suppliers,
        . Connect consumers and suppliers to the COSEC,
        . Send and receive events form the EC.

For initialization, the CosEC_Basic test first creates and initializes
a TAO real-time EC (Rtec).  Then, it initializes QOS parameters for
the Supplier and Consumers and then initializes a COSEC (Corba Object
Service compliant Event Channel).

To test the COSEC the test initializes a Supplier and a Consumer ,
connects them to the COSEC.  The Supplier then sends an event to the
channel which is delivered to the Consumer via the <push> method.
This method then prints a message to show that an event was delivered
to the Consumer.

Finally the Rtec and COSEC are shutdown to finish the test.

NOTE: please do not attempt to compile this test till I've integrated
the COSEC code into orbsvcs.
