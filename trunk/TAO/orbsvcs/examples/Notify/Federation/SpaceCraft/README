This example simulates spacecraft constellation. Each spacecraft
connects to a constellation-wide multicast group to which it
forwards pre-filtered messages on behalf of its agents. To run
the example start a few spacecrafts (in separate terminal windows):

$ ./craft a
$ ./craft b
$ ./craft c

Then start a few agents (from ../Agent) for each spacecraft:

$ ./agent 1 a
$ ./agent 2 a

$ ./agent 1 b
$ ./agent 2 b

$ ./agent 1 c
$ ./agent 2 c

You should be able to observer that each agent receives only
every third message from the agents on other spacecrafts.
