$Id$

        This directory contains possibly the most simple example of
the real-time event service.  It contains three executables; a
consumer, supplier and a program to create the event channel itself.

	Run using the run_test.pl script or:

$ ../../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ./Service
$ ./Consumer
$ ./Supplier

	more advanced tests are available in
$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Event and $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/EC_*
