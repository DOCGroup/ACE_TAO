  Shows how to use the scheduling service in conjunction with
the real-time event channel.  The test has a single consumer that
subscribes for two event types, using different RT_Infos for each. A
supplier pushes those events also using different RT_Infos.
  The event-channel cooperates with the scheduling service to
compute a schedule and assign priorities to each event. The event
channel will use different queues for those events, each queue
serviced by threads at different priorities.

	The example can be run using a pre-computed schedule:

$ ./Service

	or it can generate the schedule again:

$ ./Service -c


	NOTE: the current version uses the old event channel because
we haven't coimpleted the integration between the new EC and the
scheduling service.
