                        CORBA COS Event Service
                        -----------------------
The CosEvent_Service is a COS compilant Event Service.

The service is registered with the naming service with the name
"CosEventService" .It exposes the <EventChannel> interface which can be
used by suppliers and consumers to send and receive events.


To run the Event Channel:
------------------------
1. you should have a running Naming Service.
   if not, start one at $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service

2. if you want to use the -t option you should have a running
   Real Time Event Channel.
   if not, start one at $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service

3. execute the CosEvent_Service.

Command line parameters:
------------------------
      -n <COS Event Service name>
        specifies the name with which to register the Event Service.

      -e <Real Time Event Service name>
        specifies the name with which to *look* for the RtEC.

       -r
        specifies that a local Real Time Event Channel (Rtec) should be
        created and used.
        If you specify this option but Rtec is not already running, then the
        CosEvent_Service starts its own Rtec.

The next 3 options are used to introduce a filtering mechanism for the
Event Channel based on event types and source ids.

        -e ["EventType_1 EventType_2..."]
        specifies the event types for the ConsumerQOS.When the Rtec is being
        setup, the ConsumerQOS is specified.
        The event types should start at  >= ACE_ES_EVENT_UNDEFINED = 16.
        e.g. -e "17 20 40" specifies that event types with ids 17, 20 and 40
        should be passed to the consumers.

        -o ["EventSourceID_1 EventSourceID_2.."]
        specifies the source ids for the ConsumerQOS.

        -p ["sourceID EventTypeID"]
        specifies a pair of sourceid and event type for the Supplier QOS.
