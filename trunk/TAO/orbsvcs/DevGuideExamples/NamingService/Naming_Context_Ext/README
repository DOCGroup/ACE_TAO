The example in this directory illustratues how to convert between CosNames,
Stringified Names, and URLs.

A Name can be converted to a stringified Name by to_string operation. A stringified
Name can be converted to a Name by to_name operation. The resolve_str operation
resolves an object by passing a strigified Name.

The MessengerServer writes its corbaname URL to a file by calling to_url and
the MessengerClient reads the URL file to get the MessengerServer object reference.
