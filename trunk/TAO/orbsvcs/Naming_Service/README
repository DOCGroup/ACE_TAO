README:
======
        This directory consists of the files implementing the TAO
Naming Service.

        The TAO Naming Service makes use of IP Multicast to process
requests to the Naming Service.

To Run:
======

        % Naming_Service [-ORBport port] [-ORBobjrefstyle url]
                         [-ORBnameserviceport nsport]
                         [-s context_size] [-t time]

Arguments:
==========
        port - The ORB port
        nsport - Multicast port.
        context_size - Size of the hash table allocated upon the
        creation of the root Naming Context (if one is created).
        (All contexts created under the root will use the same size
        for their hash tables).
        time - how long the server should listen for requests before exiting.

Environment Variables:
=====================

        NameServicePort - Multicast port.

Sample Run:
==========

      % Naming_Service -ORBport 20000 -ORBobjrefstyle url -ORBnameserviceport 19999
starting up daemon <unknown>
opening dynamic service Resource_Factory
did dynamic on Resource_Factory, error = 0
opening dynamic service Client_Strategy_Factory
did dynamic on Client_Strategy_Factory, error = 0
opening dynamic service Server_Strategy_Factory
did dynamic on Server_Strategy_Factory, error = 0
listening as object <iiop:1.0//tango:20000/P35194c690003809cRootPOA/child_poa/NameService>
The multicast server setup is done.

NameService Client:
==================

        A client of the TAO Naming Service will use the ORB
resolve_initial_references to resolve the NamingService object. This
will be done using Multicast by default. This behavior can be
overridden by these 2 ways.

        1. passing the argument -ORBnameserviceior ior.
           This ior is got from the output of the Naming_Service from
           line 'listening as object <iiop:..>'.

        2. setting the env. variable 'NameService'.

For example if a client wants to use the Naming_Service from the
sample run it would be like,

        %client -ORBnameserviceior
                <iiop:1.0//tango:20000/P35194c690003809cRootPOA/child_poa/NameService>

or set the environment variable,

        in a tcsh ,

        % setenv NameService <iiop:1.0//tango:20000/P35194c690003809cRootPOA/child_poa/NameService>

        and then run the client,

        % client <.. client's arguments>

        These methods might be needed in an environment where there is
more than one NamingService to avoid the confusion of a server
registering its object with one NamingService and the client getting
the reply from some other NamingService.
