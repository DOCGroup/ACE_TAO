Thank you for your interest in the TAO Trading Service. The TAO
Trading Service is in the process of being ported to TAO from
VisiBroker, and therefore it won't compile. I'll send mail to the
group when the port is complete, and then people can play with it. 

Thanks,
Seth

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This version of the trading service requires the Object Space
STL. To have the trading service compile properly, prepend the following
to the makefile:

include $(STL_ROOT)/config/local.cfg

CC_INCLUDES += -I$(STD)
CC_INCLUDES += -pta

CPPFLAGS += \
	-I$(TOOLKIT) \
	$(CC_INCLUDES) \
	$(CC_FLAGS) \
	$(CC_DEFINES) \
	$(CC_EH) \
	$(CC_MT)

The final trading service server application needs to link with the
following library:

LDFLAGS += -L$(STL_ROOT)/lib
LDLIBS  += -lospace

Where currently: STL_ROOT=/project/doc/irfan/ObjectSpace/SC4.0,
		 STD=$STL_ROOT/ospace/std, and
		 STL=$STL_ROOT/stl

Also, the Sequences.idl file needs to be compiled by tao_idl before
the C++ compilation begins. These sequences are used to extract
simple sequences from offer property values.

The constraint.y and constraint.l files have been compiled
into Constraint_y.cpp and Constraint_l.cpp by:

Constraint_y.cpp: constraint.y
	$(YACC) -d $<
	mv y.tab.c $@
	mv y.tab.h Constraint_Tokens.h

Constraint_l.cpp: constraint.l
	$(LEX)   $<
	mv lex.yy.c $@

It shouldn't be necessary to recompile them, but it's handy to have
this information around just in case.

Thanks,
Seth
