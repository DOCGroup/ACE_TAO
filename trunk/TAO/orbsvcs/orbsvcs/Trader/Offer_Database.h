/**
 * @class TAO_Offer_Database
 *
 * The TAO_Offer_Database encapsulates the mapping of service
 * types to those offers exported with that service types. The
 * underlying structure is a map of maps. The first maps maps the
 * service type name to a map of exported offers. The second map
 * maps the identifying index for that offer within the service
 * types. So a service type name and an index uniquely identifies an
 * exported offer. In fact, when the register export interface
 * returns a CosTrading::OfferId, it's returning no more than a
 * simple string concatenation of these two values. In addition to
 * all these wonderful things, the TAO_Offer_Database has built-in
 * locking, one reader/writer-style lock for modifying the top-level
 * map and a reader/writer-style for each of the offer
 * maps. Needless to say the locks are acquired when the
 * TAO_Offer_Database performs operations on the structures they
 * guard.
 * NOTE: TAO_Offer_Database needs to be parameterized by a
 * READER/WRITER LOCK, a RECURSIVE MUTEX, or a NULL MUTEX, not a
 * simple binary mutex! Mutexes will cause deadlock when you try to
 * contruct an iterator (which acquires a read lock on the map under
 * an existing read lock). Just don't do it, ok?
