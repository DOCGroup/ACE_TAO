/**
 * @class TAO_Bindings_Iterator
 *
 * @brief This class implements the <BindingIterator> interface that is
 * part of the <CosNaming> idl module.   This class works with Hash_Map-based
 * implementations of CosNaming::NamingContext.
 *
 * This class is templatized by the types of the underlying
 * hash table iterator and hash table entry, so that it can be
 * used for both TAO_Transient_Naming_Context and
 * TAO_Persistent_Naming_Context (and any other classes with
 * underlying data structures supporting
 * ACE_Hash_Map_Manager/Iterator - like interfaces).
 *
 * Instances of <TAO_Bindings_Iterator>s affect reference counts
 * of corresponding Naming Contexts. Reference count on a
 * Naming Context is incremented by one for a lifetime of each
 * instance of <TAO_Bindings_Iterator> created for that
 * context, i.e., a Naming Context cannot
 * be cleaned up (but, of course, it can be invalidated) before
 * all of its iterators have been cleaned up.  When <destroy>
 * method is invoked on a Naming Context, all of its iterators are
 * destroyed in a "lazy evaluation" fashion, i.e., whenever a next
 * operation is invoked on an iterator, and it can detect that
 * the corresponding Naming Context has been invalidated, the
 * iterator is destroyed.
