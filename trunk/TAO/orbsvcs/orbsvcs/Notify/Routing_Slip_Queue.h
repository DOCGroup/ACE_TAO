   * \brief A queue of Routing_Slips waiting to be persisted.
   *
   * The Routing_Slip_Queue keeps a queue of Routing_Slips waiting
   * to be written to persistent storage.  The "allowed" parameter
   * determines how many Routing_Slips can be handled simultaneously
   * by the persistent storage.  Until this threshold is reached,
   * Routing_Slips are not held in the queue, but pass straight through.
   *
   * Once the allowe number of Routing_Slips are being handled, any
   * additional requests are held in the queue until persistence is
   * complete for another Routing_Slips.
   *
   * Having Routing_Slips waiting in the queue is "a good thing" [TM]
   * because it allows delivery completions to be applied to the
   * routing slip before it is written -- thereby reducing or completely
   * eliminating the number of actual writes to persistent storage.
   *
   * Experimentation indicates that a good value for "allowed" is 1.
   *
   * Allowed == 0 is treated as a special case meaning pass all Routing_Slips
   * through the queue immediately.  Setting it a good way to test how well
   * your storage device withstands continuous beating.
