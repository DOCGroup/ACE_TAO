/**
 * @class TAO_LB_Signal_Handler
 *
 * @brief Active object designed to handle signals synchronously.
 *
 * This class handles signals synchronously in the multi-threaded case,
 * and asynchronously through a Reactor in the single-threaded case.
 * @par
 * The goal of this signal handler is to ensure proper cleanup of
 * remote objects and resources created by the LoadManager upon
 * interruption by signals.  For example, suppose a user sends a
 * SIGINT (e.g. types CTRL-C) signal to the LoadManager service, the
 * LoadManager should be shutdown gracefully so that all remote
 * resources handled by the LoadManager are cleaned up.
