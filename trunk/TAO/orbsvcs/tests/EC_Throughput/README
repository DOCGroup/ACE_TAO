	This test tries to stress the Event_Service by sending events
in bursts, the user can control the size of the events, the size of
the burst, the number of bursts and the time between the bursts, the
number of suppliers and the number of consumers.

        There are two versions of the test, a collocated version,
contained in the ECT_Throughput executable.  The non-collocated
version uses the event channel executable in the ../../Event_Service
direction, and two local binaries (ECT_Consumer and
ECT_Supplier).  Both versions require a Naming Service.


	To run the test you can use (as usual) the run_test.pl script
on this directory.  If you want to manually run the tests here are
some examples, usually each one of the commands below is executed on
its own window:

# Run the collocated test using the default configuration:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ./ECT_Throughput

# Run the non-collocated test using the default configuration:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ../../Event_Service/Event_Service
$ ./ECT_Consumer
$ ./ECT_Supplier

# Run the non-collocated tests using 4 suppliers, notice that the
# ECT_Consumer needs to know the number of suppliers to terminate
# correctly:
$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service
$ ../../Event_Service/Event_Service
$ ./ECT_Consumer -s 4
$ ./ECT_Supplier -s 4

	Other options for the tests can be obtained using the -?, for
example:

# Find out the options for the collocated test:
$ ./ECT_Throughput -?
