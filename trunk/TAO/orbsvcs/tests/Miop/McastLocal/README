@page McastLocal Test README File

This test is a copy of the McastHello test but modified so that the
servers are listening only on the loopback interface (via the
  "-ORBListenerInterface *=127.0.0.1" in the svc_server1.conf for server1
and the
  "-ORBListenerInterface CopyPreferredInterfaces" in the svc_server2.conf
and the server2's otherwise redundant command line
  "-ORBPreferredInterface *=127.0.0.1" orb_init parameter).
The client has also been modified to send the broadcast out on the
loopback interface (via its
  "-ORBPreferredInterface *=127.0.0.1" orb_init parameter).

This is testing that these configuartion options are correctly working
for MIOP.
