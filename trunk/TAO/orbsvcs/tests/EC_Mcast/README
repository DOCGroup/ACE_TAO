This test can be pretty complicated to run, a sample configuration file is
included to help you startup.

	The basic idea to remember is that a "Federation" is a logical
grouping of incoming and outgoing mcast addresses that share the same
multicast port.  The test reads the configuration file to find out
which Federations are globally available defined, but the comand line
is used to specify the list of federations that are actually running
on each process.
	The test requires the Naming Serivice:

$ ../../Naming_Service/Naming_Service

	this is an *extremely* silent service, don't be surprized if
you see no output.

	Then you ough to run at least two copies of the test, on
different windows (to make the test interesting):

$ ./EC_Mcast -p ECM1.pid -c sample.cfg -n 200 -t 500000 -f Set01
$ ./EC_Mcast -p ECM2.pid -c sample.cfg -n 200 -t 500000 -f Set02

	the test will report the number of events received, if you run
just one of the processes you will notice that this number is smaller,
this indicates that some events come from a "remote" event.
