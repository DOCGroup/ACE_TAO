Currently the test app is compiled to:

	- binds a new context ("MyContext").
	- binds the compound name ("MyContext;MyName") into the
	  root context.
	- resolves the compount name ("MyContext;MyName").

(Functioning of hierarchical test implies functioning of the flat case)


A collection of various tests selectable by command line arguments will be available later.
