This program tests the basic FT IOGR implementation. The aim is to set
a primary server and see whether the client gives preference to
contact a primary for its first invocation. When the primary is killed
it contacts the secondary for next invocation.

To aid this we have three executables. Two copies of the server are
started. A manager is then to merge these two iors and designate the
second as primary. The merged IOR is then written to another file.

The client is started with an option to read the merged IOR. Then
invocations are then made.

Run the application as follows:

$./server -o <file1.ior>
$./server -o <file2.ior>
$./Manager -a file://<file1.ior> -b file://<file2.ior> -c <output.ior>
$./client -k file://output.ior
