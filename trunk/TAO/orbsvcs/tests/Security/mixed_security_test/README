1. ior has secure profile, client is secured, object in permitted list
2. ior has secure profile, client unsecured, object NOT in permitted list
3. ior has unsecure profile, client is secured, object

This test verifies that the ORB's secure invocation mechanism is
functioning properly.  It expands on what the Secure_Invocation does
by activating an object with two separate ORBs and POAs. One of the POAs
has a SecQoPNoProtection policy assigned and thus should permit also
invocations over non-secure transport.

The test verifies that a secure client can make invocations, using both
the "secure" and the "non-secure" IOR from the server. Note that for
the server to support the non-secure invocations it must have -SSLNoProtection
in its sevice configuration file.

The test verifies that a non-secure client can only make invocations through
the "non-secure" IOR from the server. An invocation through the "secure" IOR
results in CORBA::NO_PERMISSION exception.

The expected test output is the following (actual "certificate issuer"
contents may differ):
