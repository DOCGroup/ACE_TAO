Test Run modes:

% run_test.pl csd    // CSD without SSLIOP
% run_test.pl ssliop // default: SSLIOP without CSD
% run_test.pl ssliop-csd  // CSD with SSLIOP

This test demonstrates CSD (Custom Servant Dispatch) incompatibility with
 SSLIOP transport protocol. In CSD the first server-side PI (Portable-
 Interception) point (Receive_Request_Service_Context) is called on
 a different thread from the rest of the server code PI points. SSLIOP
 is heavily dependent upon PICurrent. CSD doesn't copy over any TSS
 data and therefore breaks SSLIOP.

This test in ssliop-csd should run success once CSD-SSLIOP compatibility is
 resolved.
