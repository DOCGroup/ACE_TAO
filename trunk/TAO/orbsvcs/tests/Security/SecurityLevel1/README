	This test checks if the SecurityLevel 1 is working
correctly. The Security Level1 has only one method
'get_attributes'. In this test, when a client wants to access the
server, the server checks if the client is authorized to do so by
getting its attributes using the get_attributes method. It then compares
those attribute values with its own set of values and makes a decision.

	The server and client certificates and private keys are
provided. The Certificate Authority's certificate is ca.pem.

To Run Manually:

1. Set the Environment Variable SSL_CERT_FILE to ca.pem

 $ export SSL_CERT_FILE=ca.pem

2. Set SSL_CERT_DIR to this directory.

 $ export SSL_CERT_DIR=$PWD

3. Start the server

$ ./server -ORBSvcConf server.conf -o ior_file &

4  Run the client

$ ./client -ORBSvcConf client.conf -k file://ior_file

	The client should print out 'AUTHORIZED' if the subject of the
client certificate matches that of the dummy certificate created by
the server.

	Could also be run using the perl script.
