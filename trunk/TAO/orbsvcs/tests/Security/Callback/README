This test is designed to excercise the connection cache related code
in a complex pluggable protocol such as SSLIOP.

An object reference is sent to the target as an "in" parameter.  The
target then uses that object reference to invoke a callback method on
an object residing at the client.

If the secure connection is not cached properly, then it will not be
possible to invoke the callback method on the client.
