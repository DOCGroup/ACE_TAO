This test verifies that the ORB's secure invocation mechanism is
functioning properly.  It does so by the doing the following:

	- Invoking a request over standard (insecure) IIOP on a target
	  object that requires secure invocation (e.g. over SSLIOP).
	  The client should receive a CORBA::NO_PERMISSION exception.

	- Invoking a request via a security mechanism, such as
	  SSLIOP.  The AccessId associated with the given request is
	  obtained from the SecurityCurrent object, and displayed.

The expected test output is the following (actual "certificate issuer"
contents may differ):

Activated as <IOR:...>
(1768|1628) Received CORBA::NO_PERMISSION from server, as expected.

Secure_Invocation test passed.

Security::SecAttribute 0 -- Certificate Issuer
