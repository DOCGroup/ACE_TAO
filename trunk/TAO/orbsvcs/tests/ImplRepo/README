Here are a few tests for the ImplRepo.  The best way to test is to
use the run_test.pl passing it one of the following arguments:

airplane                  runs airplane client and server without ImplRepo.
airplane_ir               same as above but uses ImplRepo.
nt_service_ir             same as above but runs ImplRepo as an NT service.
nestea                    runs nestea client and server without ImplRepo.
nestea_ir                 same as above but uses ImplRepo.
both_ir                   combines airplane_ir and nestea_ir.
persistent_ir             same as airplane_ir, but using persistent ImplRepo.

The nt_service_ir test will work only on Win32 platforms. For the test to
run successfully, these conditions must be met:

--  The user must be logged in as administrator, or have administrative
    priveleges (in order to register an NT service).

--  ACE_ROOT must be set to the ACE_wrappers directory in the system
    environment.

--  ACE_ROOT/bin must be in the system path.


How to use the NT_ImplRepo_Service
==================================

To set the options for the TAO ImplRepo Sevice, go to the Services icon
in the Settings group under the start menu (start menu -> settings ->
services). There, highlight the NT_ImplRepo_Service, which is the name
used by the ImplRepo Service when it is registered. After it's
highlighted, you should see at the bottom of the dialog box an area to
specify options for ImplRepo_Service. Just enter the options you wish in 
that edit box and everything should just work. However, some options, such as
-ORBDebugLevel, won't work since an NT service can't write output to
standard out.

1. Syntax

        % NT_ImplRepo_Service [-i value]
                              [-r]
                              [-s]
                              [-k]
                              [-t n]
                              [-d]

2. Optional Command-line Arguments

        -i value
                Install this program as an NT service, with specified startup

        -r
                Remove this program from the Service Manager
        -s
                Start the service

        -k
                Kill the service

        -t value
                Set startup for an existing service

        -d
                Debug; run as a regular application

3. Usage

        To see different stages of an NT service application, you have
        to run the program several times, with different options.
        Please note: run with only one option at a time.

        a. First, you must initialize the service in the NT Service Control 
	   Manager database.  Run NT_ImplRepo_Service with -in, where n is 
	   one of the following startup options:

           // Start Type (from WinNT.h)
           //
           #define SERVICE_SYSTEM_START    0x00000001
           #define SERVICE_AUTO_START      0x00000002
           #define SERVICE_DEMAND_START    0x00000003
           #define SERVICE_DISABLED        0x00000004

           If only -i is specified, SERVICE_DEMAND_START is default option.

        b. Now you are ready to run the actual service. Run
           NT_ImplRepo_Service again, this time with -s option. If the
           service starts successfully, it will ring the system
           bell every second or so until the service is stopped.

        c. To stop service execution, run NT_ImplRepo_Service with the
           -k option.

        d. To remove the service from the Service Control Manager
           database, run NT_ImplRepo_Service with -r.

        In addition, once you have initialized this service (by using
        the -i option) you can change its startup type to one of the
        other values above.  To do this, run NT_ImplRepo_Service with
        -tn option. n is as explained above for -i.

        In order to debug the service's execution itself, use the -d
        option.
