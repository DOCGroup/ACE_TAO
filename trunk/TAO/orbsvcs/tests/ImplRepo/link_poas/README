This test validates the tao_imr link command by creating a server with 3 POAs
and showing that when linked, concurrent startup requests for different POAs
are treated as requests for the same server.

A counter example is available, run "./run_test.pl -nolink" and the 3 POAs are
registered separately and concurrent requests will trigger multiple server
starts.
