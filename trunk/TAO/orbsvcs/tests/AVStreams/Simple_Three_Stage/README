Description
-----------

This directory contains a simple three stage test with 3 processes
a. Sender
b. Distributer
c. Receiver

This test has a sender process that paces the data read from a file and sends it to 
the distributer process. The distributer acts as a conduit. It receives data from
the sender and sends it immediately to the receiver process.

The sender and receiver register their references with the Naming Service.
The distributer gets the sender and receiver references from the Naming Service.
It then binds to the receiver and sender. When the connection between the distributer 
and sender is set up the sender starts sending to the distrubuter which in turn sends
data to the receiver. When the sender has finished reading the file it tells the ditri-
buter which in turn tells the recveiver to destroy the streams set up. 


Running the test
----------------

Start the Naming Service

Start the following processes in the same order.

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-r <data_rate>]

-f filename --> The name of the file from which data needs to be sent

-r data_rate--> The rate at which the data needs to be paced.


receiver
--------

receiver [-f <filename>]

-f filename --> File into which the data received from the distributer is stored.

-s          --> flag to use SFP. This option cannot be used with -p
                TCP since SFP currently runs only over UDP.
