/*
Some assumptions about the streams created in this file:

	PACKET STREAM:
	
		* send(), recv() may not work, we can only use
		  read()/write().
		
		* write(): either send the whole packet, or send nothing

		* read(): read() will read the minimun of the
		  requested number of bytes and current packet size.
		  read() can read part of a packet, but it
		  will not read cross packet boundaris

	    There are two modes: non-discard and dicard. If a packets is
	          not read all its bytes, the remaining bytes will be
		  or not be discarded.

		  This is indicated by if (*max_pkt_size) is positive
		  (non-discard) or negative (discard)

	BYTE_STREAM: reliable

		* write(): might write only part of requested bytes
		  each time. (this is the case in SunOS4)

		* read(): might read less than requested bytes.
		  (this is the case in SunOS4).
