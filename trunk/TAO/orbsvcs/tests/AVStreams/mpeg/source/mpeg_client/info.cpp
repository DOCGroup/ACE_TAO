      Distributed real-time MPEG video audio Player v2.0\n\
 \n\
	  Distributed Systems Research Group\n\

    Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology\n\
                       October, 1995\n\
\n\
The player features common VCR functionalities like synchronized\n\
video(MPEG) and audio(.au) play back, play speed set on the fly,\n\
fast-forward, rewind, step forward, random Positioning, and more.\n\
\n\
The player is of server/client architecture. The server manages program\n\
retrieval and distribution. The client decodes video frames, plays video\n\
and audio streams, and provides a Motif style user interface.\n\
\n\
The MPEG decoder used by the client is originated from U.C.Berkeley\n\
MPEG decoder 2.0, by Lawrence A. Rowe, Ketan Patel, and Brian Smith,\n\
of Computer Science Division-EECS, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley.\n\
\n\
The Motif user interface is based on an implementation by Daeron Meyer\n\
of The Geometry Center, University of Minnesota.\n\
