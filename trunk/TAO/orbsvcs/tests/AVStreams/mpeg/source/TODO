Use - for things to do, * for urgent things, and + for things that
have been done.


Bugs
----

- States problem -- pressing play twice screws up, position is not working
- client blocks forever while exiting sometimes (often after the above)
- vs, as don't die as a result of the above
- server segfaults if addr is already in use


Things to do
------------

"Simple" things


- Make #define's into enums in common.h/globals.h

- try compiling ACE and the application with fast=1 to see if
  performance improves

- Rename "play", "play_send" etc. appropriately



"Not-so-simple" things 


- Logic for Video_Server is convoluted!!

- Need to modularize Audio_Server

- Seperate command parsing in its own class
