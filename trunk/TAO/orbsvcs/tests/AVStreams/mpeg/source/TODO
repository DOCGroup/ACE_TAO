Use - for things to do, * for urgent things, and + for things that
have been done.


Bugs
----

+ States problem -- pressing play twice screws up, position is not working
+ client blocks forever while exiting sometimes (often after the above)
+ vs, as don't die as a result of the above
+ server segfaults if addr is already in use


- IF peer i.e client aborts connection for some reason the as and vs
processes should die. It currently prints the message peer probably
aborted connection in which case we can try to exit the process.

Things to do
------------

"Simple" things


- Make #define's into enums in common.h/globals.h

+ try compiling ACE and the application with fast=1 to see if
  performance improves

- Rename "play", "play_send" etc. appropriately



"Not-so-simple" things 


+ Logic for Video_Server is convoluted!!

+ Need to modularize Audio_Server

+ Seperate command parsing in its own class

Naga:
----
- handle leaks on the server side. 

+ handle leak on the client side due to Naming Service.
