Things to do
------------

"Simple" things

- Remove kerberos warnings
- Seg fault wile exiting
  Destructor of reactor crashes the server
- Parent-Child relationship
- rttag is enabled with -r
  does it work ?
- rename Mpeg_Server to AV_Server
- Make #define's into enums in common.h/globals.h
- Change handle_input to handle_connection in
  Mpeg_Svc_Handler
- Video_Sig_Handler is in Mpeg_Server -- needs to be moved to Video_Server
- Split up VIDEO_FAST into two commands - VIDEO_FAST_{FORWARD,BACKWARD}
- create a helper class for video, and put FBread et al in that
- try compiling ACE and the application with fast=1 to see if
  performance improves
- Rename "play", "play_send" etc. appropriately

"Not-so-simple" things 

- Logic for Video_Server is convoluted!!
- Need to modularize Audio_Server
- Seperate command parsing in its own class
