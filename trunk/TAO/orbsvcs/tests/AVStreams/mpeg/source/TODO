Things to do
------------

"Simple" things

- Clear the semaphores on the client and the server!

- ORBport 0

- rttag is enabled with -r
  does it work ?

- Make #define's into enums in common.h/globals.h

+ Change handle_input to handle_connection in
  Mpeg_Svc_Handler

+ Video_Sig_Handler is in Mpeg_Server -- needs to be moved to Video_Server
  -- done

+ Split up VIDEO_FAST into two commands - VIDEO_FAST_{FORWARD,BACKWARD}

+ create a helper class for video, and put FBread et al in that

- try compiling ACE and the application with fast=1 to see if
  performance improves

- Rename "play", "play_send" etc. appropriately



"Not-so-simple" things 


- Logic for Video_Server is convoluted!!

- Need to modularize Audio_Server

- Seperate command parsing in its own class
