#
# This file contains a sample ACE_Service_Config configuration
# file specifying the strategy factories utilized by an application
# using TAO.  There are currently only two possible factories:
# Client_Strategy_Factory and Server_Strategy_Factory.  These names
# must be used as the second argument to their corresponding line,
# because that's what the ORB uses to find the desired factory.
#
# Note that there are two unordinary characteristics of the way *this*
# file is set up:
#   - both client and server strategies are specified in the same
#     file, which would only make sense for co-located clients & servers
#   - both of the factories are actually sourced out of libTAO.so
#     (TAO.DLL on Win32), and they would normally be in a separate
#     dll from the TAO ORB Core.
#
# The options which can be passed to the Resource Factory are:
#
#   -ORBresources <which>
#       where <which> can be 'global' to specify globally-held resources,
#       or 'tss' to specify thread-specific resources.
#
# The options which can be passed to the Client are:
#     <none currently>
#
# The options which can be passed to the Server are:
#
#   -ORBconcurrency <which>
#       where <which> can be 'thread-per-connection' to specify
#       use of the ACE_Threaded_Strategy concurrency strategy,
#       or 'reactive' to specify use of the ACE_Reactive_Strategy
#       concurrency strategy.
#
#   -ORBthreadflags  <flags>
#       specifies the default thread flags to use, where <flags> is a
#       logical OR'ing of the flags THR_DETACHED, THR_BOUND, THR_NEW_LWP,
#       THR_SUSPENDED, or THR_DAEMON.  Note that not every flag may be valid
#       on every platform.
#
#   -ORBdemuxstrategy <which>
#       where <which> can be one of 'dynamic', 'linear', 'active', or 'user',
#       and specifies the type of object lookup strategy used internally.
#   -ORBtablesize <unsigned>
#       specifies the size of the object table
