TAO MPEG Player
==========================

This directory contains the source code for TAO's Audio/Video Mpeg
player. This is written using the TAO's Audio/Video streaming service.

This is a modified version of the Distributed Audio/video Mpeg player
developed at the Oregon Graduate Institute. For more information about
the original player read README.OGI.

The MPEG-1 player requires X windows and hence may not work on Windows
platforms. 

To run:
======

1. Start the Naming service.

2. Start mpeg/source/server/server

3. You can start the player
        mpeg/source/client/vcr

The video and audio files can be either specified on the command line
or be read from a file in 

        ~/.vcr/vcrPrograms

The format of the entries should be like this
Three Stooges-1
/project/merengue/MPEG_movies/ts1_v.mpg
/project/merengue/MPEG_movies/ts1_a.au

i.e
Name of the Movie.
Video file path
Audio file path.

You can download some of the MPEG-1 audio and video files from this
URL.
        http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~naga/MPEG_movies

You can also download the .Info files used by the server to store the
information about the MPEG files.

If you have the ~/.vcr/vcrPrograms then you can select the Prog button
on the player and select the movie.

You can also give the audio and video files on the command line like

vcr -v video_file_path -a audio_file_path.

Using the Trading Service:
==========================

The mpeg client can also be run using the Trading service to find the
server which can give the best QoS and other properties.

The files for the Trader Agent  are in
$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/server_discovery.

For more instructions read the $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/server_discovery/README.
