Description
-----------

This directory contains a simple test in the form of a sender and a
receiver.  The test has the following features:

1.It tests the AVStreams Integration with the AQoSA API when compiled
and run with rapi=1. The test initiates an RSVP session between the
sender and receiver.

2.When rapi=0, that is, intserv is not used then it sets the diffserv
codepoint to 0x3f.

3. Shows a mechanism to pace data.

Running the test
----------------

If running with rapi=1 start the RSVP daemon(s).

The following is common irrespective of the rapi flag value.

The test must be run with the naming service.  Check the run_test.pl
to see how to configure the test case.

receiver
--------

receiver -f <output_filename>

-f <output_filename> -> The name of the file under which the received stream
                        data has to be stored (defaults to "output")

sender
------

sender [-f <filename>] [-p <protocol>] [-r <frame rate>] [-l <local_address>] [-a <peer_address>] [-d]


-f filename --> The file to be streamed to the receiver (defaults to
                "input").

-p protocol --> The protocol string sould be QoS_UDP if rapi=1 else it
                should be UDP,RTP/UDP, SCTP_SEQ (defaults to UDP).

-r framerate--> The rate at which tha data frames need to be sent
                (defaults to 30 frames per second).

-l address  --> Local address in the format host:port.

-a address  --> Destination address in the format host:port.

-d          --> Increament the TAO_debug_level for debug messages.
