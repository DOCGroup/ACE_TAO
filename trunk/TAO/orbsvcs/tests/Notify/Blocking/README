Notification Blocking Policy Test
================================

Description
-----------

This test exercises the event blocking policy of the Notification
Service.  The Blocking policy is not one of the policies defined in the
Notification Spec.  It is a feature requested by CISCO.

A number of events are sent by the supplier.  The supplier should begin to
block when the event queue begins to fill.  The supplier should then
continue to send events once the consumer catches up on the events that are
sent out.


Usage
-----

The test consists of a Structured_Supplier and Structured_Consumer.
The usage for each as is follows:

$ Structured_Supplier -\?
usage:  Structured_Supplier -o <iorfile> -e <# of events> -d

$ Structured_Consumer -\?
usage:  Structured_Consumer -k <ior> -e <expected events>
                            -t <relative blocking timeout seconds>


To run this test, just run the run_test.pl perl script.  It will run both
structured and sequence tests with each of the implemented discard policies.


Expected Results
----------------
The consumers of each type expect to only receive a certain number of
events.  If you see:

ERROR: too many events received.

then the test has failed.  Otherwise, the test was ok.
