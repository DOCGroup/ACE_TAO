This test is based on the Filter example.
It tests the persistent filter changes. The filter constraints
are saved to persistent data instead of filter IOR.

The run_test.pl starts NotificationService, consumer and supplier.
After they complete, restart them again with using the persistent
data. The restarted consumer and supplier will verify the filters
and modify the constraints. The test finally should pass with no
errors.
