Max Throughput of various configurations:
=========================================

To calculate the Maximum throughput possible, a supplier thread sends
events in a burst to a consumer.

This test runs the following configurations*:

1. 2 Hops    : A supplier sends events directly to a consumer.
2. 3 Hops    : A supplier sends events to a relay consumer
	       onto the final consummer.
3. Notify    : A supplier sends events via Cos Notification to a consumer.

4. Collocated: A supplier sends events via a collocated
	       RT Notification to a consumer.

[* Note that the payload is identical in all configurations.
Also beware that the priority values in these tests are for Linux.
These cannot be made portable as they do not use RTCORBA.]

The RTCORBA enabled versions of these tests are:

2_Hops_RTCORBA
3_Hops_RTCORBA
Notify_RTCORBA
Colocated_RTCORBA

Running the tests:
=================

Simply execute "perl run_all.pl" in this directory.
