                                                        ===========

Updates:
-------
This test will check if the subscription and publication update messages
from the event channel are properly received from the Notify Service.

Command line parameters:
none.

ConnectDisconnect:
-----------------
Connects/Disconnects consumers and suppliers in a loop to test connect
and disconnect to admin objects.

Command line parameters:
                     
"-count <testcount>",
"-consumers <number_of_consumers>",
"-suppliers <number_of_suppliers>",

LifeCycle:
-------------
Creates and destroys EC and Admin objects.

Command line parameters:
"-count testcount"

where <testcount> is how many times we want to create/destroy.  

IdAssignment:
------------
This test exercies Id generation by creating ec and admin objects and
using the assigned ids to lookup these objects and destroy them.

Command line parameters:                     
"-iter <count>", count is how many times to repeat this test.                    
"-ec_count <count>", count is number of ec objects to create 
"-ca_count <count>", count is number of consumer admin (ca) objects to create 
"-sa_count <count>\n", count is number of supplier admin (sa) objects to create 


AdminProperties
--------------------
Tests out the EC Admin QoSproperties:

command line parameters:

-max_queue_length [max_queue_length]
-max_consumers [max_consumers]
-max_suppliers [max_suppliers]
-reject_new_events [reject_new_events]
-consumers [consumers]
-suppliers [suppliers]
-event_count [event_count]
-ConsumerDelay [delay in secs] 
// sleep period per push for the consumer created to test MaxQueueLength
-InitialDelay [delay in secs]

Events:
----------
This test creates 1 structured supplier and 2 structured consumers. 
Each consumer should receive all the events send by the supplier.
The uses the default ConsumerAdmin and default Supplier Admin if the
-use_default_admin option is specified.
 
command line options:
-use_default_admin
-events [number of events to send]

MultiTypes:
-----------
Creates a Supplier and Consumer each for the 3 Client types that send
and receive Any, Structured and Sequence event types. 
Each type of the supplier then sends an event each to the Notification
channel. All 3 types of consumers should receive 3 events each. 

command line options:
none.

Simple:
-------
Creates 1 Any Supplier and 1 Any Consumer. Events received by the
supplier must be equal to the count send.

command line options:
-events [number of events to send] 

Filter:
------
Tests the FilterAdmin and Filter interface methods.

command line options:
none.

Sequence:
---------
In the default run, this test sends 15 events in batches of 5 events
via a sequence supplier. It sets the consumer's batch size to 3 and
sets a pacing interval of 2 seconds.  It checks to see if 15 events are indeed received.

command line options:
-events [count]
-SupplierBatchSize [count]
-ConsumerBatchSize [count]
-ConsumerDelay [delay]
-InitialDelay [delay]
