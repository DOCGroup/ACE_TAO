This test application exercises basic features of TAO's Naming
Service.  It behaves as follows:

        1. It obtains an object reference to a remote Naming
           Service (which currently must be handed started,
           but will ultimately be run in by a perl script).

        2. It binds(), resolves(), and unbinds() an object
           reference into the Naming Context.

We'll add more features to this test over time.
