This test application exercises basic features of TAO's Naming
Service.  It behaves as follows:

        1. It obtains an object reference to a remote Naming
           Service.  This currently must be handed started from
           the $TAO_ROOT/orsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service 
           program, but will ultimately be launched by a perl script.

        2. It binds(), resolves(), and unbinds() an object
           reference into the Naming Context.

We'll add more features to this test over time.
