This is a simple test for testing the multicast ior parser with format
mcast://multicast_address:port:nicaddress:ttl

The Client requests for the IOR of a service that is multicasted.
The Server helps get this ior with the use of the TAO_IOR_Multicast
class in the libTAO_Svc_Utils library.

It should test the nic address and ttl parts too of the mcast format.

You can run the test as:

% ./server -a 224.0.1.27:12345 -ORBEndpoint iiop://doc.ece.uci.edu:23456

	The '-a' option is to give the multicast address to which the
requests to the server should be directed to.

% ./client -ORBInitRef MCASTServer=mcast://224.0.1.27:12345:eth0:2/MCASTServer
