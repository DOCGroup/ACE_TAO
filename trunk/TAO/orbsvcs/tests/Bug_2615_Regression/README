This test provides regression coverage for bug tao397.

The server installs a server request interceptor and persistent servant and writes out a vanilla IOR and an IOGR for itself.
The client installs client side FT support and invokes the method "has_ft_request_service_context" on the IOR and then the IOGR.
The server request interceptor indicates back to the client via the return value of the method if a FT request service context was transmitted.
The client expects a context to have been sent *iff* the request was made on the IOGR.
