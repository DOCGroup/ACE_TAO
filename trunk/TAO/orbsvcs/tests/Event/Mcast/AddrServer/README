Real-Time Event Service Address Server test

This directory contains a simple test intended to be run manually across
hosts of different architectures. The server reports the IP address served
as does the client. These should match.

To run the server:

./server -o <ior_file>

To run the client:
./client -k file://<ior_file>

Default IOR file is ./as.ior

There is no run_test.pl script as this test is only interesting when run
across multiple hosts.
