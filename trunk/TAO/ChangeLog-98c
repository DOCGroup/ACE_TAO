Wed Jul 15 15:44:10 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Invocation.cpp: Carlos corrected his omission of code to
          invoke before waiting for a reply.

Wed Jul 15 12:40:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Connect.{h,cpp}: Changed handle_input and send_request
	  of the Client Connection Handler to support global
	  resources and multiple threads. It is achieved through
	  the leader follower model.

	* tao/Invocation.cpp: The suspended Client Connection Handler
	  from Connect.cpp get resumed (TAO_GIOP_Invocation::invoke).

	* tao/ORB.{h,cpp}: The run method conforms to the rules
	  of the leader follower model.

	* tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}: The ORB Core now supports all
	  the variables for the leader follower model.

Wed Jul 15 12:07:15 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/Servant_Base.cpp: 
	  Added timeprobes in operation lookup.

	* tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp: 
	* tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp: 
	  Added TIMEPROBE_PRINT at the end.

Wed Jul 15 12:11:01 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/tests/Property/Makefile: 
		Removed unnecessary STL dependencies.

Wed Jul 15 11:44:57 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/Makefile: Removed STL stuff and
	did a make depend.

Wed Jul 15 10:55:33 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/run_tests.pl: removed hard-coded perl path.

Tue Jul 14 21:50:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/run_test.sh: use sh instead of ksh, $login
          instead of mk1, and $ps_opts.

        * orbsvcs/tests/start_services: bash doesn't always supply $USER,
          so use $login with it also.

Tue Jul 14 21:25:19 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        These tests now copmile with egcs. In addition, Added modify and
        withdraw_using_constraint tests, and the "quiet" flag, which will
        staunch the usual barrage of output by not printing the contents
        of offers and service types.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.cpp: compiles with
        egcs.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/*.*: Compiles with egcs. Improved the
        modify method.

Tue Jul 14 19:15:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          The Event Channel modules are constructed using a Factory class,
          that will simplify configuration of the EC, like using RTU or
          FIFO dispatching, disabling correlation, or filtering, etc.

Tue Jul 14 18:35:56 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_unbounded_sequence_ch.cpp:
          The generated replace() method released the buffer twice.

Tue Jul 14 15:56:46 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Machine_Properties.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Property_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
	  Removed as they are moved to
	  orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Makefile: 
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/server.{h,cpp}: 
	  Removed as they are outdated.

Tue Jul 14 15:28:44 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/field_ch.cpp:
          Added support for arrays inside structures. Anonymous arrays do
          *not* work. Thanks to Eric Powers <powerg@deltanet.com> for this
          patch.

Tue Jul 14 14:40:36 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp (print_stats):
          when short-circuiting, don't print out time breakdowns to/in/from EC.

Tue Jul 14 13:30:01 1998  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.h:

        Added conditional compilation logic to cause EC to use dynamic queues
        with appropriate dispatching strategies when the MUF, EDF, or MLF
        strategies are defined.  This is a temporary measure to allow
        testing of the EC performance with the dynamic queues, and will
        be relaced with a better configuration mechanism, based on the results
        of the off-line scheduling run, in the very near future.

Tue Jul 14 12:00:18 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/be_interface.cpp:
          Added server side support for CORBA::Object::_non_existent, in
          the future it could be implemented in the POA, saving an
          operation lookup and reducing the footprint somewhat.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSet.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSet.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSetFactory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSetFactory.cpp:
          Replaced ACE_Thread_Mutex with ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so it compiles in
          platforms without threads, not that it will work though.

Tue Jul 14 12:30:45 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (do_priority_inversion_test):
          removed dependence on local context_switch on platforms that don't
          have ACE_HAS_PRUSAGE_T and ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE.  Thanks to
          Arturo Montes" <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.  Also,
          removed csw on those platforms, because it was no longer being used.

Tue Jul 14 11:48:23 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp} (arl_same_port_connect):  Added the new
          member function to ORB_Core to check if we want the client to
          initiate a connection using the same local port number as
          server's.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (start): Added code to specify the following:

          This change is only for ARL only and to enable the feature, you
          must add

             #if defined (TAO_ARL_USES_SAME_CONNECTOR_PORT)

          to your $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h.  Add the command line option

             -ORBarlsameportconnect yes

          when starting the client.

          *** This is not for the general audience of TAO.  Don't use
          it. ***

Tue Jul 14 11:34:02 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp (do_static_call): commented out unused
          local "status".

Mon Jul 13 18:35:22 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          Code generation for sequences of octets was incorrect in
          platforms that do not support automatic template
          instantiation. Thanks to Eric Powers <powerg@deltanet.com> for
          pointing this out.

Mon Jul 13 17:50:35 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:  Added Invocation.cpp into project.


        The following two changes were made per Carlos' instructions.
        (I was just typing.)

        * tao/deep_free.cpp (DEEP_FREE): Commented out 'delete source' in
          case of CORBA::tk_struct.

        * tao/Any.cpp (operator=, ~CORBA_Any, replace): Added delete
          this->value after DEEP_FREEing.

Mon Jul 13 17:37:01 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Fixed some problems in the implementation of _non_existent(),
          thanks to Dave Meyer <dmeyer@std.saic.com>

Mon Jul 13 16:20:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp:
          On the client side we can optimize memory allocation for
          oneway requests by not allocating the response
          buffer. But to do this and take as much memory as possible from
          the stack also requires to follow different execution paths for
          the oneway vs. two way tests.
          With this changes the memory allocations are:
          + For oneways:
            1 on the client side (can be TSS allocator).
            3 on the server side (one can be TSS allocator).
          + For twoway:
            3 on the client side (1 can be a TSS allocator).
            3 on the server side (1 can be TSS allocator).


        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl:

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
          Added simple tests with no arguments or return values, also
          added a oneway test.

        * tests/Thruput/TAO/Makefile:
          The new files in the tao library changed the dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Makefile:
          Sources were listed in the wrong macro.

Mon Jul 13 14:37:06 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Event_Latency.cpp: use ACE_CU64_TO_CU32 to convert const
          64-bit u_ints to 32-bits happily with Sun C++.  Also, replaced
          a function-style cast and some other old casts with ACE
          ANSI-style casts.

Mon Jul 13 13:59:08 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl:
          Fixed a few (minor) perl warnings.

Mon Jul 13 11:49:29 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Marshall.i: Now setting freed string pointer to zero.

        * tao/deep_free.cpp: Although the struct fields were being freed,
        the memory for the struct itself wasn't. Note: other types may
        also have this problem.

Sun Jul 12 19:47:34 1998  Seth Widoff  <sbw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/trader.html:
        Finished the initial draft of the Trading Service documentation.

Sun Jul 12 13:45:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/MT_Client_Test/*:
          Added a new test for testing multiple threads accessing
          global resources, which means, one ORB and one Reactor.
          It also tests for proper nested upcalls.

Sun Jul 12 01:40:58 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Fixed several problems reported by John Mulhern
          <9107@mn3.lawson.lawson.com>, that fix portability problems to
          HP/aCC.

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Declared a temporary buffer as CORBA::Octet* instead of void*,
          otherwise HP/aCC balks.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_sequence.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          fe_add_sequence() was redefined with different arguments and
          return value. It was not the intention and it triggered warnings
          on several compilers (HP/aCC, SGI/CC).

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp:
          Removed indent pragma.
          Declared tao_yyerror as taking a const char*, it is not used
          anyway.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/tie_si.cpp:
          Tie delegation is similar to collocated upcalls, the arguments
          are T_ptr objects and not T_var, hence, no .in () calls are
          needed.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_extern.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          Changed old C-style cast to reinterpret_cast, that should make
          HP/aCC compiler happy. This is just because SunCFE uses File* as
          a compilation barrier for FILE*, IMHO a waste of time.

Sat Jul 11 10:17:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile:
          Added EC_Mcast to the list of tests.

Fri Jul 10 22:25:44 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          Added the first implementation of a UDP/Mcast based gateway to
          the EC. The current classes require a lot of manual
          configuration.
          Also implemented a small test to show the usage.

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Give access to external users of the swap_<n> methods, also
          provide an accesor for the byte swapping flag in OutputCDRs.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
          Use the new byte swap accessor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          Completed support for gateways that are interested in the
          supplier list changes. It is now possible to add Gateways
          *after* the consumer or supplier list has stabilized.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp:
          Do nothing if receive a supplier update.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          Destroy the Event Channel *after* the consumers unsubscribe from
          it.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
          Before a normal exit we unbind the Event Service (and, if local,
          the Scheduling Service) from the Naming Service.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:
        Addressed a number of memory leaks in the Trading
        Service. However, typecodes still leak oodles of memory.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.cpp:
        Cleans self up properly after catching SIGINT.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TT_Info.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.cpp:

          Made some changes - not done yet. DII test still doesn't work.

Fri Jul 10 15:32:42 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Another pass.

Fri Jul 10 12:21:18 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          Fixed errors and warnings reported by David.

Fri Jul 10 00:32:51 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/vardecl_ss.cpp:
          The skeletons were not releasing the strings allocated while
          demarshalling the arguments.

        * docs/implrepo.html:
          Another pass at the design document.

Thu Jul 09 23:02:48 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp (create_internal_lock): Change method to watch out
          for platforms without threads.  Thanks to Hongyin Quan
          <hq1@arl.wustl.edu> for pointing this out.

Thu Jul  9 17:48:37 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Carlos's comments have been addressed.

Thu Jul  9 15:12:35 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/deep_free.cpp: wasn't freeing string fields of structs.

        * tests/Quoter/Makefile: removed STL vestige.

Wed Jul  8 21:08:53 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html:
          Quick revision and added comments with remaining issues.

Wed Jul  8 19:01:02 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Another big revision of the paper.

Wed Jul  8 17:13:00 1998  Jeff Parsons  <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.h,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsw,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.cpp,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.dsp,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/README,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile:
          Combined client.h and client.cpp into one file,
          initialized the return variables in all the Cubit
          operations (to get rid of some UMRs in Purify),
          removed the one-button test file DII_Cubit_Test.cpp
          and the corresponding project file in VC (the perl
          script does the same thing and more safely), updated
          the DII_Cubit.dsw, Makefile and README files.

Tue Jul  8 14:00:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: When changing the RtecEventComm.id
          file or the RtecScheduler.idl file, it is needed to
          recompile the RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl file. This is a common
          problem. So the programmer has to take care that the
          dependencies in the Makefile or VC++ project file
          are set properly.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java.JDK1.2,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README:
          Simplified the event data.

Tue Jul  7 22:11:17 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
          Fixed DEC cxx errors, addressed a memory leak.

Tue Jul  7 20:48:37 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.{h,cpp}:  Revert my previous changes.

Tue Jul  7 19:47:15 198   Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/Request.cpp: Slight modification (Andy's
          suggestion) to send_oneway (), getting rid of an
          error message when shutting down the Cubit server
          via DII.

Tue Jul  7 19:25:55 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.cpp:
          New file that implements a "one-button" DII Cubit test.
        * DII_Cubit/Makefile: Added a build for dii_cubit_test.exe.
        * DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.dsp: New project in the workspace.
        * DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsw: Updated workspace (new project).

Tue Jul 07 07:36:36 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: use #if 0 instead of // to comment out a
          multiline #define, to avoid warning about a multiline comment.

        * tests/Param_Test/results.{h,cpp}: added trailing $ to Id string.

Mon Jul  6 19:33:54 1998  Jeff Parsons  <jp4@cs.wustl,edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
          Made the shutdown request DII instead of SII. Everything
          works on NT except for the shutdown option. Unix is OK.
          Also, changed the parse_args call to come after initializing
          the orb, so other orb-specific args can be used and not
          confuse parse_args.

Mon Jul  6 19:17:00 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

Mon Jul  6 17:00:00 1998  Jeff Parsons   <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.{h,cpp}:
          Added a DII request on the naming service to get the
          Cubit factory IOR, plus code to implement all the
          command line options. Built with SunCC, it works on Unix,
          but not yet on NT.

Mon Jul  6 15:46:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Strings contain a nested CDR with the bounds for it, the
          demarshalling code in that case was invoking the TypeCode
          constructor with the wrong parameters, hence the bounds were
          invalid.  The problem only shows up now because we were ignoring
          the bounds in previous releases.

Mon Jul  6 15:24:21 1998  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cec.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logger/client.h
        * tests/Logger/client.cpp

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Logger.idl

          Routine checkin. Ignore the man behind that curtain....
          Fully working version complete, but not yet Purified.

Mon Jul 06 15:13:11 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/initguid.h: Reordered some stuff.

        * tao/corba.h: Don't include in "compat/initguid.h" anymore.

Mon Jul  6 15:10:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Data.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          The CDR size was wrong, this resulted in all kind of strange
          errors n the client side. This is another reminder that an octet
          sequence only uses a single Message_Block, not a chain of them.

Mon Jul 06 14:58:14 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Object.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/Server_Request.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Renamed REFIID to TAO_REFIID and
          DEFINE_GUID to TAO_DEFINE_GUID to avoid conflict with MSVC's
          COM.  We don't support COM at this moment.

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Disable the definition of TAO_VARENUM.  It
          is not used currently.  Thanks to Maximilian Hoferer
          <mhoferer@krones.de> for noticing this.

Mon Jul 06 09:07:36 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{i cpp}: Removed redundant preprocessing token
          concatentations - HP-UX aCC warned about them.

        * tao/Connect.h: Added #include "tao/corba.h" so the defs are visible
          at template instantiation on AIX xlC.

Mon Jul  6 04:45:02 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.h (TAO_Client_Connect_Handler): Added a new data
          member <reactive_> to trace whether this client connection is
          running reactively or in a separate thread (other than the main
          thread.)

        * tao/Connect.cpp (open,close,send_request): Check to see if the
          client is going to run in a separate thread (by comparing its
          thread id with that of reactor's.)  If so, the handler won't try
          to register itself with the reactor and simply block on the
          socket IO calls.  This change enables the NestedUpcall/Reactor
          example to use the thread-per-connection strategy.

Sun Jul  5 21:22:42 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Undid the change I made on July 3.  Although it
          fixed the one problem I was looking at, it broke everything
          else.  Oops.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: Changed the TAO_EXPORT_MACRO
          definition to override any that came before.  Without this the
          ordering of includes (putting corba.h before an orbsvc, such as
          CosNamingC.h) would break in certain configurations.  Also moved
          it after the includes so it shouldn't affect included files.

Sat Jul  4 01:18:21 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Interpreter.cpp:

          Addressed warnings/errors on IRIX.

Fri Jul 03 21:51:44 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp (parse_args):
          reset n_suppliers_ to 1, if <= 0, before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN
          instead of after.  (supplier_task): cast event_count_ to
          CORBA::ULong to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp (push_consumer):
          commented out unused local "ID".

Fri Jul  3 19:54:03 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Changed the TAO_NAMESPACE_STORAGE_CLASS macros to
          work better with namespaces on MSVC.

Fri Jul  3 18:40:46 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:
          Debugged and tested directed queries.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Importer.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/import_test.cpp:
          Added code to test directed queries.

Fri Jul 03 17:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README: Added more documentation.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java: Register
          now only for notification events.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/AnyAnalyser.{h,cpp}: support time stamps.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/DOVEMIB.{h,cpp}: support time stamps.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/PrintVisitor.{h,cpp}: support time stamps

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.{h, cpp}: moved
          a lot of connection management into the new DOVE Supplier.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.dsp: Added the DOVE
          Suplier files.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{h,cpp}: All
          the connection management with the event service is done here.
          A standardized interface is now supported, thanks to
          Kevin Stanley <kstanley1@mdc.com>.

Fri Jul 03 16:38:12 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/Sequence.h (TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<CORBA::Octet>) Removed the
          template type specification from constructor names so that this
          compiles on AIX xlC as well as Sun C++ and HPUX aCC.

Fri Jul 03 13:58:08 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.37 released.

Fri Jul  3 13:05:01 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Data.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
          Fixed template instantiations.

Fri Jul 03 11:36:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile,
          tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: disabled perfect
          hashing until we can stabilize its use.

Fri Jul 03 11:34:38 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:
          Added new object files to the Makefile.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp:
          Protected against null publication or subscription list.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          Removed a possible race condition in consumer
          disconnections. Thanks to Thomas Venturella <tventurell@mdc.com>
          for the last two fixes.

Fri Jul 03 08:40:28 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/corba.h: Reordered some includes to get it to compile clean on
          HP-UX aCC.

Fri Jul 03 02:03:23 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

          Added MSVC++ project files for the new test.

        * tao/CDR.h:
          Fixed typo in a extraction operator for InputCDR and strings, it
          was declared as operator>>.

          Added code to sort by preference the merged result sequence of a
          federated query.

Thu Jul  2 19:41:46 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: Added TAO_IDLFLAGS -P to enable
          Perfect-hashed-operation-lookup strategy for the idl compiler.

Thu Jul  2 19:22:24 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
          This test shows how to use the EC for custom marshalling, later
          it will be adapted to measure throughput in the EC.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/RtecEventComm.idl:
          Added some padding so the payload (an encapsulated CDR) is
          always properly aligned.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/README:
        * docs/releasenotes/ec.html:
          Included some info about this new test.

Thu Jul  2 14:28:01 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp: We were generating incorrect code for
        the out () and _retn () methods of the Array_var class.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Missing #include for Process.h added.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: Ran make depend

        * tests/Param_Test/README: Added description for the array tests.

Thu Jul  2 12:36:28 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader[_T].{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Visitors.{h,cpp}:
          For the 'in' operator in the standard OMG constraint language, the
          Constraint Interpreter needs to identify and extract from Anys
          sequences of primitive types, regardless of how many times the
          sequence has been typedef'd. Added code to do this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TTest.idl:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TT_Info.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Exporter.cpp:
          Now sends aliased sequences to the Trader to test the above
          enhancement.

Thu Jul  2 12:29:10 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        The Next round of changes for GPERF + TAO_IDL integration. NT
        related stuff have been taken care of. attributes also should work
        now.
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp:

Thu Jul 02 09:17:57 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/CDR/growth.cpp (main),
          tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (run): replaced
          ACE_hrtime_t-to-ACE_INT32 static casts with ACE_U64_TO_U32
          for compatibility with ACE_U_LongLong.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/Triangle_Test/Object_A_Impl.cpp: added
          newline at end of file.

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/Servant_Locator.cpp (postinvoke):
          added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (my_servant) to avoid compile warning about
          unused variable with ACE_NDEBUG.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/Task_Client (run_tests): use
          ACE_OS::fprintf instead of fprintf, and fixed the format
          specifier to match the argument type.

        * Makefile (release): use $(MAKE) instead of make for
          recursive make.

Thu Jul 02 01:50:58 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA: Renamed TAO_POA_Locking to Synchronization.  Also
          renamed the related enums to not use the USE_ prefix.

Wed Jul  1 22:42:13 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTrading.idl:
          Merged Sequences.idl into CosTrading.idl.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
          Addressed DEC cxx warnings/errors. Hopefully solved some, probbaly
          introduced more.

Wed Jul 01 21:14:11 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/any.cpp: commented out unused static
          any_table.

        * tests/Param_Test/fixed_array.cpp (check_validity): commented
          out unused local ret.

        * tests/Param_Test/{bd,ub}_str_seq.cpp (init_parameters):
          commented out unused local gen.

Wed Jul  1 19:20:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Makefile: I hopefully
          fixed the complains of the DEC cxx compiler.

Wed Jul  1 15:50:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Fixed a memory leak in the initial
          references code. The pointers (name_service_ and trading_service_)
          were not properly reused and not properly released.

        * tao/Operation_Table.h: Fixed a spelling problem with
          TAO_operation_db_entry.

Wed Jul  1 13:59:30 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/LifeCycle_Service/Makefile: Removed STL flags.

        * tao/TAO.{h,cpp}: Passing in argc to the TAO_ORB_Manager by
          reference, since ORB_init takes argc by reference.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Makefile:
          Made Trading Service app resemble other orbsvcs apps. Accepts -TS*
          command line arguments. Has the ability to form a complete graph
          federation with other traders on the same multicast network.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Importer.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/export_test.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makfile:
          export_test will now export service types and offers to all
          traders linked to the multicast-enabled trader, so import_test
          will test federated queries.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.{h,cpp}: Added an init method for
          initialization outside the constructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Changed macro name from
          TAO_HAS_DYNAMIC_PROPERTY_BUG to TAO_HAS_OBJECT_IN_STRUCT_MARSHAL_BUG.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/*.*:
          o  Hopefully fixed DEC cxx errors/warnings.
          o  Added command-line configuration of trader policies, interfaces,
             and multithreading support.
          o  Debugged link interface and federated queries.
          o  Added explicit template specialization.

Wed Jul  1 1:55:23 1998 Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile: It works, at least with
          SunCC. It builds the DII client and also the IDL server if
          necessary (since we run it before running client.exe) -thanks
          to David Levine for that.
        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.h, cpp: Now builds and
          executes on Unix and NT. Also added some macros for the
          environment checking inside the operations.

Wed Jul  1 10:28:07 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h (be_type): Fixed the warnings
          in g++.

Wed Jul  1 06:36:11 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/any_op_cs.cpp: For the copying
          version of the <<= operator, we were not doing a copy. Thanks to
          Seth Widoff for pointing this out.

Tue Jun 30 22:08:38 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (lookup_strategy): added full
          qualification of TAO_CodeGen::LOOKUP_STRATEGY return type.

Tue Jun 30 18:27:49 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.i:
          Another ACE_CAST_CONST problem, thanks to Seth Widoff
          (sbw1@cs.wustl.edu) for catching this one.

Tue Jun 30 18:21:04 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/Makefile:
          Removed STL includes --- no longer needed for Trading Service.

Tue Jun 30 16:50:12 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        First round of changes for GPERF + TAO_IDL integration. Execute
        tao_idl with -P option to enable PERFECT_HASH operation lookup
        strategy.

        IDL-Attributes are not supported yet.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp: Added option -P to enable
          PERFECT_HASH operation lookup strategy.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h: Added methods to generate
          perfect hashing operation lookup table in the server skeleton
          code.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h (class TAO_OutStream): Added a
          new stream type GPERF_INPUT to indicate the outstream is for
          gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h (class TAO_CodeGen):  Added <enum
          LOOKUP_STRATEGY {...}> to indicate various lookup
          strategies. Added the member and access methods that keeps track
          of the TAO_OutStream that corresponds to the gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Included "ace/Process.h".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

        * tao/Operation_Table.h (TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable):
        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp :
          Defined the class TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable, the factory
          class for Perfect_Hashing-Operation_Lookup strategy.

Tue Jun 30 13:23:59 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          Workaround Sun/CC problem when compiling with -O (but not
          -fast). Apparently it does not like to use static (file) scope
          symbols in the definition of a template.

Tue Jun 30 10:40:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/configurations.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

        * tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.{h,cpp}: Added the create_iiop_profile_lock (void)

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Use ACE_Lock instead of ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.h: Changed the forward profile lock to a pointer to a lock.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.i: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}: Added the parsing of "-ORBportiiopproflielock" to
          the parse_args method. "thread" (default) means to use a mutex lock
          on the access of the forwarding iiop profile. "null" means, use a null
          mutex, which is faster, but does not provide any protection.
          Added also the function create_iiop_profile_lock () to allow
          others to create a new lock, depending on the above mentioned switch.

Tue Jun 30 00:58:57 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.36 released.

Mon Jun 29 14:43:17 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp (gen_forany_defn): changed
          declaration of friend CORBA::Any to friend class CORBA_Any,
          to keep DEC cxx from complaining.  Also, commented out
          the declaration, because it doesn't appear to be necessary.

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): cast sizeof to int
          to avoid egcs warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Jun 29 11:05:03 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Removed unused variable.

Mon Jun 29 11:00:26 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

          After the call to do_static_call, we were not checking if some
          exception was raised. This was causing major problems if there was
          any post do_static_call processing such as narrowing to be
          done. Thanks to Seth Widoff for reporting the problem.

Sun Jun 28 21:33:48 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: replaced ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX with
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that it will compile with g++
          (and be correct :-).

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): changed loop index
          i from u_int to int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Sun Jun 28 16:10:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/Triangle_Test/Makefile: Added
          this Makefile for use on Unix machines.

Sun Jun 28 15:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: In method location_forwarding, removed
          the explicit release of the IIOP_Object. It is implicitly
          released by the release of the CORBA::OBject pointer.

        * tests/Quoter/Generic_Factory_Impl.{h,cpp}: Splitted
          the create_object method into two parts.

Sat Jun 27 18:13:05 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): Changed
          #include "ace/Timeprobes.h" to #include "tao/Timeprobes.h".
