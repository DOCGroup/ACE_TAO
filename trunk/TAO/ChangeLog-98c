Mon Jul 20 18:17:02 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

	* docs/releasenotes/index.html: Updated the IDL compiler entry
	(GPERF-IDL integration).

Mon Jul 20 17:51:01 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterators.h:
	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.h:
	* orbsvcd/tests/Trading/import_test.cpp:
	  Fixed another g++ linker error and one compile-time error.

Mon Jul 20 17:30:49 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (gen_perfect_hash_methods): Changed
	the absolute path for gperf to $ACE/bin. 

Mon Jul 20 16:55:54 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (copy_ctor_helper):
	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_sh.cpp (visit_interface):
	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp (visit_interface):
	* TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h (copy_ctor_helper):
	  To alleviate the g++ linker's confusion in the face of profuse
	  virtual inheritence in the skeletons, the IDL compiler now
	  explicitly generates a copy constructor in each skeleton
	  class. The copy constructor calls the copy constructor of each
	  superclass in the skeleton's inheritence hierarchy.
	
Mon Jul 20 15:08:11 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

	* TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp (DRV_parse_args):  Added a "#if
	!defined (ACE_HAS_GPERF)" so that IDL Compiler will use Dynamic
	Hashing if gperf is not found but -P option is specified.

	* TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp (gen_perfect_hash_methods): Fixed
	the ACE_Process' command line to use absolute path
	<$ACE/apps/gperf/src/gperf>.

Mon Jul 20 13:00:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: 
	* tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client_i.h: 
	* tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client_i.cpp: 
	  Added options to just run the VOID or the ONEWAY test.

Mon Jul 20 12:27:29 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

	* docs/releasenotes/index.html:
	  Added a reference to trader.html in the Trading Service portion
	  of the releasenotes. 

	* docs/releasenotes/trader.html:
	  Minor editorial changes to the trader documentation.

Mon Jul 20 11:46:04 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tao/corba.h: 
	  TAO_THROW_SPEC is a little different than ACE_THROW_SPEC, not
	  only we need support for exceptions in the platform, we also
	  would need them in the IDL compiler.
	  Plus it gives a lot of warnings in MSVC++ 5.0

Mon Jul 20 11:15:52 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

	* orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.cpp:
          Eliminated superfluous template instantiation  
	  ACE_Unbounded_Queue<CosTrading::Admin::OctetSeq>.
	
Mon Jul 20 10:57:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

      * tao/Connect.cpp: Changed the handle_locate method completely
        to try to upcall to the non_existent method. This method
        is not part of the standard, is TAO internal. We know
        that this method is supported by each TAO Object. So
        if we fail we know the object is not there. If we succeed,
        the object is available and if we get forward_request
        exception we will forward the call.

      * tao/IIOP_Object.{h,i,cpp}: Added code to branch to do a conditonal
        locate request, depending on two flags. One tells to 
        use it at all the other tells if it is the first call- 
        because we want to do it only on the first call.

      * tao/Invocation.{h,i,cpp}: Added code to the start method,
        which branches into different CDR stream generation,
        depending on the kind of message we want to send. The two
        options right now are: Request and LocateRequest.
        A new subclass has been introduces: TAO_GIOP_
        LocateRequest_Invocation, which is similar to the
        Twoway subclass but does a locate request. It has its own
        invoke method and does not call the common invoke method.
        Closing of a connection is the same in all the three cases
        (oneway, twoway, locate_request), I factored the code out
        into a close_connection method.

      * tao/Object.{h,cpp}: Added a method call to activate
        the locate request on the first call after the activation.
        The locate request will be done only once unless it is activated
        a second time.

      * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp: Changed
        the code generation of the non_existent method. It accepts
        only one parameter, not two. So I changed the param_count 
        from 2 to 1.


Mon Jul 20 10:35:33 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Interpreter.{h,cpp},
          Offer_Iterators_T.cpp:
          wrapped TAO_THROW_SPEC arguments with double parens.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterators.h: moved = 0 (for pure
          virtual) to after the exceptions spec.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.cpp,Trader_Utils.cpp:
          fixed exceptions specs to match declarations in .h files.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TT_Info.cpp (dump_properties): changed
          types of locals "seq_length" and "i" from CORBA::ULong to
          CORBA::Long to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Jul 20 10:20:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/index.html: Added a reference to the
          global resources and leader-follower model documentation.

        * docs/leader_follower.html: Documentation about the leader-follower
          model used for global resources, especially for one Reactor
          accessed by multiple threads.

Mon Jul 20 06:52:02 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_array/{array_ch, array_ci, array_cs}.cpp:
        Added support for anonymous arrays. This is yet to be tested

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/field_ch.cpp: Handled anonymous
        array declaration in structures.

        *Note* that although the above changes were made a couple of weeks
        back I have not been able to test them.

Sun Jul 19 22:58:45 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.cpp: added
          ACE_Unbounded_Queue<CosTrading::Admin::OctetSeq *>, etc., template
          instantiations.

        * tao/corba.h: define TAO_THROW_SPEC using ACE_THROW_SPEC.

Sat Jul 18 23:01:51 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.40 released.

Sat Jul 18 22:16:14 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.39 released.

Sat Jul 18 20:22:19 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/run_test.sh: Removed this file,
          all the functionality is provided by the
          run_test.pl script.

        * tao/Server_Request.{h,cpp}: Added a new constructor,
          which does not need an input CDR stream. It is going
          to be used for locate requests. When we invoke
          the non_existend method on the object to see if it
          is there, forwarded or not existent.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java.JDK1.2:
          Adopted to the new interfaces for the Event Service.

Sat Jul 18 19:37:19 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp: The ORB now looks
          at argv and argc before the client does.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/run_test.pl: New Perl script
          for testing.

Sat Jul 18 17:31:29 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/Hardpack/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl:
        * tests/Cubit/Hardpack/IDL_Cubit/cubit_impl.{hh,cc}:
        * tests/Cubit/Hardpack/IDL_Cubit/client_i.{h,cpp}:
        * tests/Cubit/Hardpack/IDL_Cubit/server_i.{h,cpp}:

        * tests/Cubit/Hardpack/IDL_Cubit/initref.cfg:
                Added these files for the IDL_Cubit test for the Hardpack
        ORB.

Sat Jul 18 15:44:59 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Visitors.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Database.*:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Offer_Iterators.*:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Makefile:

        Fixed g++ 2.7.2 compilation warnings/errors. Note: the tests and
        applications, although they compile now with g++ 2.7.2, don't link
        properly because the g++ linker is baffled by the profuse
        virtual/multiple inheritance in the skeletons generated from the
        CosTrading.idl file, and can't find the copy constructors it
        autogenerated. The solution is to have the IDL compiler generate
        explicit copy constructors for these skeleton classes.

Sat Jul 18 15:39:42 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.dsp: Updated this MSVC
          project file to use the latest changes to the Simple
          Naming test.

Sat Jul 18 15:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/forwarding.html: Added some optimization
          suggestions.

Sat Jul 18 14:19:48 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTrading.idl:
        Moved the definition of TAO_HAS_OBJECT_IN_STRUCT_MARSHAL_BUG into
        orbconf.h and CosTrading.idl, and out of the orbsvcs Makefile.

Sat Jul 18 14:12:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf: Added the
          ORBiiopprofilelock switch to the client configuration to
          switch off the lock needed for forwarding. We know, we
          do not need it, so we use a null lock instead. This
          should improve the performance a little bit.

        * tao/Connect.cpp: Added code for handle_locate, which is still
          commented, because not tested.
          The TAO_ORB_Core_instance is now cached in send_request and
          handle_input.

Sat Jul 18 14:00:38 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: Always try to
          generate perfect hash functions for the operation
          dispatching by enabling the -P flag.

Sat Jul 18 11:29:43 1998  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.h
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp

          Changed to always typedef ACE_ES_QUEUE as the base
          template class ACE_Message_Queue<ACE_SYNCH> and
          explicitly construct dynamic message queues as needed.

Sat Jul 18 10:19:37 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Logger/client.cpp (nesting_test): added return 0
          at end. (init): removed unused local factory_ref2.

Sat Jul 18 08:19:24 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@lambada.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming/client.cpp: Beefed up this test so
          that it illustrates how to bind(), resolve(), and unbind() an
          object reference to a remote Naming Context.  This is an
          important test to make sure that things are working properly.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils: Added an init() method to
          this class to begin to factor out common code for being a client
          of a Naming Service.

        * TAO/orbsvcs/tests/Naming/ns_tree.cpp (main): Cleaned up the
          formatting for this test.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simple_Naming: Renamed clnt.* to client.* to
          be more consistent.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/svc.conf: Changed the default ORB
          concurrency model from reactive to thread-per-connection since
          the latter is considerably faster.

Fri Jul 17 17:42:27 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Added documentation for the TAO environment
          variables.

        * tao/ORB.cpp (resolve_trading_service): Changed the environment
          variable for NameService and TradingService to NameServiceIOR
          and TradingServiceIOR to be more consistent.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.h: Started adding the new
          TAO_Naming_Client class, which will simplify the initialization
          and access to a NamingContext.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Naming/Naming_Utils.cpp: Changed the
          capitalization of GetNamingContext() to get_naming_context(),
          which is consistent w/TAO programming style.

        * tao/skip.cpp: Replaced uses of old-style C casts with a
          static_cast.

Fri Jul 17 19:34:11 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: The return value for acceptor ().enable () is no
          longer being checked for -1, since platforms that don't
          support it (like NT) will return -1.

Fri Jul 17 18:46:17 1998  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cec.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.h: Added new fields for verbosity
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp: Adjusted for new fields
        * orbsvcs/tests/client.h: Added new methods- resolve_name () &
          nesting_test ()
        * orbsvcs/tests/client.cpp: Compacted code somewhat. Broke run () and
          init () into smaller functions
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Logger.idl: Adjusted TAO_MAXLOGMSGLEN
        * orbsvcs/tests/server.cpp: Partialy incomplete incorporation of
          name service

Fri Jul 17 17:58:37 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Addressed some more comments.

Fri Jul 17 11:47:42 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp (do_static_call,put_params): on sparcs
          with g++ prior to 2.8, e.g., 2.7.2.3, only; added an awful
          hack to two-way va_arg processing.  The hack throws away
          the first var arg.  Apparently, g++ 2.7.2.3 provides a bogus
          arg to the first va_arg call by mistake.  This ugliness
          works around that problem.  We haven't seen this elsewhere
          with va_arg, or with later versions of g++.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp:
          fixed supplier id (it was the same for all suppliers) and other
          very minor cleanup.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/run_tests.sh: added.

Fri Jul 17 11:02:29 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAC.h: unclosed comments.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/source/mpeg/server/augmented_server.{h,cpp}:
        Updated these files in light of recent changes to the Trading Service.

Fri Jul 17 09:46:56 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POAC.h: Replaced #endif // ... with #endif /* ... */ since
          this is more portable...

        * tao/POAC.h: Changed CORBA::Policy to ACE_CORBA_1 (Policy) to
          work around friggin' bugs with MSVC++ 4.2.  Thanks to Ernesto
          Guisado <eguisado@saincotrafico.com> for reporting this.

Fri Jul 17 08:28:55 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES): added TAO-inheritance.{pdf,ps}.gz
          to distribution.

Thu Jul 16 15:20:12 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
        * tao/ORB.cpp:
          Set the close-on-exec flag using the new IPC_SAP interfaces.

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp:

          Use ACE_SYNCH_CONDITION instead of
          ACE_Condition<ACE_Thread_Mutex> some template instantiations are
          removed.

Thu Jul 16 15:15:46 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        Trading Service now compiles by default! Let the mayhem begin!

Thu Jul 16 12:55:54 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.cpp:
          Added the close-on-exec flag the Client and Server
          Connection_Handlers, this avoid resource leaks in the event of
          fork/execs.

Thu Jul 16 12:57:08 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Fixed explicit template instantiation of
        ACE_Thread_Condition and ACE_Condition on IRIX.

Thu Jul 16 11:50:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}: Due to merging a cvs branch
          to the main trunk, the following changes went away, and
          where now reintroduced:

Thu Jul 16 00:00:20 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Removed all the COM madness, TAO no longer uses the IUnknown
          classes, QueryInterface(), AddRef() or Release(). The new
          reference counting methods are called _incr_refcnt and
          _decr_refcnt (the leading underscore is necessary for CORBA
          complaince, but it breaks ANSI/C or ANSI/C++ complaince, yuk!).
          This change save a few microseconds on the critical path,
          because QueryInterface() was used in remote method invocation,
          invoking many virtual methods, increasing the refcnt and then
          decreasing it again; but the real motivations are:
          + It was confusing to users it what way did TAO support COM (it
          does not, yet).
          + Removing QueryInterface() and the ref counting from the
          critical path will allow us to protect the ref counts with
          mutexes (strategized, of course).

        * taoconfig.mk:
          Removed -I$(TAO_ROOT)/tao/compat

        * Makefiles:
          Updated the dependencies in all the Makfiles of TAO (due to the
          removal of objbase.h & friends). Also fixed many problems in the
          Makefiles, like missing SRC or LSRC lists, removed the
          -I$(TAO_ROOT)/tao/compat includes, added missing TAO_ROOT
          definitions, etc.

Wed Jul 15 20:12:47 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.cpp: Changed the warnings that occur when
          a conf file is not found to be debug warnings (only show
          up with -ORBdebug)

Wed Jul 15 19:28:51 1998  Seth Widoff  <sbw1@cs.wuslt.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: Added trader files.

Wed Jul 15 18:00:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: Made sure, that all control paths
          resume the handler - checking invoke methods.

Wed Jul 15 16:27:01 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Simple: Added a new test that is just a simple test
          which can be used as a basis for new tests or just to see
          the basics of a CORBA client and server.

Wed Jul 15 16:00:39 1998  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cec.wustl.edu>

        * client.cpp: Changed a few cast statments; added comments

        * runtests.pl: New script to automate running of tests

Wed Jul 15 15:44:10 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

          invoke before waiting for a reply.

Wed Jul 15 12:40:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.{h,cpp}: Changed handle_input and send_request
          of the Client Connection Handler to support global
          resources and multiple threads. It is achieved through
          the leader follower model.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp: The suspended Client Connection Handler
          from Connect.cpp get resumed (TAO_GIOP_Invocation::invoke).

        * tao/ORB.{h,cpp}: The run method conforms to the rules
          of the leader follower model.

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp}: The ORB Core now supports all
          the variables for the leader follower model.

Wed Jul 15 12:07:15 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Servant_Base.cpp:
          Added timeprobes in operation lookup.

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/server.cpp:
          Added TIMEPROBE_PRINT at the end.

Wed Jul 15 12:11:01 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Property/Makefile:
          Removed unnecessary STL dependencies.

Wed Jul 15 11:44:57 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/CosPropertyService/Makefile: Removed STL stuff and
          did a make depend.

Wed Jul 15 10:55:33 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/run_tests.pl: removed hard-coded perl path.

Tue Jul 14 21:50:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/run_test.sh: use sh instead of ksh, $login
          instead of mk1, and $ps_opts.

        * orbsvcs/tests/start_services: bash doesn't always supply $USER,
          so use $login with it also.

Tue Jul 14 21:25:19 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makefile:

          These tests now copmile with egcs. In addition, Added modify and
          withdraw_using_constraint tests, and the "quiet" flag, which will
          staunch the usual barrage of output by not printing the contents
          of offers and service types.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.cpp: compiles with
          egcs.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/*.*: Compiles with egcs. Improved the
          modify method.

Tue Jul 14 19:15:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          The Event Channel modules are constructed using a Factory class,
          that will simplify configuration of the EC, like using RTU or
          FIFO dispatching, disabling correlation, or filtering, etc.

Tue Jul 14 18:35:56 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/gen_unbounded_sequence_ch.cpp:
          The generated replace() method released the buffer twice.

Tue Jul 14 15:56:46 1998  Nagarajan Surendran  <naga@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Machine_Properties.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Property_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
          Removed as they are moved to
          orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/mpeg/source/server.

        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/AVStreams/server.{h,cpp}:
          Removed as they are outdated.

Tue Jul 14 15:28:44 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_field/field_ch.cpp:
          Added support for arrays inside structures. Anonymous arrays do
          *not* work. Thanks to Eric Powers <powerg@deltanet.com> for this
          patch.

Tue Jul 14 14:40:36 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Event_Latency/Event_Latency.cpp (print_stats):
          when short-circuiting, don't print out time breakdowns to/in/from EC.

Tue Jul 14 13:30:01 1998  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Dispatching_Modules.cpp
          orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/RT_Task.h:

          Added conditional compilation logic to cause EC to use dynamic queues
          with appropriate dispatching strategies when the MUF, EDF, or MLF
          strategies are defined.  This is a temporary measure to allow
          testing of the EC performance with the dynamic queues, and will
          be relaced with a better configuration mechanism, based on the results
          of the off-line scheduling run, in the very near future.

Tue Jul 14 12:00:18 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_ss.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/interface_sh.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_interface/be_interface.cpp:
          Added server side support for CORBA::Object::_non_existent, in
          the future it could be implemented in the POA, saving an
          operation lookup and reducing the footprint somewhat.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSet.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSet.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSetFactory.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Concurrency/CC_LockSetFactory.cpp:
          Replaced ACE_Thread_Mutex with ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so it compiles in
          platforms without threads, not that it will work though.

Tue Jul 14 12:30:45 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/MT_Cubit/client.cpp (do_priority_inversion_test):
          removed dependence on local context_switch on platforms that don't
          have ACE_HAS_PRUSAGE_T and ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE.  Thanks to
          Arturo Montes" <mitosys@colomsat.net.co> for reporting this.  Also,
          removed csw on those platforms, because it was no longer being used.

Tue Jul 14 11:48:23 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{h,cpp} (arl_same_port_connect):  Added the new
          member function to ORB_Core to check if we want the client to
          initiate a connection using the same local port number as
          server's.

        * tao/Invocation.cpp (start): Added code to specify the following:

          This change is only for ARL only and to enable the feature, you
          must add

             #if defined (TAO_ARL_USES_SAME_CONNECTOR_PORT)

          to your $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h.  Add the command line option

             -ORBarlsameportconnect yes

          when starting the client.

          *** This is not for the general audience of TAO.  Don't use
          it. ***

Tue Jul 14 11:34:02 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp (do_static_call): commented out unused
          local "status".

Mon Jul 13 18:35:22 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/sequence_ch.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          Code generation for sequences of octets was incorrect in
          platforms that do not support automatic template
          instantiation. Thanks to Eric Powers <powerg@deltanet.com> for
          pointing this out.

Mon Jul 13 17:50:35 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.dsp:  Added Invocation.cpp into project.


        The following two changes were made per Carlos' instructions.
        (I was just typing.)

        * tao/deep_free.cpp (DEEP_FREE): Commented out 'delete source' in
          case of CORBA::tk_struct.

        * tao/Any.cpp (operator=, ~CORBA_Any, replace): Added delete
          this->value after DEEP_FREEing.

Mon Jul 13 17:37:01 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Object.cpp:
          Fixed some problems in the implementation of _non_existent(),
          thanks to Dave Meyer <dmeyer@std.saic.com>

Mon Jul 13 16:20:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/corba.h:

        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
        * tao/IIOP_Object.h:
        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp:
          On the client side we can optimize memory allocation for
          oneway requests by not allocating the response
          buffer. But to do this and take as much memory as possible from
          the stack also requires to follow different execution paths for
          the oneway vs. two way tests.
          With this changes the memory allocations are:
          + For oneways:
            1 on the client side (can be TSS allocator).
            3 on the server side (one can be TSS allocator).
          + For twoway:
            3 on the client side (1 can be a TSS allocator).
            3 on the server side (1 can be TSS allocator).


        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit.idl:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client_i.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/client_i.cpp:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.h:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/cubit_i.cpp:
          Added simple tests with no arguments or return values, also
          added a oneway test.

          The new files in the tao library changed the dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/Dump_Schedule/Makefile:
          Sources were listed in the wrong macro.

Mon Jul 13 14:37:06 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Event_Latency.cpp: use ACE_CU64_TO_CU32 to convert const
          64-bit u_ints to 32-bits happily with Sun C++.  Also, replaced
          a function-style cast and some other old casts with ACE
          ANSI-style casts.

Mon Jul 13 13:59:08 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/run_test.pl:
          Fixed a few (minor) perl warnings.

Mon Jul 13 11:49:29 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Marshall.i: Now setting freed string pointer to zero.

        * tao/deep_free.cpp: Although the struct fields were being freed,
          the memory for the struct itself wasn't. Note: other types may
          also have this problem.

Sun Jul 12 19:47:34 1998  Seth Widoff  <sbw1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/releasenotes/trader.html:
          Finished the initial draft of the Trading Service documentation.

Sun Jul 12 13:45:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/MT_Client_Test/*:
          Added a new test for testing multiple threads accessing
          global resources, which means, one ORB and one Reactor.
          It also tests for proper nested upcalls.

Sun Jul 12 01:40:58 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Fixed several problems reported by John Mulhern
          <9107@mn3.lawson.lawson.com>, that fix portability problems to
          HP/aCC.

        * tao/Typecode.cpp:
          Declared a temporary buffer as CORBA::Octet* instead of void*,
          otherwise HP/aCC balks.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_sequence.h:
        * TAO_IDL/be/be_sequence.cpp:
          fe_add_sequence() was redefined with different arguments and
          return value. It was not the intention and it triggered warnings
          on several compilers (HP/aCC, SGI/CC).

        * TAO_IDL/fe/y.tab.cpp:
          Removed indent pragma.
          Declared tao_yyerror as taking a const char*, it is not used
          anyway.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/tie_si.cpp:
          Tie delegation is similar to collocated upcalls, the arguments
          are T_ptr objects and not T_var, hence, no .in () calls are
          needed.

        * TAO_IDL/fe/fe_extern.cpp:
        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_preproc.cpp:
          Changed old C-style cast to reinterpret_cast, that should make
          HP/aCC compiler happy. This is just because SunCFE uses File* as
          a compilation barrier for FILE*, IMHO a waste of time.

Sat Jul 11 10:17:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile:
          Added EC_Mcast to the list of tests.

Fri Jul 10 22:25:44 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.38 released.

Fri Jul 10 22:06:16 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/CDR.i (do_byte_swap): added explicit int return type.

Fri Jul 10 17:51:13 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Param_Test/bd_str_seq.cpp:
        * Param_Test/ub_str_seq.cpp:
          DII tests now work.

        * Param_Test/bd_short_seq.cpp:
        * Param_Test/ub_short_seq.cpp:
        * Param_Test/bd_long_seq.cpp:
        * Param_Test/ub_long_seq.cpp:
          Minor changes in notation - no new functionality.

Fri Jul 10 17:29:25 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/svc.conf:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.h:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Mcast/EC_Mcast.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway_UDP.cpp:
          Added the first implementation of a UDP/Mcast based gateway to
          the EC. The current classes require a lot of manual
          configuration.
          Also implemented a small test to show the usage.

        * tao/CDR.h:
        * tao/CDR.i:
        * tao/CDR.cpp:
          Give access to external users of the swap_<n> methods, also
          provide an accesor for the byte swapping flag in OutputCDRs.

        * tao/GIOP.cpp:
          Use the new byte swap accessor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.i:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          Completed support for gateways that are interested in the
          supplier list changes. It is now possible to add Gateways
          *after* the consumer or supplier list has stabilized.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/EC_Gateway.cpp:
          Do nothing if receive a supplier update.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          Destroy the Event Channel *after* the consumers unsubscribe from
          it.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Multiple/EC_Multiple.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/Event_Service/Event_Service.cpp:
          Before a normal exit we unbind the Event Service (and, if local,
          the Scheduling Service) from the Naming Service.

Fri Jul 10 17:03:11 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.h:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:
          Addressed a number of memory leaks in the Trading
          Service. However, typecodes still leak oodles of memory.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.cpp:
          Cleans self up properly after catching SIGINT.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TT_Info.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/export_test.cpp:
          Aesthetic changes.

Fri Jul 10 16:35:21 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/client.cpp:
          Fixed bug in DII arg list creation.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/bd_short_seq.cpp:
        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/bd_long_seq.cpp:
        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/ub_short_seq.cpp:
        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/ub_long_seq.cpp:
          DII tests now work.

        * TAO/tests/Param_Test/any.cpp:
          Made some changes - not done yet. DII test still doesn't work.

Fri Jul 10 15:32:42 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Another pass.

Fri Jul 10 12:21:18 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          Fixed errors and warnings reported by David.

Fri Jul 10 00:32:51 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_argument/vardecl_ss.cpp:
          The skeletons were not releasing the strings allocated while
          demarshalling the arguments.

        * docs/implrepo.html:
          Another pass at the design document.

Thu Jul 09 23:02:48 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA.cpp (create_internal_lock): Change method to watch out
          for platforms without threads.  Thanks to Hongyin Quan
          <hq1@arl.wustl.edu> for pointing this out.

Thu Jul  9 17:48:37 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Carlos's comments have been addressed.

Thu Jul  9 15:12:35 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/deep_free.cpp: wasn't freeing string fields of structs.

        * tests/Quoter/Makefile: removed STL vestige.

Wed Jul  8 21:08:53 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html:
          Quick revision and added comments with remaining issues.

Wed Jul  8 19:01:02 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/implrepo.html: Another big revision of the paper.

Wed Jul  8 17:13:00 1998  Jeff Parsons  <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.h,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsw,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.cpp,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.dsp,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/README,
          TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile:
          Combined client.h and client.cpp into one file,
          initialized the return variables in all the Cubit
          operations (to get rid of some UMRs in Purify),
          removed the one-button test file DII_Cubit_Test.cpp
          and the corresponding project file in VC (the perl
          script does the same thing and more safely), updated
          the DII_Cubit.dsw, Makefile and README files.

Tue Jul  8 14:00:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/orbsvcs.dsp: When changing the RtecEventComm.id
          file or the RtecScheduler.idl file, it is needed to
          recompile the RtecEventChannelAdmin.idl file. This is a common
          problem. So the programmer has to take care that the
          dependencies in the Makefile or VC++ project file
          are set properly.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.cpp,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java.JDK1.2,
          orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README:
          Simplified the event data.

Tue Jul  7 22:11:17 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
          Fixed DEC cxx errors, addressed a memory leak.

Tue Jul  7 20:48:37 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.{h,cpp}:  Revert my previous changes.

Tue Jul  7 19:47:15 198   Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tao/Request.cpp: Slight modification (Andy's
          suggestion) to send_oneway (), getting rid of an
          error message when shutting down the Cubit server
          via DII.

Tue Jul  7 19:25:55 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.cpp:
          New file that implements a "one-button" DII Cubit test.
        * DII_Cubit/Makefile: Added a build for dii_cubit_test.exe.
        * DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.dsp: New project in the workspace.
        * DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsw: Updated workspace (new project).

Tue Jul  7 08:21:41 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

Tue Jul 07 07:36:36 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: use #if 0 instead of // to comment out a
          multiline #define, to avoid warning about a multiline comment.

        * tests/Param_Test/results.{h,cpp}: added trailing $ to Id string.

Mon Jul  6 19:33:54 1998  Jeff Parsons  <jp4@cs.wustl,edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
          Made the shutdown request DII instead of SII. Everything
          works on NT except for the shutdown option. Unix is OK.
          Also, changed the parse_args call to come after initializing
          the orb, so other orb-specific args can be used and not
          confuse parse_args.

Mon Jul  6 19:17:00 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

Mon Jul  6 17:00:00 1998  Jeff Parsons   <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.{h,cpp}:
          Added a DII request on the naming service to get the
          Cubit factory IOR, plus code to implement all the
          command line options. Built with SunCC, it works on Unix,
          but not yet on NT.

Mon Jul  6 15:46:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Strings contain a nested CDR with the bounds for it, the
          demarshalling code in that case was invoking the TypeCode
          constructor with the wrong parameters, hence the bounds were
          invalid.  The problem only shows up now because we were ignoring
          the bounds in previous releases.

Mon Jul  6 15:24:21 1998  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cec.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logger/client.h
        * tests/Logger/client.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.h
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Log/Logger_i.cpp
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Logger.idl

          Routine checkin. Ignore the man behind that curtain....
          Fully working version complete, but not yet Purified.

Mon Jul 06 15:13:11 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/initguid.h: Reordered some stuff.

        * tao/corba.h: Don't include in "compat/initguid.h" anymore.

Mon Jul  6 15:10:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Data.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          The CDR size was wrong, this resulted in all kind of strange
          errors n the client side. This is another reminder that an octet
          sequence only uses a single Message_Block, not a chain of them.

Mon Jul 06 14:58:14 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Object.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/Server_Request.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Renamed REFIID to TAO_REFIID and
          DEFINE_GUID to TAO_DEFINE_GUID to avoid conflict with MSVC's
          COM.  We don't support COM at this moment.

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Disable the definition of TAO_VARENUM.  It
          is not used currently.  Thanks to Maximilian Hoferer
          <mhoferer@krones.de> for noticing this.

Mon Jul 06 09:07:36 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{i cpp}: Removed redundant preprocessing token
          concatentations - HP-UX aCC warned about them.

        * tao/Connect.h: Added #include "tao/corba.h" so the defs are visible
          at template instantiation on AIX xlC.

Mon Jul  6 04:45:02 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.h (TAO_Client_Connect_Handler): Added a new data
          member <reactive_> to trace whether this client connection is
          running reactively or in a separate thread (other than the main
          thread.)

        * tao/Connect.cpp (open,close,send_request): Check to see if the
          client is going to run in a separate thread (by comparing its
          thread id with that of reactor's.)  If so, the handler won't try
          to register itself with the reactor and simply block on the
          socket IO calls.  This change enables the NestedUpcall/Reactor
          example to use the thread-per-connection strategy.

Sun Jul  5 21:22:42 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Undid the change I made on July 3.  Although it
          fixed the one problem I was looking at, it broke everything
          else.  Oops.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: Changed the TAO_EXPORT_MACRO
          definition to override any that came before.  Without this the
          ordering of includes (putting corba.h before an orbsvc, such as
          CosNamingC.h) would break in certain configurations.  Also moved
          it after the includes so it shouldn't affect included files.

Sat Jul  4 01:18:21 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Constraint_Interpreter.cpp:

          Addressed warnings/errors on IRIX.

Fri Jul 03 21:51:44 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp (parse_args):
          reset n_suppliers_ to 1, if <= 0, before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN
          instead of after.  (supplier_task): cast event_count_ to
          CORBA::ULong to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp (push_consumer):
          commented out unused local "ID".

Fri Jul  3 19:54:03 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Changed the TAO_NAMESPACE_STORAGE_CLASS macros to
          work better with namespaces on MSVC.

Fri Jul  3 18:40:46 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:
          Debugged and tested directed queries.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Importer.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/import_test.cpp:
          Added code to test directed queries.

Fri Jul 03 17:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/README: Added more documentation.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java: Register
          now only for notification events.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/AnyAnalyser.{h,cpp}: support time stamps.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/DOVEMIB.{h,cpp}: support time stamps.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/PrintVisitor.{h,cpp}: support time stamps

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.{h, cpp}: moved
          a lot of connection management into the new DOVE Supplier.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.dsp: Added the DOVE
          Suplier files.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{h,cpp}: All
          the connection management with the event service is done here.
          A standardized interface is now supported, thanks to
          Kevin Stanley <kstanley1@mdc.com>.

Fri Jul 03 16:38:12 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/Sequence.h (TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<CORBA::Octet>) Removed the
          template type specification from constructor names so that this
          compiles on AIX xlC as well as Sun C++ and HPUX aCC.

Fri Jul 03 13:58:08 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.37 released.

Fri Jul  3 13:05:01 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Data.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
          Fixed template instantiations.

Fri Jul 03 11:36:04 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile,
          tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: disabled perfect
          hashing until we can stabilize its use.

Fri Jul 03 11:34:38 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:
          Added new object files to the Makefile.

Wed Jul  1 15:50:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Fixed a memory leak in the initial
          references code. The pointers (name_service_ and trading_service_)
          were not properly reused and not properly released.

        * tao/Operation_Table.h: Fixed a spelling problem with
          TAO_operation_db_entry.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Makefile:
          Made Trading Service app resemble other orbsvcs apps. Accepts -TS*

          federation with other traders on the same multicast network.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Importer.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/export_test.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makfile:
          export_test will now export service types and offers to all
          traders linked to the multicast-enabled trader, so import_test
          will test federated queries.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.{h,cpp}: Added an init method for
          initialization outside the constructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Changed macro name from
          TAO_HAS_DYNAMIC_PROPERTY_BUG to TAO_HAS_OBJECT_IN_STRUCT_MARSHAL_BUG.

             and multithreading support.
          o  Debugged link interface and federated queries.
          o  Added explicit template specialization.

Wed Jul  1 1:55:23 1998 Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile: It works, at least with
          SunCC. It builds the DII client and also the IDL server if
          necessary (since we run it before running client.exe) -thanks
          to David Levine for that.
        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.h, cpp: Now builds and
          executes on Unix and NT. Also added some macros for the
          environment checking inside the operations.

Wed Jul  1 10:28:07 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

Wed Jul  1 06:36:11 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/any_op_cs.cpp: For the copying
          version of the <<= operator, we were not doing a copy. Thanks to
          Seth Widoff for pointing this out.

Tue Jun 30 22:08:38 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

Tue Jun 30 16:50:12 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        First round of changes for GPERF + TAO_IDL integration. Execute
        tao_idl with -P option to enable PERFECT_HASH operation lookup
        strategy.

        IDL-Attributes are not supported yet.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp: Added option -P to enable
          PERFECT_HASH operation lookup strategy.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h: Added methods to generate
          perfect hashing operation lookup table in the server skeleton
          code.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h (class TAO_OutStream): Added a
          new stream type GPERF_INPUT to indicate the outstream is for
          gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h (class TAO_CodeGen):  Added <enum
          LOOKUP_STRATEGY {...}> to indicate various lookup
          strategies. Added the member and access methods that keeps track
          of the TAO_OutStream that corresponds to the gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Included "ace/Process.h".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

        * tao/Operation_Table.h (TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable):
        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp :
          Defined the class TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable, the factory
          class for Perfect_Hashing-Operation_Lookup strategy.

Tue Jun 30 13:23:59 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          Workaround Sun/CC problem when compiling with -O (but not
          -fast). Apparently it does not like to use static (file) scope
          symbols in the definition of a template.

Tue Jun 30 10:40:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/configurations.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

        * tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.{h,cpp}: Added the create_iiop_profile_lock (void)

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Use ACE_Lock instead of ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.h: Changed the forward profile lock to a pointer to a lock.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.i: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}: Added the parsing of "-ORBportiiopproflielock" to
          the parse_args method. "thread" (default) means to use a mutex lock
          on the access of the forwarding iiop profile. "null" means, use a null
          mutex, which is faster, but does not provide any protection.
          Added also the function create_iiop_profile_lock () to allow
          others to create a new lock, depending on the above mentioned switch.

Tue Jun 30 00:58:57 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.36 released.

Mon Jun 29 14:43:17 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp (gen_forany_defn): changed
          declaration of friend CORBA::Any to friend class CORBA_Any,
          to keep DEC cxx from complaining.  Also, commented out
          the declaration, because it doesn't appear to be necessary.

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): cast sizeof to int
          to avoid egcs warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Jun 29 11:05:03 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Removed unused variable.

Mon Jun 29 11:00:26 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

          After the call to do_static_call, we were not checking if some
          exception was raised. This was causing major problems if there was
          any post do_static_call processing such as narrowing to be
          done. Thanks to Seth Widoff for reporting the problem.

Sun Jun 28 21:33:48 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: replaced ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX with
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that it will compile with g++
          (and be correct :-).

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): changed loop index
          i from u_int to int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Sun Jun 28 16:10:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/Triangle_Test/Makefile: Added
          this Makefile for use on Unix machines.

Sun Jun 28 15:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: In method location_forwarding, removed
          the explicit release of the IIOP_Object. It is implicitly
          released by the release of the CORBA::OBject pointer.

        * tests/Quoter/Generic_Factory_Impl.{h,cpp}: Splitted
          the create_object method into two parts.

Sat Jun 27 18:13:05 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): Changed
          #include "ace/Timeprobes.h" to #include "tao/Timeprobes.h".
