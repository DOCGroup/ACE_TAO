Tue Jul  7 19:47:15 198   Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>
	* TAO/tao/Request.cpp: Slight modification (Andy's
	  suggestion) to send_oneway (), getting rid of an
	  error message when shutting down the Cubit server
	  via DII.

Tue Jul  7 19:25:55 1998  Jeff Parsons <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.cpp: 
	  New file that implements a "one-button" DII Cubit test.
	* DII_Cubit/Makefile: Added a build for dii_cubit_test.exe.
	* DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit_Test.dsp: New project in the workspace.
	* DII_Cubit/DII_Cubit.dsw: Updated workspace (new project).

Tue Jul 07 07:36:36 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: use #if 0 instead of // to comment out a
          multiline #define, to avoid warning about a multiline comment.

        * tests/Param_Test/results.{h,cpp}: added trailing $ to Id string.

Mon Jul  6 19:33:54 1998  Jeff Parsons  <jp4@cs.wustl,edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.cpp:
          Made the shutdown request DII instead of SII. Everything
          works on NT except for the shutdown option. Unix is OK.
          Also, changed the parse_args call to come after initializing
          the orb, so other orb-specific args can be used and not
          confuse parse_args.

Mon Jul  6 19:17:00 1998  Michael Kircher <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/Options.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

Mon Jul  6 17:00:00 1998  Jeff Parsons   <jp4@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.{h,cpp}:
          Added a DII request on the naming service to get the
          Cubit factory IOR, plus code to implement all the
          command line options. Built with SunCC, it works on Unix,
          but not yet on NT.

Mon Jul  6 15:46:35 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/decode.cpp:
          Strings contain a nested CDR with the bounds for it, the
          demarshalling code in that case was invoking the TypeCode
          constructor with the wrong parameters, hence the bounds were
          invalid.  The problem only shows up now because we were ignoring
          the bounds in previous releases.

Mon Jul  6 15:24:21 1998  Matthew J Braun  <mjb2@cec.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Logger/client.h

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Logger.idl

        Routine checkin. Ignore the man behind that curtain....
        Fully working version complete, but not yet Purified.

Mon Jul 06 15:13:11 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/compat/initguid.h: Reordered some stuff.

        * tao/corba.h: Don't include in "compat/initguid.h" anymore.

Mon Jul  6 15:10:30 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Makefile:
          Updated dependencies.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Data.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp:
          The CDR size was wrong, this resulted in all kind of strange
          errors n the client side. This is another reminder that an octet
          sequence only uses a single Message_Block, not a chain of them.

Mon Jul 06 14:58:14 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/IIOP_Object.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/Object.{h,i,cpp}:
        * tao/Server_Request.{h,cpp}:
        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Renamed REFIID to TAO_REFIID and
          DEFINE_GUID to TAO_DEFINE_GUID to avoid conflict with MSVC's
          COM.  We don't support COM at this moment.

        * tao/compat/objbase.h: Disable the definition of TAO_VARENUM.  It
          is not used currently.  Thanks to Maximilian Hoferer
          <mhoferer@krones.de> for noticing this.

Mon Jul 06 09:07:36 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/ORB_Core.{i cpp}: Removed redundant preprocessing token
          concatentations - HP-UX aCC warned about them.

        * tao/Connect.h: Added #include "tao/corba.h" so the defs are visible
          at template instantiation on AIX xlC.

Mon Jul  6 04:45:02 1998  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Connect.h (TAO_Client_Connect_Handler): Added a new data
          member <reactive_> to trace whether this client connection is
          running reactively or in a separate thread (other than the main
          thread.)

        * tao/Connect.cpp (open,close,send_request): Check to see if the
          client is going to run in a separate thread (by comparing its
          thread id with that of reactor's.)  If so, the handler won't try
          to register itself with the reactor and simply block on the
          socket IO calls.  This change enables the NestedUpcall/Reactor
          example to use the thread-per-connection strategy.

Sun Jul  5 21:22:42 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Undid the change I made on July 3.  Although it
          fixed the one problem I was looking at, it broke everything
          else.  Oops.

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp: Changed the TAO_EXPORT_MACRO
          definition to override any that came before.  Without this the
          ordering of includes (putting corba.h before an orbsvc, such as
          CosNamingC.h) would break in certain configurations.  Also moved
          it after the includes so it shouldn't affect included files.

Sat Jul  4 01:18:21 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

Fri Jul 03 21:51:44 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Supplier.cpp (parse_args):
          reset n_suppliers_ to 1, if <= 0, before the ACE_ERROR_RETURN
          instead of after.  (supplier_task): cast event_count_ to
          CORBA::ULong to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/ECT_Consumer.cpp (push_consumer):
          commented out unused local "ID".

Fri Jul  3 19:54:03 1998  Darrell Brunsch <brunsch@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/orbconf.h: Changed the TAO_NAMESPACE_STORAGE_CLASS macros to
          work better with namespaces on MSVC.

Fri Jul  3 18:40:46 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Utils.{h,cpp}:

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/PushConsumer.java: Register
          now only for notification events.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/AnyAnalyser.{h,cpp}: support time stamps.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/DOVEMIB.{h,cpp}: support time stamps.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEMIB/PrintVisitor.{h,cpp}: support time stamps

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.{h, cpp}: moved
          a lot of connection management into the new DOVE Supplier.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/Event_Sup.dsp: Added the DOVE
          Suplier files.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/Event_Supplier/DOVE_Supplier.{h,cpp}: All
          the connection management with the event service is done here.
          A standardized interface is now supported, thanks to
          Kevin Stanley <kstanley1@mdc.com>.

Fri Jul 03 16:38:12 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/Sequence.h (TAO_Unbounded_Sequence<CORBA::Octet>) Removed the
          template type specification from constructor names so that this
          compiles on AIX xlC as well as Sun C++ and HPUX aCC.

Fri Jul 03 13:58:08 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.37 released.

          hashing until we can stabilize its use.

Fri Jul 03 11:34:38 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@JIG>

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/Makefile:

          Protected against null publication or subscription list.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Event/Event_Channel.cpp:
          Removed a possible race condition in consumer
          disconnections. Thanks to Thomas Venturella <tventurell@mdc.com>
          for the last two fixes.

Fri Jul 03 08:40:28 1998  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tao/corba.h: Reordered some includes to get it to compile clean on
          HP-UX aCC.

        * tests/Param_Test/Makefile:
        * tests/Cubit/TAO/IDL_Cubit/Makefile: Added TAO_IDLFLAGS -P to enable
          Perfect-hashed-operation-lookup strategy for the idl compiler.

Thu Jul  2 19:22:24 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/tests/Makefile:

          Added some padding so the payload (an encapsulated CDR) is
          always properly aligned.

        * orbsvcs/tests/EC_Throughput/README:
        * docs/releasenotes/ec.html:
          Included some info about this new test.

Thu Jul  2 14:28:01 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp: We were generating incorrect code for
        the out () and _retn () methods of the Array_var class.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Missing #include for Process.h added.

        * TAO_IDL/Makefile: Ran make depend

          Constraint Interpreter needs to identify and extract from Anys
          sequences of primitive types, regardless of how many times the
          sequence has been typedef'd. Added code to do this.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/TTest.idl:

        * tests/CDR/growth.cpp (main),
          tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (run): replaced
          ACE_hrtime_t-to-ACE_INT32 static casts with ACE_U64_TO_U32
          for compatibility with ACE_U_LongLong.

        * tests/NestedUpcall/Triangle_Test/Object_A_Impl.cpp: added
          newline at end of file.

        * tests/POA/On_Demand_Activation/Servant_Locator.cpp (postinvoke):
          added ACE_UNUSED_ARG (my_servant) to avoid compile warning about

          ACE_OS::fprintf instead of fprintf, and fixed the format
          specifier to match the argument type.

        * Makefile (release): use $(MAKE) instead of make for
          recursive make.

Thu Jul 02 01:50:58 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/POA: Renamed TAO_POA_Locking to Synchronization.  Also
          renamed the related enums to not use the USE_ prefix.

Wed Jul  1 22:42:13 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosTrading.idl:
          Merged Sequences.idl into CosTrading.idl.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_T.{h,cpp}:

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/Trader_Interfaces.{h,cpp}:
          Addressed DEC cxx warnings/errors. Hopefully solved some, probbaly
          introduced more.

Wed Jul 01 21:14:11 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Param_Test/any.cpp: commented out unused static
          any_table.

        * tests/Param_Test/fixed_array.cpp (check_validity): commented
          out unused local ret.

        * tests/Param_Test/{bd,ub}_str_seq.cpp (init_parameters):
          commented out unused local gen.

Wed Jul  1 19:20:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

          fixed the complains of the DEC cxx compiler.

Wed Jul  1 15:50:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/ORB.cpp: Fixed a memory leak in the initial
          references code. The pointers (name_service_ and trading_service_)
          were not properly reused and not properly released.

        * tao/Operation_Table.h: Fixed a spelling problem with
          TAO_operation_db_entry.

Wed Jul  1 13:59:30 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/TAO.{h,cpp}: Passing in argc to the TAO_ORB_Manager by
          reference, since ORB_init takes argc by reference.

        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Trading_Service.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/Trading_Service/Makefile:
          Made Trading Service app resemble other orbsvcs apps. Accepts -TS*
          command line arguments. Has the ability to form a complete graph
          federation with other traders on the same multicast network.

        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Offer_Importer.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Service_Type_Exporter.{h,cpp}:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/export_test.cpp:
        * orbsvcs/tests/Trading/Makfile:
          export_test will now export service types and offers to all
          traders linked to the multicast-enabled trader, so import_test
          will test federated queries.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/IOR_Multicast.{h,cpp}: Added an init method for
          initialization outside the constructor.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Makefile: Changed macro name from
          TAO_HAS_DYNAMIC_PROPERTY_BUG to TAO_HAS_OBJECT_IN_STRUCT_MARSHAL_BUG.

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Trader/*.*:
          o  Hopefully fixed DEC cxx errors/warnings.
          o  Added command-line configuration of trader policies, interfaces,
             and multithreading support.
          o  Debugged link interface and federated queries.
          o  Added explicit template specialization.

        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/Makefile: It works, at least with
          SunCC. It builds the DII client and also the IDL server if
          necessary (since we run it before running client.exe) -thanks
          to David Levine for that.
        * TAO/tests/Cubit/TAO/DII_Cubit/client.h, cpp: Now builds and
          executes on Unix and NT. Also added some macros for the
          environment checking inside the operations.

Wed Jul  1 10:28:07 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h (be_type): Fixed the warnings
          in g++.

Wed Jul  1 06:36:11 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/any_op_cs.cpp: For the copying
          version of the <<= operator, we were not doing a copy. Thanks to
          Seth Widoff for pointing this out.

Tue Jun 30 22:08:38 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (lookup_strategy): added full
          qualification of TAO_CodeGen::LOOKUP_STRATEGY return type.

Tue Jun 30 18:27:49 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.i:
          Another ACE_CAST_CONST problem, thanks to Seth Widoff
          (sbw1@cs.wustl.edu) for catching this one.

Tue Jun 30 18:21:04 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/Makefile:
          Removed STL includes --- no longer needed for Trading Service.

Tue Jun 30 16:50:12 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        First round of changes for GPERF + TAO_IDL integration. Execute
        tao_idl with -P option to enable PERFECT_HASH operation lookup
        strategy.

        IDL-Attributes are not supported yet.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp: Added option -P to enable
          PERFECT_HASH operation lookup strategy.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h: Added methods to generate
          perfect hashing operation lookup table in the server skeleton
          code.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h (class TAO_OutStream): Added a
          new stream type GPERF_INPUT to indicate the outstream is for
          gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h (class TAO_CodeGen):  Added <enum
          LOOKUP_STRATEGY {...}> to indicate various lookup
          strategies. Added the member and access methods that keeps track
          of the TAO_OutStream that corresponds to the gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Included "ace/Process.h".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

        * tao/Operation_Table.h (TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable):
        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp :
          Defined the class TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable, the factory
          class for Perfect_Hashing-Operation_Lookup strategy.

Tue Jun 30 13:23:59 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          Workaround Sun/CC problem when compiling with -O (but not
          -fast). Apparently it does not like to use static (file) scope
          symbols in the definition of a template.

Tue Jun 30 10:40:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/configurations.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

        * tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.{h,cpp}: Added the create_iiop_profile_lock (void)

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Use ACE_Lock instead of ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.h: Changed the forward profile lock to a pointer to a lock.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.i: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}: Added the parsing of "-ORBportiiopproflielock" to
          the parse_args method. "thread" (default) means to use a mutex lock
          on the access of the forwarding iiop profile. "null" means, use a null
          mutex, which is faster, but does not provide any protection.
          Added also the function create_iiop_profile_lock () to allow
          others to create a new lock, depending on the above mentioned switch.

Tue Jun 30 00:58:57 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.36 released.

Mon Jun 29 14:43:17 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp (gen_forany_defn): changed
          declaration of friend CORBA::Any to friend class CORBA_Any,
          to keep DEC cxx from complaining.  Also, commented out
          the declaration, because it doesn't appear to be necessary.

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): cast sizeof to int
          to avoid egcs warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Jun 29 11:05:03 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Removed unused variable.

Mon Jun 29 11:00:26 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

          After the call to do_static_call, we were not checking if some
          exception was raised. This was causing major problems if there was
          any post do_static_call processing such as narrowing to be
          done. Thanks to Seth Widoff for reporting the problem.

Sun Jun 28 21:33:48 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: replaced ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX with
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that it will compile with g++
          (and be correct :-).

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): changed loop index
          i from u_int to int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Sun Jun 28 16:10:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/Triangle_Test/Makefile: Added
          this Makefile for use on Unix machines.

Sun Jun 28 15:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: In method location_forwarding, removed
          the explicit release of the IIOP_Object. It is implicitly
          released by the release of the CORBA::OBject pointer.

        * tests/Quoter/Generic_Factory_Impl.{h,cpp}: Splitted
          the create_object method into two parts.

Sat Jun 27 18:13:05 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): Changed
          #include "ace/Timeprobes.h" to #include "tao/Timeprobes.h".
