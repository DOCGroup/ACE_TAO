	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_sequence/any_op_cs.cpp: For the copying
	version of the <<= operator, we were not doing a copy. Thanks to
	Seth Widoff for pointing this out.

Tue Jun 30 22:08:38 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp (lookup_strategy): added full
          qualification of TAO_CodeGen::LOOKUP_STRATEGY return type.

Tue Jun 30 18:27:49 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/Sequence_T.i:
          Another ACE_CAST_CONST problem, thanks to Seth Widoff
          (sbw1@cs.wustl.edu) for catching this one.

Tue Jun 30 18:21:04 1998  Seth Benjamin Widoff  <sbw1@waltz.cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Quoter/Makefile:
        Remove STL includes --- no longer needed for Trading Service.

Tue Jun 30 16:50:12 1998  Alexander Babu Arulanthu  <alex@cs.wustl.edu>

        First round of changes for GPERF + TAO_IDL integration. Execute
        tao_idl with -P option to enable PERFECT_HASH operation lookup
        strategy.

        IDL-Attributes are not supported yet.

        * TAO_IDL/driver/drv_args.cpp: Added option -P to enable
        PERFECT_HASH operation lookup strategy.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_interface.h: Added methods to generate
        perfect hashing operation lookup table in the server skeleton
        code.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_helper.h (class TAO_OutStream): Added a
        new stream type GPERF_INPUT to indicate the outstream is for
        gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be_codegen.h (class TAO_CodeGen):  Added <enum
        LOOKUP_STRATEGY {...}> to indicate various lookup
        strategies. Added the member and access methods that keeps track
        of the TAO_OutStream that corresponds to the gperf's input file.

        * TAO_IDL/be_include/be.h: Included "ace/Process.h".

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_interface.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_helper.cpp:

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_codegen.cpp:

        * tao/Operation_Table.h (TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable):
        * tao/Operation_Table.cpp :
                Defined the class TAO_Perfect_Hash_OpTable, the factory
        class for Perfect_Hashing-Operation_Lookup strategy.

Tue Jun 30 13:23:59 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * orbsvcs/orbsvcs/Scheduler_Factory.cpp:
          Workaround Sun/CC problem when compiling with -O (but not
          -fast). Apparently it does not like to use static (file) scope
          symbols in the definition of a template.

Tue Jun 30 10:40:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * docs/configurations.html: Added documentation about the
          -ORBiiopprofilelock switch.

        * tao/Client_Strategy_Factory.{h,cpp}: Added the create_iiop_profile_lock (void)

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: Use ACE_Lock instead of ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.cpp: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.h: Changed the forward profile lock to a pointer to a lock.

        * tao/IIOP_Object.i: Added the initialization of the fwd_profile_lock_ptr to
          the constructor.

        * tao/default_client.{h,cpp}: Added the parsing of "-ORBportiiopproflielock" to
          the parse_args method. "thread" (default) means to use a mutex lock
          on the access of the forwarding iiop profile. "null" means, use a null
          mutex, which is faster, but does not provide any protection.
          Added also the function create_iiop_profile_lock () to allow
          others to create a new lock, depending on the above mentioned switch.

Tue Jun 30 00:58:57 1998  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO version 0.1.36 released.

Mon Jun 29 14:43:17 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_array.cpp (gen_forany_defn): changed
          declaration of friend CORBA::Any to friend class CORBA_Any,
          to keep DEC cxx from complaining.  Also, commented out
          the declaration, because it doesn't appear to be necessary.

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): cast sizeof to int
          to avoid egcs warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Jun 29 11:05:03 1998  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/encode.cpp:
          Removed unused variable.

Mon Jun 29 11:00:26 1998  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

        After the call to do_static_call, we were not checking if some
        exception was raised. This was causing major problems if there was
        any post do_static_call processing such as narrowing to be
        done. Thanks to Seth Widoff for reporting the problem.

Sun Jun 28 21:33:48 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: replaced ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX with
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that it will compile with g++
          (and be correct :-).

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): changed loop index
          i from u_int to int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Sun Jun 28 16:10:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/Triangle_Test/Makefile: Added
          this Makefile for use on Unix machines.

Sun Jun 28 15:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: In method location_forwarding, removed
          the explicit release of the IIOP_Object. It is implicitly
          released by the release of the CORBA::OBject pointer.

        * tests/Quoter/Generic_Factory_Impl.{h,cpp}: Splitted
          the create_object method into two parts.

Sat Jun 27 18:13:05 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): Changed
          #include "ace/Timeprobes.h" to #include "tao/Timeprobes.h".
