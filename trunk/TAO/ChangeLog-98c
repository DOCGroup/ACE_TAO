Tue May 20 14:32:00 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

	* IIOP/test/*: Commited changes to Cubit Example as a current snapshot
          of required changes.

Tue May 20 13:55:58 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/test/*: Commited this stuff in-process so that Brian
 	M. doesn't have to duplicate effort.

Tue May 20 13:04:00 1997  Brian Mendel <bmendel@mdc.com>

	* IIOP/lib/debug.cpp: Deleted spaces between flockfile (f) and 
	funlockfile (f).  Changed instances of debug_filter to 
	TAO_debug_filter.  Deleted space between emit_prefix (stream).

	* IIOP/lib/cdr.cpp Added undef(s) for ACE_INLINE and 
          do_undef_on_ACE_INLINE to eliminate redefinition problems.


Tue May 20 10:55:09 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/cdr.h: Fixed the automatic inclusion of cdr.i into
 	cdr.h by checking to see if __ACE_INLINE__ is not defined and, if
 	so, defining ACE_INLINE to be "inline" (we tidy up the namespace
 	immediately after the inclusion of cdr.i, too).  See source for
 	comments regarding why this is done.

	* IIOP/lib/optable.cpp (TAO_Linear_OpTable_Entry): Removed setting
 	of opname and skel_ptr to zero in CTOR since the CTOR for those
 	already insures this.  Moreover, NT's compiler was complaining
 	about ambiguous resolutions.

	* IIOP/lib/{orbobj,giop,debug,boa}.cpp: Fixed reference to
 	debug_level so it's TAO_debug_level.

	* IIOP/lib/object.h: Replaced inclusion of optable.h with forward
 	decl of TAO_Operation_Table.

	* IIOP/lib/optable.cpp: Fixed names of methods that were changed
 	in the header but never changed in the source.  Amazing that
 	neither g++ nor Sun C++ caught these gaffs!  (Finally, the NT
 	compiler wins).

	* IIOP/lib/{orbobj,object}.h: Changed the forward decls of
 	CORBA_release() and CORBA_is_nil() so that they are only in effect
 	when inlining is NOT being used.

	* IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Fixed incorrect passing of an object to
 	ACE_DEBUG() where an int is expected.

Mon May 19 17:16:34 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@merengue.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Explicit cast rids us of a warning.

	* IIOP/lib/params.h: Fixed CTOR name.  Once again I'm surprised
 	G++ didn't catch this.

	* IIOP/lib/optable.h: Corrected erroneous method signature on
 	bind().

	* IIOP/lib/objtable.cpp: Corrected erroneous method signature on
 	TAO_Linear_ObjTable::bind().

	* IIOP/lib/{object,orbobj}.h: Forward declaration of
 	CORBA_release(CORBA_Object_ptr) and CORBA_is_nil(CORBA_Object_ptr)
 	were commented out.  I think this will cause a problem when we
 	DON'T inline, but I'll cross that bridge later.

	* IIOP/lib/{orb,factories}.h: Made inclusion of some headers
 	conditional on the compilation phase (building the library or an
 	application).

	* IIOP/lib/cdr.i: Removed incorrect default arguments (g++ didn't
 	catch them).

	* IIOP/lib/Makefile: Removed thread from the header list.

Mon May 19 10:07:00 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/optable.cpp: Changed implementation of the operation
 	table and the parameters repository so that they use the right
 	class names.

Fri May 16 17:30:31 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/svrrqst.*: Corrected some comments, adjusted some
 	argument type names to reflect their new, namespace-sanitized
 	names, and moved short methods into a new inline file.

	* IIOP/lib/stub.h: Corrected some comments and adjusted some
 	argument type names to reflect their new, namespace-sanitized
 	names.

	* IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Corrected syntax error and fixed up typedef.

	* IIOP/lib/params.*: Removed extraneous comments and fixed
 	argument type on demux_strategy().

	* IIOP/lib/orbobj.*: Added comments, removed static pointer to
 	the ORB.

	* IIOP/lib/optable.h: Removed extraneous comments and fixed
 	typedefs.

	* IIOP/lib/objtable.cpp: Fixed some syntax errors introduced by
 	reformating.

	* IIOP/lib/object.cpp: Adjusted some argument type names to
 	reflect their new, namespace-sanitized names.

	* IIOP/lib/invoke.cpp: Removed crufty #includes and adjusted some
 	argument type names to reflect their new, namespace-sanitized
 	names.

	* IIOP/lib/iioporb.*: Moved short methods into inline file, added
 	IIOP_ORB_ptr typedef, and changed data member to conform to ace
 	standards.

	* IIOP/lib/iiopobj.*: Added the second CTOR that I forgot last
 	time and adjusted some argument type names to reflect their new,
 	namespace-sanitized names.

	* IIOP/lib/giop.h: Added comments for various enums and
 	structures.

	* IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Switched various GIOP::Invocation methods to
 	use handler_->peer() for socket communication rather than going
 	through a file descriptor.  Also began the arduous (no other word
 	could explain it!) process of converting the homegrown debugging
 	message macro uses into ACE_DEBUG() uses.

	* IIOP/lib/factories.*: Added explicit DTOR for TAO_Client_Factory
 	and completed all the darn explicit template instantiations.
  	Changed 'Svc_Handler' to 'TAO_Client_Connection_Handler', and
 	added the forgotton TAO_Client_Factory::connector() method.

	* IIOP/lib/debug.*: Added 'TAO_' prefix to global debug state
 	variables and removed crufty #includes.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.cpp: Change ROA_Handler to
 	TOA_OA_Connection_Handler (missed these the last time through).

	* IIOP/lib/cdr.cpp: Added responsive commentary.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Added comments to the dispatching code.

	* IIOP/lib/{any,boa,request,typecode}.cpp: Removed references to
 	thread.h/connmgr.*.

Thu May 15 19:08:16 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Finished updating all the reformatting.

Thu May 15 15:54:49 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/principa.h: Corrected syntax error which eliminated the
 	_refcount data member.

	* IIOP/lib/{params,roa}.*: Updated class names to reflect ROA -->
 	TOA_OA pseudo-namespace change.

	* IIOP/lib/orbobj.*: Updated CORBA_ORB_init() to return pointer to
 	new ORB singleton.

	* IIOP/lib/orb.h: Commented out some include files to eliminate
 	wierd circular dependencies.

	* IIOP/lib/optable.h: Moved TAP_Operation_Table into here.  Put
 	OpTable* classes into the TAO_Operation_Table* pseudo-namespace.

	* IIOP/lib/objtable.*: Moved TAO_Object_Table into here.  Moved
 	the Entry classes out of the scope of their respective concrete
 	operation tables, so they're now named <concrete_table>_Entry.

	* IIOP/lib/object.*: Moved TAO_Operation_Table into optable.*, and
 	added a data member which carries a pointer to the ORB with which
 	the object is associated.

	* IIOP/lib/iioporb.*: Added a singleton typedef for the ORB which
 	is what CORBA_ORB_init() will now return.  Modified
 	string_to_object() so that it sets the ORB on the CORBA_Object
 	that it returns.
	
	* IIOP/lib/{iiopobj,nvlist}.h: Added some responsive commentary.

	* IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Modified connection establishment code in
 	GIOP::Invocation::start() to utilize the client connection manager
 	in the ORB.

	* IIOP/lib/giop.h: Put a TAO_Client_Connection_Handler* into
 	GIOP::Invocation in place of the client_endpoint.

	* IIOP/lib/factories.*: Updated explicit template instantiations,
 	added TAO_Client_Connection_Handler.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.*: Renamed things--ROA_Parameters -->
 	TOA_OA_Parameters, ROA_Handler --> TOA_OA_Connection_Handler.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.h: Moved TAO_Object_Table into objtable.*, added
 	comments where appropriate.

	* IIOP/lib/{any,cdr,iioporb,invoke}.*: Re-formatting and creation
 	of inline method file.

Tue May 13 21:51:22 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Continued to update the format of the TAO source code so that it
 	  will be consistent with the style used in ACE.

Mon May 12 17:02:29 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/roa.*: Moved short method into an inline file.
  	Miscellaneous reformatting.  Adjustment to new type names
 	(prefaced by TAO_ for namespace protection).
	
	* IIOP/lib/object.*: Moved short methods into an inline file.
  	Changed lookup()/register_op() to find()/bind() for consistency
 	with established ACE APIs.  Miscellaneous reformatting.

	* IIOP/lib/iiopobj.*: Moved short methods into an inline file.
  	Added CTOR for IIOP::Version and IIOP::ProfileBody.  Added
 	convenience CTOR for IIOP_Object where the profile can be
 	supplied.  Miscellaneous reformatting.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.*: Moved short methods into an inline file.  Changed
 	lookup()/register_obj() to find()/bind() for consistency with
 	established ACE APIs.

	* headers: Added comments to force C++ mode in emacs for header
	files, and changed SCCS version tag info to RCS version tag info.

Wed May  7 14:49:46 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/corbacom.cpp: Some bugs from the CORBA_String_var class
	have been fixed. Thanks to Brian Mendel for noticing these.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: In CORBA_BOA::dispatch, the opname local
	variable of type CORBA_String_var is changed to be of type
	CORBA_String. This was because the String_var class would assume
	ownership of the quantity assigned and delete it. Thanks again to
	Brian Mendel for noticing this.

Tue May  6 14:06:49 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/boa.hh: the register_obj's 2nd argument is changed from
	CORBA_Object_ptr& to CORBA_Object_ptr

	* IIOP/lib/object.hh: the return type for register_op method on
	CORBA_Object is changed from void to int to be consistent.

	Added a new method "get_subclass" to CORBA_Object that returns a
	pointer to the subclass. Typeically, this would be pointer to an
	object that implements an interface.

	* IIOP/lib/objtable.{hh,cpp}: @nd argument of register_obj changed
	from CORBA_Object_ptr& to CORBA_Object_ptr.

	* IIOP/lib/orb.hh: the type signature of "skeleton" is changed to
	take CORBA_Object_ptr rather than CORBA_Object_ptr& as its 2nd argument.

Mon May  5 20:28:54 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: commented out code that uses the "void
	*context" field. It doesn't make any sense to have it.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.hh: Added 2 pure virtual methods (shutting_down and
	clean_shutdown).
	
	In addition, the "register_obj" method was added. It was missing before.
	
	* IIOP/lib/corbacom.cpp: String_var's constructor bug is fixed. It
	was trying to free storage that was never allocated.

	* IIOP/lib/iiopobj.{hh,cpp}: Added a method - "get_name" that
	retrieves the object name.

	* IIOP/lib/object.{hh,cpp}: Added a method - "get_name" that
	retrieves the object's name or key. This is for debugging purposes.

	* IIOP/lib/orbobj.cpp: There was an infinite loop in parsing the
	options to BOA_init. Fixed.

	* IIOP/lib/stub.hh: Added the "get_name" virtual method.

Sat May  3 22:45:23 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Added code temporarily that invokes the
	skeleton that is looked up. We still need to add code that will
	handle the case when no match is found on the operation names.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.hh: The register_obj method on TAO_Object_Table
	now returns an integer indicating status of registering (-1 =>
	failure, 0 for success).

	* IIOP/lib/object.hh: The register_op method on
	TAO_Operation_Table now returns an integer code (O for success, -1
	for failure).

	* IIOP/lib/objtable.{hh,cpp}: The register_obj method returns an
	integer code representing either success or failure.

	* IIOP/lib/optable.{hh,cpp}: Added new files that implement
	concrete strategies for operation name lookup.

Fri May  2 08:48:29 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/object.hh: Modified the signature of register_op on
	TAO_Operation_Table to take a second argument to be a pointer to
	the actual skeleton. 

	Thanks to Brian Mendel for reporting this.

Thu May  1 16:46:11 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/object.{hh,cpp}: Added a method that can set the parent
	pointer. 

	* IIOP/lib/params.cpp: A hook has been provided in ROA_Factory to
	enable the user to use a user-defined demux strategy.

Wed Apr 30 22:00:51 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/objtable.{hh,cpp}: Added two new files that define
	different object demultiplexing strategies. 

	* IIOP/lib/Makefile: Added objtable as additional source file to compile.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Provided the default destructor for the
	TAO_Object_Table. 

	* IIOP/lib/boa.cpp: Provided the default destructor for the
	TAO_Operation_Table.

	* IIOP/lib/orbobj.cpp: Added support for the -OAtablesize option
	in the call to CORBA_ORB::BOA_init method.

	* IIOP/lib/params.{hh,i,cpp}: Added support to ROA_Factory to return
	a specific object lookup strategy.

	*IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: The ROA constructor initializes its "objtable_"
	private data member with the object lookup strategy returned by
	ROA factory.

Tue Apr 29 11:52:48 1997  Aniruddha Gokhale  <gokhale@mambo.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/any.hh: Moved CORBA_Any_ptr declaration to orb.hh.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.{hh,cpp}: Renamed BOA to CORBA_BOA. The CORBA_BOA class
	maintains a pointer to an abstract TAO_ObjectTable class. Concrete
	classes inheriting from TAO_ObjectTable will provide strategies
	for lookup.

	Added virtual functions to do dispatch based on object key. In
	addition, added a lookup method based on object key that delegates
	the task of looking the object to the object table it maintains.

	Changed the signature of typedef CORBA_BOA::dsi_handler to be pointer to
	member function of class CORBA_BOA. Eventually, this will point to
	the dispatch method of class CORBA_BOA.

	Moved "struct Dispatch_Context" from roa.hh to boa.hh since we
	want BOA to be a full fledged OA eventually and not remain an
	abstract class as it is now. All other OA's such as ROA inherit
	from BOA and only add extra functionality.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.cpp: There was a syntax error (missing comma)
	in one of the ACE_DEBUG statements which has been fixed.

	* IIOP/lib/corbacom.{hh,cpp}: Added class CORBA_String_var as well
	as the CORBA compliant CORBA_string_dup.

	* IIOP/lib/except.hh: Moved CORBA_Exception_ptr declaration to orb.hh.

	* IIOP/lib/object.hh: Added an abstract class
	TAO_Operation_Table. CORBA_Object maintains a pointer to this
	abstract class. The IDL compiler will eventually generate concrete
	classes that employ different lookup strategies for operation name
	lookup.

	* IIOP/lib/orb.hh: Added forward declarations to all CORBA_*
	classes. In addition, moved all the CORBA_*_ptr declarations here.

	* IIOP/lib/orbobj.{hh,cpp}: Added the CORBA compliant BOA_init
	method to class CORBA_ORB. Users can now pass arguments to
	BOA_init. Eventually, we want to make this method return any of
	the specialized OA's depending on the arguments. Right now, we get
	a pointer to the ROA. 

	* IIOP/lib/params.{hh,i}: Added some more methods and enum
	declarations to the ROA_PARAMS singleton. 

	* IIOP/lib/principa.hh: Moved the CORBA_Principal_ptr declaration
	to orb.hh.

	* IIOP/lib/roa.{hh,cpp}: Moved some functionality to boa.hh. ROA
	is now only a specialized form of BOA.

	* IIOP/lib/stub.hh: Moved the typedef for "skeleton" to orb.hh.

	* IIOP/lib/svrrqst.{hh,cpp}: Had to rename BOA to CORBA_BOA.

	* IIOP/lib/typecode.hh: Moved the CORBA_TypeCode_ptr declaration
	to orb.hh.

Tue Apr 22 23:30:19 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/connect.cpp (open): Added log message.

	* IIOP/lib/params.cpp (concurrency_strategy): Uses reactive
 	strategy when appropriate.

	* IIOP/lib/params.hh: Reactive strategy added.

Tue Apr 22 21:03:15 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Changed erroneous ACE_GUARD calls to ACE_GUARD_RETURN
 	calls.

Tue Apr 22 16:15:52 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Removed more POSIX thread calls.

	* IIOP/lib/invoke.cpp: Changed ForceSynchronousCancellation to
 	ACE_Synchronous_Cancellation_Required and made it use the ACE_OS
 	calls.

	* IIOP/lib/{typecode,svrrqst,request,principa,orbobj,nvlist,iiopobj,giop,except,any}.*:
 	Removed all vestiges of pthread mutexes...they are now
 	ACE_Thread_Mutexes.  This will likely have to change if we want to
 	compile something completely devoid of threads, but that's another
 	day.  Also, the mutexes have moved from being globals to being
 	members on the respective classes.  No files should be dependent
 	on thread.hh any longer.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.cpp (open): Removed code obsoleted by use of
 	the Strategy_Acceptor.

	* IIOP/lib/{roa.cpp,connect.cpp},IIOP/tests/svr.cpp: Changes to
 	use new singletons described below.

	* IIOP/lib/params.*: Changed ROA_Parameters and ROA_Factory to use
 	ACE_Singleton<>.  The singleton types are now named ROA_PARAMS and
 	ROA_FACTORY.

Mon Apr 21 23:44:34 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/lib/roa.cpp (ROA): Changed spelling of clientAcceptor_ to
 	client_acceptor_ to be consistent with ACE style conventions.

Mon Apr 21 10:52:42 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/test/clnt.cpp: Moved call to CORBA_ORB_init() prior to the
 	parsing of the command line args.  This got switched around during
 	porting to VxWorks.

	* IIOP/lib/roa.cpp: Changed calls using clientAcceptor_to use APIs
 	vended by ACE_Strategy_Acceptor.

	* IIOP/lib/roa.hh: Moved default thread flags into ROA_Factory.

	* IIOP/lib/params.*: Added ROA_Factory, a singleton which is the
 	beginning of an abstract factory dynamically producing runtime
 	strategies based on information found in ROA_Parameters.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.cpp: Added call to ROA_Handler's base class
 	CTOR in initializer list.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.hh: Changed ROA_Handler's CTOR so that it can
 	take an optional ACE_Thread_Manager* arg.  This makes it
 	compatible with the CTORs for the base class.  Also changed base
 	class for ROA_Acceptor to ACE_Strategy_Acceptor.

	* IIOP/lib/svrrqst.*: Changed references to BOA_ptr from TOA_ptr.

	* IIOP/lib/connect.*: ROA_Handler/ROA_Acceptor moved from roa.*
 	into here.

	* IIOP/lib/params.*: ROA_Parameters moved from roa.* into here.

	* IIOP/lib/boa.*: What used to be TOA is now BOA, and lives in
 	here.

	* IIOP/lib/roa.*: Major restructuring required removal of all
 	classes (see other log entries) from here.  This file now houses
 	only the ROA class.

	* IIOP/lib/{tcpoa.*,toa.*}: Removed because of name changes from
 	TCP_OA->ROA and TOA->BOA.

Fri Apr 18 08:09:19 1997  Brian Mendel   <bmendel@mdc.com>

	* cdr.hh,corbacom.{hh,cpp},giop.cpp,marshall.cpp,typecode.cpp:
 	Changes required for WChar missed in earlier committed code.
	
	* connmgr.cpp: Changes required for select statement.
	
	* nvlist.cpp: Conditional include for memory.h added.  VxWorks
 	does not have memory.h.

	* object.cpp: Added conditional for VXWORKS to define
 	IID_IUnknown.
	
	* orbconf.hh: Minor tuning of the configuration file.
	
	* tcpoa.{hh,cpp}: Added VXWORKS conditional includes.

	* toa.cpp: Added VXWORKS conditional includes.


Mon Apr 15 17:01:00 1997  Brian Mendel  <bmendel@mdc.com>

	* roa.cpp: Added return statement to ROA_Handler::open(void*)
 	method.
	
	* giop.cpp: Modified giop::read_buffer to replace undefined fc
 	with peer.get_handle().  Modified giop::incoming_message method
 	parameter list to match function prototype exactly.
	
	* tcpoa.cpp: Replaced fd instances in debug messages with
 	peer.get_handle() calls.

Mon Apr 14 13:45:54 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* roa.{hh,i,cpp},tcpoa.cpp,svr.cpp: Replaced ACE_ROA with
 	ROA_Parameters, which is a GoF-style singleton.

Sun Apr 13 00:01:56 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* roa.cpp: Fix continuation condition in ROA_Handler::svc()'s loop
 	so that it doesn't stop after one iteration.  Also added some
 	debug messages.

	* giop.cpp: Fixed some returns being called with no value.  This
 	should have been caught in the previous round of changes.

Sat Apr 12 23:10:08 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* tcpoa.{hh,cpp}: TCP_OA::handle_message() now returns a value
 	indicating how a message was handled.

	* roa.cpp: ROA_Handler::handle_input() now returns a meaningful
 	value based on what TCP_OA::handle_message() returns.

	* giop.{hh,cpp}: Added end-of-file detection on socket
 	connections, and that is now propagated all the way back up
 	through GIOP::incoming_message().  I don't know if I violated
 	something in the spec by doing this, but it was necessary.  I'll
 	look into it later.

Thu Apr 10 11:49:44 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* giop.{hh,cpp}: Overloaded all methods dealing with connections
 	so that there are two, one taking a file descriptor as argument,
 	the other taking an ACE_SOCK_Stream.  Right now, the *_Stream
 	version simply forwards to the fd-based one.  I would have
 	preferred to get rid of the fd-based methods altogether, but we've
 	only converted the server runtime; the client is still using the
 	original sun code, which is effectively fd-based.  In the course
 	of doing this, I also simplified the decls for incoming_message by
 	creating typedefs for some of the function pointers passed as
 	args.

	* orbconf.hh: Fixed the stupid auto-endian-ness detector
 	AGAIN...had my logic reversed!

	* roa.cpp: Adjusted code in accordance with changes to tcpoa.hh.

	* tcpoa.hh: Moved and renamed TCP_OA::dispatch_context to be
 	::Dispatch_Context, and changed its endpoint member to be an
 	ACE_SOCK_Stream.

	* roa.hh: Fixed handle_input() to use the underlying peer() data
 	member for reading data, rather than using its argument.  This is
 	so that when a different thread handles each connection,
 	handle_input() can simply be called repeatedly by svc().

Wed Apr  9 16:19:21 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tcpoa.cpp: Fixed a problem that G++ didn't notice regarding
 	changing the notion of endpoints in servers from server_endpoint
 	to an ACE_HANDLE.

Wed Apr  9 15:43:37 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* svr.cpp: The -p option is gone, and -e takes its place and is
 	required.  This requires the user to specify not only the port
 	number, but also the IP address of on which the server should
 	listen for requests.  See ACE_INET_Addr documentation for valid
 	string formats for addresses.  Also, the -t option sets the "use
 	threads" global.

	* orbconf.hh: Hopefully resolved the tension between MS and Unix
 	platforms in inferring endian-ness of the target platform based on
 	preprocessor defines.  We now check for i386, _M_X86, and vax
 	(yeah, like we really worry about that, but it's easy to do).

	* roa.{hh,i,cpp}: Added support for spawning threads to handle
 	incoming requests.  This involves a state flag for whether or not
 	to use threads, calling activate() in ROA_Handler::open() if that
 	flag is set, and creating ROA_Handler::svc() that simply loops
 	calling handle_input().

	* IIOP/test/svr.cpp: Moved setting of upcall(), forwarder(),
 	context(), etc. into here rather than in TCP_OA::TCP_OA(), which
 	is where I mistakenly stuck them a few days ago (duh!).

	* IIOP/lib/tcpoa.cpp: Removed setting of ACE_ROA::upcall(), which belongs
 	in the server code.  I got confused because the function names
 	were so similar: tcpoa.cpp contains ::tcp_oa_dispatcher(), and
 	svr.cpp contains ::tcpoa_dispatch().

	* IIOP/lib/roa.{hh,i,cpp}: Added forwarding function to ACE_ROA global namespace
 	hack.

	* IIOP/lib/orbconf.hh: Fixed preprocessor checks that auto-detect
 	endian-ness of this processor.

	* IIOP/test/test1_{clnt,svr}.cpp: THESE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO
 	USE ACE EVENT HANDLING!!  This round of changes explicitly
 	instantiates templates where required.

	* IIOP/test/svr.cpp: Global function ::OA_listen() no longer
 	exists; its functionality is now fully contained within ::main().
  	If USE_ACE_EVENT_HANDLING is defined, a Reactor-based event loop
 	is used.  The original intent was to allow conditional compilation
 	to select btw. the original method and a Reactor-based method.
  	However, weaving that into the library proved far more difficult
 	than anticipated, so more than likely not defining
 	USE_ACE_EVENT_HANDLING will cause massive grief.

	* IIOP/lib/toa.cpp: Changed call to TCP_OA::init() to reflect new
 	ACE_INET_Addr argument type.

	* IIOP/lib/tcpoa.cpp (TCP_OA): All initialization methods were
 	changed, specifically the CTOR and TCP_OA::init, to reflect the
 	introduction of ACE_INET_Addr.  Two side-effects of using
 	ACE_INET_Addr are that (1) a server can specify the address on
 	which it wants to listen and (2) best that I can tell, the server
 	MUST specify the address on which it wants to listen because
 	otherwise it won't be able to publish a rational IOR.  The event
 	loop is now changed to simply loop on Reactor::handle_events().

	* IIOP/lib/tcpoa.hh (TCP_OA): Removed vestiges of this component's
 	use of the original connection management scheme.  Where
 	appropriate, hostnames and ports were replaces by ACE_INET_Addr,
 	endpoints by ACE_HANDLEs, etc.  One particularly nasty thing done
 	was to declare ROA_Handler as a friend so that handle_message()
 	can be called from ROA_Handler::handle_input(), which to me
 	exposes a hole in the original architecture wherein input is
 	"pulled" rather than waited-for.  We might need to re-think how
 	this is handled within TAO.

	* IIOP/lib/roa.{hh,i,cpp}: These files contain the required
 	components to support the new server-side ACE-based
 	connection/event substrate.  The client side remains, as always,
 	using the connection mgmt scheme used by the original Sun IIOP
 	code.

	* IIOP/lib/giop.cpp: Added explicit template instantiation for
 	when this is needed.

	* IIOP/lib/corbacom.hh: Now protects itself from multiple
 	inclusion.

	* IIOP/lib/Makefile: Added roa.* where appropriate.

Wed Mar 19 10:25:21 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* IIOP/docs/us/codecount/*.count: Added to repository.

	* Makefile: Added to repository.

	* IIOP/objbase.h: Moved to IIOP/compat.

	* IIOP/initguid.h: Moved to IIOP/compat.

Thu Mar 13 14:06:28 1997  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ChangeLog: Added the ChangeLog.
