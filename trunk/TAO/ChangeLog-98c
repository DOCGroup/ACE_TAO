	* TAO_IDL/be/be_visitor_operation/operation_cs.cpp:

	After the call to do_static_call, we were not checking if some
	exception was raised. This was causing major problems if there was
	any post do_static_call processing such as narrowing to be
	done. Thanks to Seth Widoff for reporting the problem.

Sun Jun 28 21:33:48 1998  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: replaced ACE_SYNCH_RW_MUTEX with
          ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX so that it will compile with g++
          (and be correct :-).

        * tests/OctetSeq/OctetSeq.cpp (main): changed loop index
          i from u_int to int to avoid signed/unsigned comparison.

Sun Jun 28 16:10:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/NestedUpcalls/Triangle_Test/Makefile: Added
          this Makefile for use on Unix machines.

Sun Jun 28 15:30:00 1998  Michael Kircher  <mk1@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tao/GIOP.cpp: In method location_forwarding, removed
          the explicit release of the IIOP_Object. It is implicitly
          released by the release of the CORBA::OBject pointer.

        * tests/Quoter/Generic_Factory_Impl.{h,cpp}: Splitted
          the create_object method into two parts.

Sat Jun 27 18:13:05 1998  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * TAO/tests/POA/Explicit_Activation/server.cpp (main): Changed
          #include "ace/Timeprobes.h" to #include "tao/Timeprobes.h".
