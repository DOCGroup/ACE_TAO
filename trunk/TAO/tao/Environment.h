//   Declare the CORBA_Environment class.
//   Note that this header file only requires a few forward
//   declarations of CORBA classes, this is *very* important because
//   even the ORB needs to know about it; make your changes with care.
//   It is also a good idea trying to minimize cross dependencies
//   between header files.

  //
  // = DESCRIPTION 
  //
  //   A CORBA_Environment is a way to automagically ensure that
  //   exception data is freed -- the "var" class for Exceptions.  It
  //   adds just a bit of convenience function support, helping
  //   classify exceptions as well as reducing memory leakage.
  // 
  //   The thread has a default environment to simplify porting
  //   between platforms that support native C++ exceptions and those
  //   that don't. This is a TSS resource (always), but with a twist:
  //   if the user creates a new environment the old one is "pushed"
  //   (actually the new one remembers it), eventually the new
  //   environment destructor pops itself from the stack and we
  //   recover the old environment.
  //   This means that if the user create a new environment and
  //   somebody calls a function using the default one the exception
  //   will still be received in the environment created by the user.
  //   The only drawback is that environments life time must nest
  //   properly, this shouldn't be a problem because environments are
  //   usually created on the stack, but, the spec allows their
  //   creation on the heap and/or as class members; we need to
  //   investigate the tradeoffs and take a decision.
  //
