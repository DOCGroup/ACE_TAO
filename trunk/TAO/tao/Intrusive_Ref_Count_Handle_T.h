/**
 * @class TAO_Intrusive_Ref_Count_Handle<T>
 *
 * @brief Template class for smart-pointer to (intrusively) ref-counted object.
 *
 *  This class behaves just like a xxx_var type behaves.  The only significant
 *  difference is that this class provides a "bool is_nil() const" method,
 *  and xxx_var types don't (they use the "bool CORBA::is_nil(xxx_ptr ptr)"
 *  method instead). For example,
 *
 *  typedef TAO_Intrusive_Ref_Count_Handle<PortableServer::ServantBase>
 *      MyServantBase_var;
 *
 *  The MyServantBase_var and the PortableServer::ServantBase_var are
 *  nearly idenitical.  The only difference is that the MyServantBase_var
 *  has a "isNil()" method that indicates whether or not the smart pointer
 *  is in the 'nil' state or not.
 *
 *  This class can be used to "safely" deal with an instance of a servant.
 *  For example, we can use a single variable
 *  TAO_Intrusive_Ref_Count_Handle<Foo_i>
 *
 *      typedef TAO_Intrusive_Ref_Count_Handle<Foo_i> Foo_i_var;
 *      Foo_i_var servant_;
 *
 *  instead of using two variables
 *
 *      PortableServer::ServantBase_var servant_holder_;
 *      Foo_i* servant_;

 *  to deal with the servant memory.
 *
 *  The Foo_i_var type does everything that the PortableServer::ServantBase_var
 *  type does. In addition, the Foo_i_var type can provide access to the servant
 *  as derived class via the arrow operator.
