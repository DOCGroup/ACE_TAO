RTCORBA Subsetting Plan, Status, and Notes

In this file, we're keeping track of the status of the subsetting
of RTCORBA and its effect on TAO files.

The steps of the subsetting process are the following:

1.  Separate out all TAO_HAS_RT_CORBA blocks from non RTCORBA code
    within tao and tao/PortableServer.  As a style, we'll be adding
    RT_ in front of the files that we create in tao that will be
    eventually moved to tao/RTCORBA.

2.  Once everything is cleanly separated, we'll move all of the
    RT_ files at once to tao/RTCORBA and make a separate DLL for it.

The reasoning for this two step process is:

1.  To enable the subsetting while bugs are fixed for TAO 1.2 and
    minimize the number of merges.

2.  To enable RTCORBA subsetting changes to be made available
    sooner for more testing.

NOTE: We might shuold do some more refactoring in the Invocation and Invocation
      selectors. Right now the selector do more than just selecting, they select,
      and performa call back on the invocation object.
      We might could add a new class that uses the enpoint selectors to select
      the right endpoint, and at the same time, it calls back the invocation, to
      perform the invocation on the selected endpoint.

RTCORBA DLL registration hooks

The purpose of this section is to document all of the hooks that the RTCORBA
library needs to register.

1.  Invocation Endpoint Selector Factory - currently hardcoded in a
    TAO_HAS_RT_CORBA block in ORB_Core.cpp
