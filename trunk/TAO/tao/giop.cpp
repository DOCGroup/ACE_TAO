// GIOP:	Utility routines for sending, receiving GIOP messages
//
// Note that the Internet IOP is just the TCP-specific mapping of the
// General IOP.  Areas where other protocols may map differently
// include use of record streams (TCP has none), orderly disconnect
// (TCP has it), endpoint addressing (TCP uses host + port), security
// (Internet security should be leveraged by IIOP) and more.
//
// NOTE: There are a few places where this code knows that it's really
// talking IIOP instead of GIOP.  No rush to fix this so long as we
// are really not running atop multiple connection protocols.
//
// THREADING NOTE: currently, the connection manager eliminates tricky
// threading issues by providing this code with the same programming
// model both in threaded and unthreaded environments.  Since the GIOP
// APIs were all designed to be reentrant, this makes threading rather
// simple!
//
// That threading model is that the thread making (or handling) a call
// is given exclusive access to a connection for the duration of a
// call, so that no multiplexing or demultiplexing is needed.  That
// is, locking is at the "connection level" rather than "message
// level".
//
// The down side of this simple threading model is that utilization of
// system resources (mostly connections, but to some extent network
// I/O) in some kinds of environments can be inefficient.  However,
// simpler threading models are much easier to get properly debugged,
// and often perform better.  Also, such environments haven't been
// seen to be any kind of problem; the model can be changed later if
// needed, it's just an internal implementation detail.  Any portable
// ORB client is not allowed to rely on semantic implications of such
// a model.
//
// XXX there is lots of unverified I/O here.  In all cases, if an
// error is detected when marshaling or unmarshaling, it should be
// reported.
