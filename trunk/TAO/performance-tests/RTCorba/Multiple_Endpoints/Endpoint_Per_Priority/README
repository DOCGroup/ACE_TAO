// $Id$

This directory contains programs for measuring performance with
the endpoint per priority scenario (described below).

Server establishes several endpoints (see -ORBEndPoint option), each
with a different priority (i.e., serviced by threads with different
priorities), creates a Test object and exports its ior.  Client runs
the specified number of threads at specified priorities (see command
line arguments description below), with each thread invoking
operations on the ior exported by the server.  However, because the
ClientPriorityPolicy is set in the client, the ORB picks which server
endpoint should be used based on the priority of the invoking thread,
i.e., it picks a server endpoint which has the same priority as the
invoking thread.  (We try to preserve the priority of the requests n
to n).

See run-test.pl for a sample run.  (Perl script starts a server, and
then runs a client with 5 low-priority threads and one high-priority thread).

Command Line Arguments
**********************

server

-o <ior_output_file>      Name of the file where to store IOR of the server.

client

-i <ior>                  IOR of the object to use for invocations.

-n <number of iterations> Number of invocations each thread must
                          perform on the object.

-p <period>               Period with which invocations should be made.

-t <corba_priority>       Specify a corba priority of a a client
                          thread to run.  This option can be used
                          multiple times in order to specify the
                          number of threads in the client and their priorities.
