This directory contains a number of tests that illustrate the
performance of TAO and other ORBs.  The individual directories contain
READMEs on how to run the following performance tests:

        . Cubit

          This directory contains performance tests for COOL,
          CORBAplus, Hardpack, Orbix, TAO, and VisiBroker.  These
          tests measure the latency, jitter, CPU utilization, and
          priority inversion of these ORBs.

        . Demux  (*NOTE* This is still under development)

          This tests various demultiplexing strategies used in TAO.

        . Thruput

          Throughput tests for TAO, VisiBroker, and Orbix based on
          TTCP.

        . RTCorba

          Tests for various real-time features (RT CORBA spec & TAO-specific).
