This directory contains a number of tests that illustrate the
performance of TAO and other ORBs.  The individual directories contain
READMEs on how to run the following performance tests:

        . Cubit

          This directory contains performance tests for TAO that
          measure the latency, jitter, CPU utilization, and
          priority inversion of these ORBs.

        . Latency

          A set of performance tests that measure throughput, latency
          and jitter.

        . POA
        
          Various tests of the TAO's POA performance.

        . Pluggable

          The tests in this directory time the latency contributed by
          various parts of the ORB, but mostly the emphasis is on the
          contribution due to the pluggable protocols code.  

        . RTCorba

          Tests for various (TAO-specific) real-time features. Tests
          for RT CORBA spec real-time features can be found in
          $TAO_ROOT/tests/RTCORBA.

        . Throughput

          Throughput tests (bytes per second) for TAO.
