This example uses the TAO IDL compiler to generate the SII stubs and
skeletons.  You can either run the server in the background in the
same window as the client or open a separate window for the client and
server.

The collocation_test demonstrates how the performance improves when
objects are collocated.  The test runs both server and client in
different threads.  To run it, simply run collocation_test.  It
accepts any command line arguments for the client side, but there is
not way to specify command line arguments for the server side at this
moment.  This may be changed in the future.  At this moment, the
collocation_test must use Naming_Service to resolve object
references.  This may be changed later, also.

NOTES: The IDL_Cubit server used to run a Naming Service so the client
        could easily locate it.  This proved too problematic, the test
        required a complete compilation of the orbsvcs library and was
        not reliable. The preferred method is to use a file to pass
        the factory IOR between the server and the client.

server:
-------

% server [-ORBhost <serverhost>] [-ORBport <portnum>]
         [-d] [-o <ior_output_file>]

Options:
-------
-d       Debug flag (It is additive more -d flags will increase
         the debugging level).

-o       Outputs the cubit_factory IOR to a file.

When the server is started and you have used the -d flag, you should
see as the first line of output something that looks like the follow:

        iiop:1.0//swarm:10015/Persistent/886013035/850128/RootPOA/RootPOA_is_BAD/factory
        (-ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
        IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745...
        (-ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  It is additive, i.e., the more
-d options provided, the more debugging you get.  At the moment, only
2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d options are
silently ignored.

client:
-------

% client [-d] [-x] <-f cubit_factory_ior_file> <-k cubit_factory_ior>  -n <iterations>

Options:
-------
-d      Debug flag
-x      Tells the server to shutdown.
-f      Reads the cubit factory IOR from the file
-k      Reads the cubit factory IOR from commandline
-n      no. of iterations

The following are the three ways of giving the CubitFactory IOR to the
client:

        1. From a file using the -f option. (This file can be produced using
                the -o option of the server.)

        2. Directly on the commandline using the -k option.

        3. Get it from the Naming Service (which is the default client
           behavior).

collocation_test:
-----------------

        This test demonstrates how collocation optimization improve
performance of collocated objects.  Run the test without any argument
to see results with collocation optimization.  Run it with
<-ORBcollocation no> to perform the same test without the optimization.


run_test.pl:
------------

        This is a perl script which simplifies the execution of the
test.

run_test [-h] [-n num] [-mcast] [-sleeptime t] [-debug] [-release]

-h                  -- prints this information
-n num              -- client uses <num> iterations
-mcast              -- uses the multicast version of the nameservice
-sleeptime t        -- run_test should sleep for <t> seconds between running
                       the server and client
-debug              -- sets the debug flag for both client and server
-release            -- runs the Release version of the test (for NT use)
                       (default is 3 seconds)


Sample Run, Using files to communicate IOR:
------------------------------------------

1. Start the server.

% server -ORBport 20000 -ORBobjrefstyle url -o theior

        IDL_Cubit:SERVER

The IOR is: <iiop:1.0//tango:20000/Persistent/887665222/647179/RootPOA/RootPOA_is_BAD/factory\00\00>

2. Start the client.

%client -ORBport 19998 -f theior

         IDL_Cubit: client

Factory received OK
.
.
.


Sample Run, passing the IOR on the command line, on VxWorks:
------------------------------------------------------------
    -> ld < server
    -> spa main, "-ORBobjrefstyle", "url"
            IDL_Cubit: server

    The IOR is: <iiop:1.0//samba:1028/U/child_poa/factory>

    -> ld < client
    -> spa main, "-k", "iiop:1.0//samba:1028/U/child_poa/factory"
    Enter <number> to select, anything else to stop: 2

The IOR provided to the client is the IOR that the server printed out.
Be sure to replace the <> with "".


Using JAVA to access the IDL Cubit test:
----------------------------------------

install JDK1.2
install Java to IDL compiler

copy the following files:
cp $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/CosNaming.idl .
cp $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Simulator/DOVEBrowser/NS_Resolve.java .

Compile:
javatoidl cubit.idl
javatoidl CosNaming.idl
javac *.java

Run:
java IDL_Cubit_Client


Running IDL_Cubit on CHORUS:
--------------------------

1.You should make sure that you set the HOST environment variable on the
Chorus VME Board to the IP address of that Board before you run
MT_Cubit test.

e.g.,
$rsh tambora1 setenv HOST 128.252.165.82

2. You should make sure that the path to IOR file has write permission
for ALL.

server:
------
$rsh host_name arun path_to_server -o path_to_ior_file -ORBdotteddecimaladdresses 1 <server_options>

You DONT have to use -ORBdotteddecimaladdresses 1 if you have
TAO_USE_DOTTED_DECIMAL_ADDRESSES defined in your config.h file.

e.g.,
$rsh tambora1 arun /IDL_Cubit/server  -o /ior
-ORBdotteddecimaladdresses 1 -ORBobjrefstyle url

client:
-------

$rsh host_name arun path_to_client -f path_to_ior_file <client_options>

e.g.,

$rsh tambora2 arun /IDL_Cubit/client -f /ior
