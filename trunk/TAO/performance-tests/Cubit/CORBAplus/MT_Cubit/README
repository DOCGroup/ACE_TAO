The MT-Cubit example
--------------------

Compiling
---------

Makefiles are provided. Use make to compile.

You can either run the server in the background in the same window as
the client or open a separate window for the client and server.

server:
-------

./svr -pbtrace

port_num is the port number at which the server will start the high
priority servant. The low priority servant will be created at
(port_num+1).

The server will print the IOR of the high and low priority servants,
but it is not required by the client.

client:
-------

./client -d <datatype> -n <num_calls> -t <num_threads> -pbtrace -pbinit Cubit iiop://<remoteHost>:<port>/Cubit00 

<datatype> is one of the following:

0 Octet
1 Short
2 Long
3 Struct of the above 3 types

<port_num> is the port number of the high priority servant. The low
priority servant is assumed to be at (port_num+1).

<server_hostname> is the hostname of the server.

Based on the server_hostname and the port_num, the client constructs
the IOR's for the high priority servant and the low priority servant.

<num_calls> is the number of CORBA twoway calls to be made

<num_threads> is the total number of concurrent clients to be
created. One of these clients will be a high priority client (and thus
send requests to the high priority servant), and the rest will have
low priority.

The high priority client makes requests at 20Hz, and the low priority
clients make requests at 10Hz.

Results
-------

The client prints the latency observed by the high priority client,
and the average latency observed by the low priority client.
