This is the cubit example that uses the TAO IDL compiler to generate
the stubs and skeletons. Additional features include presence of a
factory to create Cubit objects and testing the _bind call to get the
factory object reference.

You can either run the server in the background in the same window as
the client or open a separate window for the client and server.

server:
-------

% server [-d] [-ORBhost <serverhost>] [-ORBport <portnum>]
              [-n <number-of-cubit-objects>]

The server cubit factory maintained num_of_cubit objects (default =
1). They are assigned keys that look like "key0", "key1", ...

When the server is started and you have used the -d flag, you should
see as the first line of output something that looks like
	iiop:1.0//serverhost:10013/factory (using -ORBobjrefstyle url)
or
	IOR:000000000000001649444c3a43756269745... (using default -ORBobjrefstyle ior)

Using -d turns on debugging messages.  It is additive, i.e., the more
-d options provided, the more debugging you can get.  At the moment,
only 2 levels of debugging are implemented, and more than 2 -d options
are ignored.

client:
-------

% client [-d] -h <hostname> -p <port> -k <cubit key> -n <iterations>

cubit_key corresponds to "key0", "key1", ...
