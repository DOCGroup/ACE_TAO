Svc_Conf_[ly].cpp.diff are use to patch their respective files in
ACE_wrappers/ace.  They are used by Makefile in that directory, so
users don't ordinarily need to be concerned with them.

To update Svc_Conf_l.cpp.diff:

1) cd to ACE_wrappers/ace.
2) Create the old version of the file in Svc_Conf_l.cpp.orig.
   If you haven't created the new version (with make) after
   update Svc_Conf.l, you can copy Svc_Conf_l.cpp to it.
   Otherwise, you can retrieve it from the CVS repository.
3) % make       #### to create the new version of Svc_Conf_l.cpp
4) % diff -u Svc_Conf_l.cpp.orig Svc_Conf_l.cpp > ../etc/Svc_Conf_l.cpp.diff
5) % rm Svc_Con_l.cpp.orig
6) % cd ../etc
7) % cvs commit -ko -m'updated diff file' Svc_Conf_l.cpp.diff

And similarly for Svc_Conf_y.cpp.
