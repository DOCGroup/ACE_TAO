<B>What's here?</B>
<P>

<LI><A HREF="Examples">Examples</A>
<UL>
	Very rough proof of concept apps used during my
	ACE learning phase.  The stuff here was used as
	the stepping stone to create the initial Tutorials
</UL>

<LI><A HREF="tutorials">Tutorials</A>
<UL>
	A refinement of the Examples.  There are only a
	handfull of tutorials here but they should give
	you an idea of the direction I was taking.
</UL>

<LI><A HREF="Guidelines.html">Guidelines.html</A>
<UL>
	A rough-draft of guidelines for creating a new set
	of Tutorials more up to date and generally useful.

	This was to be a collection of mail messages relevant
	to our development process.  Since then, I've started
	filing everything in my personal mailbox...
	If this site begins to get a lot of traffic, I'll move
	this somewhere less intrusive.  (Likewise for the
	<i>acemail</i> file.)

<P>
Except for the Guidelines, all of what you see is very out
of date.  Probably on the order of a year or so.  Still,
the direction and goal remain the same:  create a set of
tutorials that can be used by experienced C++/OOP programmers
to learn the ACE framework.
<P>
I encourage any readers of this page to contact me if you have
suggestions or want to create a tutorial of your own.
During "normal business hours" (EST) you can get me quickest
at <A href="mailto:jcej@lads.com">jcej@lads.com</A>.
After dark & on the weekends you'll find
me at home:  <A HREF="jcej@tragus.org">jcej@tragus.org</A>.
Of course, I'm always checking the ACE mailing list.
<P>
