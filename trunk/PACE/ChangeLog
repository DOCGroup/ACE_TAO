	* ../pace/linux/README
	* ../pace/linux
	* ../pace/sunos/README
	* ../pace/sunos
	* ../pace/emulation
	 
	  Removed from reposistory.

	* ../pace/linux/TODO

	  Moved to ../pace/posix/TODO

	* ../pace/pace.dsw

	  Moved to ../pace/win32/pace.dsw.
	  Hi Darrell. This takes all traces of win32 stuff out of
	  the main dir and although its slightly different than
	  ace or tao, we are using our directories a little
	  differently here. Nanbor thought that is might be ok so
	  I will try it here until it breaks? or someone has good
	  reason to move it back.

Thu Jun  8 12:09:56 2000  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

	* pace/pace/sunos/*.{c,inl}:
          Removed files and put them in the posix subdirectory. 
	* pace/pace/linux/*.{c,inl}:
          Removed files and put them in the posix subdirectory. 
	* pace/pace/posix/*.{c,inl}:
          Added files from the linux/sunos subdirectories. (The files
          were identical from both directories aside from the $Id$ macro,
          i.e., the person who checked them in.)

Wed Jun  7 12:27:13 2000  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

	* Makefile:
	  Added Makefile for upper level pace directory.
        * pace/Makefile:
          Changed Makefile to fit in with the general makefile scheme in
          ACE and TAO.
        * config/compiler.h:
          Defined PACE_HAS_INLINE even for C files so that the functions
          will be directly added with the .h file.
        * tests/{Makefile,Stdio_Test.c,Posix_SP_Test.c}:
          Adding Makefile and tests to the tests directory.
