	* Makefile/libraries: Joe
	  One place of [.h] files. The makefile needs to determine
	  the correct platform and include {-I} the correct path
	  for the appropriate platform directory.

	* PACE_OS (/vxworks/win32: Luther)(/linux/sunos)

	  etc... These directories need to compile correctly under
	  the appropriate platform. For now, Andrew is porting
	  sunos and linux and I (Luther) am porting vxworks and
	  win32. We need to finish all the platforms quickly so
	  this should change daily. Especially once the Makefiles
	  work correctly.
	  
	* ACE_OS: Darrell and St. Louis team.
	  Darrell is breaking ACE_OS up. Joe, myself and the St.
	  Louis team needs to start implementing ACE_OS in terms
	  of PACE. We can do this directly in OS.h/inl/cpp as 
	  well as in the files that Darrell is subsetting ACE_OS
	  out into.

	* STL:
	  Eric and Bjorn are looking at the classes in ACE that use
	  the ACE containers. We are looking at the amount of work
	  and usefullness to be gained from changing the ACE
	  container interfaces to be consistent with the STL.
	
	* pace++:
	  Threads: Umar
	  IPC: Nortel

       * When compiling pace/pace/* files, all .o files all currently
         appear in the pace/pace directory. E.G.: pace/pace/sys/socket.c
         generates pace/pace/socket.o. This needs to be addressed
         concurrently as we build the pacelib and link to the rest of
         ace.
