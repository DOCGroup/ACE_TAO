This is POSIX ACE (PACE).  It is based on ACE, the Adaptive
Communications Environment, developed by Doug Schmidt and the
Distributed Object Computing Group at Washington University and the
University of California, Irvine.  Please see the ACE copyright
notice, available at
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/COPYING.

PACE is intended for lightweight and/or verified systems.  It offers
these benefits:

* A strict POSIX.1-like, low-level interface.  Its interface is "POSIX
  compatible"; by that we mean as close to POSIX.1 as it can be, given
  that PACE is not an operating system.  And, to avoid name conflicts
  with OS APIs, all low-level PACE function names have the pace_
  prefix.

* The low-level interface is partitioned into multiple files, one
  per POSIX.1 section.

* The low-level interface is written in C, so that it can be used in
  both C and C++ programs.

* PACE (on most platforms) does not require the use of multiple
  inheritance, static objects, exception handling, or other C++
  language constructs that impair code size and/or run-time performance.
