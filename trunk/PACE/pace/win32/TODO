	* ACE_wrappers/PACE/docs/PACE_POSIX_support.txt:

	  Please see this file. If a PACE file is not listed here,
	  it means the win32 funcs compile natively. The rest of
	  the files actually listed here describe whether native,
	  emulated or no supported exists for the funcs in the
	  file.

	  1. Please see the "not implemented" funcs and find a way
	     emulate them (or find native implementation).

	  2. Check that current emulation and native support is
	     correct via POSIX semantics (user feedback).

	* ACE_wrappers/PACE/tests/*:

	  3. Get these tests compiling and working on win32!
