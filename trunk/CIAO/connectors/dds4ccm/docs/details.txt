Currently the exact syntax of IDL3+ is not clear. The batch 4 document has
been outdated and we are waiting for a new batch 5. Before this will be
published a decision on IDL3+ has to be made. The latest proposal is to just
use templated modules, no templated interfaces. The usage of $ as
concatanation symbol has been removed from the spec.

A lis of all open issues can be found at:

The list of issues that have been resolved are in the DDS for CCM FTF
27Aug09 document in the same directory as this file.

One issue that has to be reraised is the fact that DDS SampleInfo is not
available at the CCM level, we need to have access to that.

The DDS4CCM spec still has to be reviewed whether the given ports deliver the
correct abstraction.

The CIAO tooling will generate the full connector. The goal is to have just
template instantiations and simple pass through code inside the connector, all
real code should be in a supporting core library. That makes it possible to
change the connector without changing the code generators.
