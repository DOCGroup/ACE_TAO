  <h1>General</h1>
  <p>
    This tutorial explains how to use a DDS4CCM connector in
    combination with a CCM component.<br/>
  </p>

  <h2>System</h2>
  <p>
    The system consists of three components:
    <ul>
      <li>A sender component</li>
      <li>A receiver component</li>
      <li>A controller component</li>
    </ul>
    Both the sender and receiver using a DDS4CCM connector. The controller runs a
    timer and periodically sends updates regarding location and size to the sender.

  <p>
    This tutorial runs in conjuntion with the RTI shapes demo
    (see <a href="./rti_shapes.html">this page<a/> how to run the
    RTI shapes demo).
  </p>

  <h2>Directory structure</h2>
  <p>
    The following convention is used:
    <ul>
      <li>|--<b>*_asm</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          : Directory contains an assembly.
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--<b>ports</b>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          : Directory contains common IDL code for the assembly.
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--<b>*_comp</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          : Directory contains an component.
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--
          <b>ports</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
           : Directory contains common IDL code for the component.
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <b>src</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          : Directory contains the IDL and *_exec-files for the component.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>File naming convention</h2>
  <p>
    The following convention is used:
    <ul>
      <li><b>*_defn.idl</b> - These files will contain definitions,
          like enumerations, constants and so on<br/>
          Typically located in *_asm/ports.
      </li>
      <li><b>*_msg.idl</b> - These files will contain the messages (data structure)
          send by DDS.<br/>
          Typically located in *_asm/ports.
      </li>
      <li><b>*_conn.idl</b> - These files will contain the connector
          declarations.<br/>
          Typically located in *_asm/ports.
      </li>
      <li><b>*_obj.idl</b> - These files will contain the interfaces between
          components.<br/>
          Typically located in *_asm/*_comp/ports.
      </li>
      <li><b>*_comp.idl</b> - These files will contain the component declaration.<br/>
          Typically located in *_asm/*_comp/src.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Additional conventions</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>MPC files are located in the same directory as the IDL and executor
          files.
      </li>
      <li>Files that were generated by the TOA IDL compiler or the RTI DDS gen
          compiler should be located in a subdirectory. In this tutorial the name
          of this subdirectory is &quot;GeneratedCode&quot;.
      </li>
