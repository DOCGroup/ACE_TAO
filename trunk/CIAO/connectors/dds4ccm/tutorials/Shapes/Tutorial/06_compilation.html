  <h1>Compilation and deployment<h2>

  <h2>Compilation</h2>
  <p>
    Once all the code has been written, compilation of the code would be the next
    step.<br/>
    MPC is used in order to create the Makefiles and projects files. All MPC files
    that are needed for this tutorial are in the same directory as the accompanying
    IDL and executor files.<br/>

    In order to make the GNU make files or the Visual Studio project files,
    the following steps should be performed :
    <ul>
      <li>Start a command shell and navigate to : <br/>
          <code>%CIAO_ROOT%/connectors/dds4ccm/tutorials/Shapes/Shapes_asm</code>
      </li>
      <li>Run<br/>
        <ul>
          <li><code>perl %ACE_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type vc9</code> to create Visual
              Studio 2008 project files.
          </li>
          <li><code>perl %ACE_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace</code> to create
              the GNU make files.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Now compile the code like you're used to.
        </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If all went well, all libraries are in the Shapes_asm/lib directory.
  </p>
  <h2>Deployment</h2>
  <p>
    Once all binaries are compiled, they're ready to be deployed. In this tutorial
    we are using DAnCE to deploy our system.<br/>
    DAnCE starts a system in two phases :
    <ol>
      <li>configuration_complete</li>
      <li>ccm_activate</li>
    </ol>
    DAnCE shuts down a system again in two phases :
    <ol>
      <li>passivate</li>
      <li>ccm_remove</li>
    </ol>
    Each component should have these four methods implemented. The business logic
    implemented in each step depends on you implementation.<br/>

    There're several processes taking care of the total deployment process.
    See the DAnCE documentation for more information about which processes there
    are and what their responsibilities are.<br/>
    DAnCE will start and shutdown a system with the aid of a deployment plan. A
    deployment plan describes which artifacts must run on which nodes and which
    components are connected to eachother via which interface (more on this later).
    All connections between components are made before 'configuration_complete' is
    called.
  <p>
    The deployment plan will be generated by the modelling tools but we take a
    brief look at the most important items of a deployment plan. A deployment plan
    is a XML based file which is devided into the following (main) sections:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Implementations</li>
      <li>Entry points</li>
      <li>Instances</li>
      <li>Connections</li>
      <li>Artifacts</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <b><i>All deployment code fragments mentioned in the rest of this tutorial are
    *NO* exports of any modelling tool.</i></b>

  <h3>Implementations and Entry Points</h3>
  <p>
    This defines which executor and servant artifacts (binaries) should be
    used. Implementations also defines which entry points in the binaries
    should be used. <a href="./Code/Deployment/implementation.cdp">This<a> file shows the
    implementation section of the controller.<br/>
    Beware that artifacts and entry points are exact otherwise deployment will
    fail.<br>
  </p>

  <h3>Instances</h3>
  <p>
    Instances define which artifacts run on which node. Every fysical artifact in
    the system results in one instance. The &lt;node&gt; section refers to the
    fysical node on which this instance will be deployed.<br/>
    An instance always refers to an implementation.
    It's possible that more than one instance refers to the same implementation.<br/>
    The instance section also provide the initial values of all attributes
    defined on the component.<br/>
    <a href="./Code/Deployment/instance.cdp">This</a> file shows the instance section of
    the controller.<br/>
  </p>

  <h3>Connections</h3>
  <p>
    A connection section defines which components are connected together.
    To define a connection one should know which type of DDS4CCM connector is used.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Example</b><br/>
    The sender component is connected to a DDS4CCM connector via the DDS_Write
    extented port of the DDS_Event basic port. The DDS_Write port for the
    DDS_Event connector is called 'supplier' and the Writer interface on this
    extented port is called 'data' (see ccm_dds.idl). In Shapes_Sender_comp.idl,
    the DDS_Write port is called 'info_write'. The DDS4CCM connector provide
    the writer interface, the Sender component uses this.<br/>
    The connection is 'local' since a connector and a component are always running
    in the same process.<br/>
    Now that we have got all the data we need to know to make a connection
    between the Sender and DDS4CCM connector regarding the writer port.<br/><br/>

    &lt;<b>connection</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>name</b>&gt;writer_connection&lt;<b>/name</b>&gt;
    <font color="grey">//unique name of the connection</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>deployRequirement</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>name</b>&gt;edu.dre.vanderbilt.DAnCE.ConnectionType&lt;<b>/name</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>resourceType</b>&gt;Local_Interface&lt;<b>/resourceType</b>&gt;
    <font color="grey">//The connection between the Sender and the DDS4CCM connector is 'local'</font><br/>

    <font color="grey">//First endpoint (the Sender component).</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="grey">//PortName is defined as follows</font><br/>

    name_of_interface_in_extended_port&gt;(see ccm_dds.idl)</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>portName</b>&gt;info_write_data&lt;<b>/portName</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>provider</b>&gt;false&lt;<b>/provider</b>&gt;
    <font color="grey">//The Sender component doens't provide the interface</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>kind</b>&gt;SimplexReceptacle&lt;<b>/kind</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>instance</b> xmi:idref="SenderComponentInstance" /&gt;
    <font color="grey">//Reference to the artifact (the Sender component instance in this case)</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>/internalEndpoint</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>internalEndpoint</b>&gt;
    <font color="grey">//First endpoint (the Sender component).</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="grey">//PortName is defined as follows</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="grey">//&lt;name_of_port_in_dds4ccm_connector&gt;_&lt;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>portName</b>&gt;supplier_data&lt;<b>/portName</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>provider</b>&gt;true&lt;<b>/provider</b>&gt;
    <font color="grey">//The DDS4CCM connector provides this interface</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>kind</b>&gt;Facet&lt;<b>/kind</b>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>instance</b> xmi:idref="Shapes_SenderConnectorInstance" /&gt;
    <font color="grey">//The reference to the connector instance.</font><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>/internalEndpoint</b>&gt;<br/>
    &lt;<b>/connection</b>&gt;<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a look at <a href="./Code/Deployment/connections.cdp">this</a> file to see which
    connection should be made by DAnCE in order to run the shapes system properly.
    Also take a look at the connection between the Controller and the Sender. This
    one is different because no DDS4CCM connector is used.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the deployment tools (in this case DAnCE) deploys this system, it'll connect
    all defined connectors before the system is started (i.e. before configuration_complete
    is called on a component).<br/>
  </p>
  <h4>Coding connections</h4>
  <p>
    Every component has got a context. The context is set by DAnCE and is
    the 'gateway' to all other component your component is connected to. The
    context caches all these connections so that the user doesn't need to
    cache those in his/her component.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><u>Sender</u></b><br/>
    The Sender uses the writer connection of the DDS_Write extented port of the
    DDS_Event basic port. The following code retrieves the connection to the
    Writer interface from the context.
    <br/>
    <code>::Shapes::ShapeType_conn::Writer_var writer =
      this->context_->get_connection_info_write_data ();</code>
    <br/>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><u>Controller</u></b><br/>
    The Controller uses the 'Control_obj' interface of the Sender component.
    Since this isn't a connection to a DDS4CCM connector, the code is rather
    simple. Looking at the IDL of the sender and receiver, the following code can be
    constructed in order to get the connection the Control_obj interface:
    <br/>
    <code>::Shapes::Control_obj_var control =
      this->context_->get_connection_control ();</code>
    <br/>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><u>Receiver</u></b><br/>
    The Receiver 'listens' to DDS and thus should provide a callback for the
    DDS4CCM connector. Please take a look at the generated code of the executor
    <a href="./Code/Shapes_Receiver_comp/Shapes_Receiver_comp_exec.cpp">code</a>
    of the receiver to see how this can be done.<br/>
    By default, a DDS4CCM connector is not listening so one should instruct the
    DDS4CCM connector to start listening to samples. Therefor
    a DataListenerControl interface (data_control) is available. The following
    code ensures that the DDS4CCM connector starts listening to the desired samples.
    <br/>
    <code>
      ::CCM_DDS::DataListenerControl_var lc =
      this->context_->get_connection_info_out_data_control ();<br/>
      lc->mode (::CCM_DDS::ONE_BY_ONE);<br/>
    </code><br/>
    This ensures that 'on_one_data' is gets invoked by the DDS4CCM connector
    for each sample.<br/>
    It's also possible to use ::CCM_DDS::MANY_BY_MANY. This will make sure that
    on_many_data on the listeners callback gets invoked by the DDS4CCM connector.<br/>
    To turn off listening, just call <code>lc->mode (::CCM_DDS::NOT_ENABLED);
    <br/>
  </p>

  <h3>Artifacts</h3>
