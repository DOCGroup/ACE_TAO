In order to use dds4ccm correctly, you must first create a PICML
model of the dds4ccm IDL files that can be used as a GME library
(called a PICML library from this point forward) for an project
that uses dds4ccm. The PICML library for dds4ccm needs to be created
only once and each time the IDL changes. To create the dds4ccm
PICML library, please execute steps:

%> cd $CIAO_ROOT
%> idl_to_picml -x dds4ccm -r connectors/dds4ccm/idl
%> mv dds4ccm.xme connectors/dds4ccm/models
