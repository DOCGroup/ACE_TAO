KeyedWriter tests the DDS_Writer. It tests write_one
and write_many, in combination with register_instance.

In descriptors/USER_QOS_PROFILE.xml, max_instances is
set to one. An exception should be thrown when the second
instance is registered. Every subsequent write of
unregistered keys, should result in an error.

When invoking write_many, writing the first sample should succeed.
Writing every subsequent sample should fail.
