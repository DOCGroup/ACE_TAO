This test tests the Getter.

Before the Sender starts writing samples to DDS, he informs the
Receiver (via a 'normal' CCM interface) about how many keys and
iterations to get from DDS. The receiver starts waiting on those
samples by calling get_one or get_many, using a timeout.
In the meantime the Sender will sleep for half a second before actual
writing the samples to DDS.
Once the DDS connector on the receiver side receives the written samples,
he should wake up and should return the samples to the user code.

To prevent deadlocks, both getting and writing takes place on the
ORB reactor thread.
