      The most basic of the Boeing scenarios that form part of the
OEP. This is done to illustrate how the OEP can be implemented using
CIAO. 

      This example does not yet use MPC to generate MSVC 
projects/workspaces/solutions or makefiles - we are still
working on getting the execution of the CIDL compiler
integrated into MPC. The CIDL compiler execution has
been added to MSVC projects, which for now are checked
into the CVS repository. CIDL compiler execution is not yet
integrated with makefiles. The CIDL compiler can be executed by
hand before starting the build for either this example or the
example in ACE_ROOT/TAO/CIAO/examples/OEP/Display.

        Compilation of the CIDL compiler source code requires the
Boost library, which is not included in this distribution of
ACE+TAO+CIAO. The Boost library is available at

http://www.boost.org

        Alternatively, a binary executable of the CIAO
CIDL compiler can be downloaded from

http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/CIAO/CIDL.html

Versions are available at the above site for Linux and Windows.
