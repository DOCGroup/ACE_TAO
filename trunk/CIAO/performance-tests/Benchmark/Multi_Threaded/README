      This black box experiment measures "multi-threading" support present in CIAO.
In this test, a client component spawns four threads that concurrently invoke operations
on the server. The latency, throughput and jitter for each thread is printed out. The
motivation of this test is to observe scalability when a ComponentServer receives
multiple requests from parallel clients. A sister test, ../Multi_Process documents
behavior as parallel clients (separate processes) invoke requests on the server.
