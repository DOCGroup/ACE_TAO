Mon Dec  11 20:55:39 UTC 2006  Gan Deng <gan.deng@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ciao/CCM_Event.idl:

          Modified the "ciao_push_event" operation to pass in "source_id",
          which is used to identify the sources of the publisher ports to
          support event filtering mechanism.

        * ciao/Deployment_Events.idl:

          Added new IDL definitions to support RTEC federation, such as
          AddrServer, UDPSender, UPDReceiver, etc.

        * ciao/Deployment_NodeApplication.idl:

          Modified the "install_es" operation to install one service object
          per invocation, instead of a sequence of objects.

        * DAnCE/NodeApplication/NodeApplication_Impl.cpp:
        * DAnCE/NodeApplication/NodeApplication_Impl.h:
        * DAnCE/DomainApplicationManager/DomainApplicationManager_Impl.cpp:
        * DAnCE/DomainApplicationManager/DomainApplicationManager_Impl.h:

          Modified to accomodate the changes made above by adding only
          one ciao event service object reference to the map.

        * ciaosvcs/Events/CIAO_Events_Base/CIAO_Events.idl:

          Removed the inheritance relationship between Consumer_Config and
          Supplier_Config object. The reason why it was there is because
          of a tightly coupled design long time ago.

        * ciaosvcs/Events/CIAO_Events_Base/CIAO_EventServiceBase.cpp:
        * ciaosvcs/Events/CIAO_Events_Base/CIAO_EventServiceBase.h:

          Added a virtual function "ciao_push_event" and provides a
          default implementation, which is essentially a no_op impl.

        * ciaosvcs/Events/CIAO_EventService_Factory_impl.cpp:
        * ciaosvcs/Events/CIAO_EventService_Factory_impl.h:

          Modified the factory method "create" by passing in the
          string identifier for the service object.

        * ciaosvcs/Events/CIAO_RTEC/CIAO_RTEvent.idl:

          Added new operations to create gateways object to support
          event channel federations.

          Added the implementation and MPC files to support event
          channel federations in CIAO_Event_Service.

        * CIDLC/ServantHeaderGenerator.cpp:
        * CIDLC/ServantSourceGenerator.cpp:

          Automatically generate the implementation code of
          ciao_push_event for component in the servant code.

        * DAnCE/NodeApplication/NodeApplication.cpp:

          Explicitly add the init_svcs() operation to the
          NA component server implementation. We should figure
          out a way to see whether we can avoid doing this at
          this level.

        * DAnCE/NodeManager/Node_Manager.cpp:

          Enhanced NM to pass in service configuration file explicitly.
          Also fixed a bug about controlling ORBDebugLevel.

        * docs/schema/CIAOEvents.xsd:

          Enhanced the CIAOEvents schema to support event channel
          federation configuration.

        * tools/Config_Handlers/CIAO_Events/CIAOEvents.hpp:
        * tools/Config_Handlers/CIAO_Events/CIAOEvents_Handler.cpp:

          schema changes.

Thu Dec  7 13:47:57 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * DAnCE/DomainApplicationManager/Deployment_Configuration (init):
          Use ACE_Read_Buffer to read the file and parse it contents. This way
          we are independent of a fixed buffer length, especially on systems
          with multiple network cards and IPv6 enabled the IORs can get huge.

          Don't build DnC server with minimum corba and CORBA/e, this was
          disabled in the past implicitly because we used security as
          MPC base project but because that has been removed we now
          have to explicitly disable this project

Wed Nov 29 21:26:53 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/generate_component_mpc.html:

          New file, documentation for the Perl script
          generate_component_mpc.pl, in CIAO_ROOT/bin.

        * bin/generate_component_mpc.pl:

          Changes mainly to correct problems with MPC files
          generated for non-component builds, i.e., from some IDL
          file used in common by multiple component builds, such
          as the definition of a port interface. Also made changes
          and added a new command line option to help minimize the
          amount of code generated from IDL and minimize the
          dependencies of the generated makefile or project.

        * DAnCE/NodeManager/CIAO_Monitor.cpp:
          Don't use plain new, fixes bugzilla bug 2732. Thanks to Abdul
          for reporting this

Wed Nov 29 12:48:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/*.idl:
          Added ciao/ as prefix to the include path. This way it is clear
          where we are including a file from.

Tue Nov 28 21:38:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * DAnCE/RTNodeApplication:
          Zapped, not used anymore

Tue Nov 28 19:33:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/Deployment_DomainApplicationManager.idl:
          Added comments about more details which are not compliant according
          to the spec

        * DAnCE/DomainApplicationManager/Deployment_Configuration.cpp:
          Use native bool instead of int

        * DAnCE/DomainApplicationManager/DomainApplicationManager_Impl.h:
          Reordered includes and improved doxygen documentation

        * DAnCE/NodeApplication/NodeApplication_Impl.cpp:
          Const changes, use ACE_ERROR for error messages

        * DAnCE/NodeManager/CIAO_Monitor.cpp:
          Const changes, use more ACE and little cleanup

        * DAnCE/NodeManager/CIAO_Monitor.h:

          Use the correct value for the lenght of the buffer passed
          to hostname

          Fixes for link errors in OS X.

Tue Nov 28 11:45:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * CIDLC/ExecutorMappingGenerator.cpp:
          Updated because of idl file rename

Tue Nov 28 10:42:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/*:
        * *:
          Renamed a lot of idl files, if the file contains interfaces/types
          from the DAnCE spec, added Deployment_ as prefix, if they are
          containing CIAO specific interfaces, added CIAO_. This way we can
          more easily see if we have spec compliant IDL or not.

Tue Nov 28 09:50:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/CCM_Home.idl:
        * ciao/CCM_Object.idl:
          Moved CCMHome again to its own file

        * ciao/Security.idl:
          CIAO uses an interface of the security service but we don't
          do a thing with it, so just define a local interface within
          CIAO and use that for the moment, saves 250Kb of footprint

        * ciao/CCM_Context.idl:
          Use the local security interface

        * ciao/ExectionManager.idl:
          Added todo

          LastConfiguration doesn't seem used, added a comment to that
          exception.

        * ciao/NodeApplicationManager.idl:
          Doxygen improvement

Mon Nov 27 13:23:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/NodeApplicationManager.idl:
          Doxygen improvement

        * DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager_Impl.cpp

          CIAO

        * DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager.mpc
          Removed the files above

        * DAnCE/NodeManager/NodeManager_Impl.cpp:
          Removed include of errno.h. It is not portable, but it seems
          it isn't needed at all. Thanks to Abdul for reporting this,
          this fixes bugzilla bug 2726.

Mon Nov 27 08:59:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          Added check whether we got a valid NodeImplementationInfo back
          and not a nill pointer. Fixes bugzilla bug 2692 finally.
          Thanks to Abdul for pointing out the need for this check

        * ciao/CCM_Home.idl:
        * ciao/CCM_Object.idl:
          Moved CCMHome again to its own file now the idl compiler has
          been fixed to handle this correctly

Wed Nov 22 20:39:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ciao/Dynamic_Component_Servant_Base.h:
          Removed the character c from the first line which drove the

        * ciao/CCM_Home.idl:
        * ciao/CCM_Object.idl:
          Moved CCMHome to CCMObject, when these are in seperate files
          the generated code for components is not correct. We want to have
          these interfaces in seperate files but we can sort out this
          later.

          Splitted the huge idl files into smaller parts. The CCM files are almost done,
          the Deployment files do need some more iterations to get smaller files that
          contain an interface with the types they need. This way the linker can optimize
          objects out during a static compilation
