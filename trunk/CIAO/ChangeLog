        * rules.ciao.GNU:
        * MPC/config/taoidl3toxmidefaults.mpb:
          Added a base project that will make it easier to use tao_idl3_to_xmi
          tool in MPC.

          tao_idl3_to_xmi has nothing to do with DAnCE. So corrected its MPC
          to output binary to $CIAO_ROOT/bin and renamed other things to make
          it part of CIAO.
