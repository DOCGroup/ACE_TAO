          Fixes for the DDS State connector. The semantics of this
          connector is that the state is kept in DDS, but the listeners
          where doing a take which removed the data from DDS. The basic
          and extended listener ports C++ templates are extended with a
          new template argument which is used to control the semantics
          of the listener, DDS4CCM_READ or DDS4CCM_TAKE. The State connector
          does use read, the Event connector does use take. This fixes
          bugzilla 4123

          Extended a few tests to check the state in DDS after they
          have received some samples through the listener. In previous
          versions this never returned data, with the updated DDS4CCM
          State connector semantics this now returns data
