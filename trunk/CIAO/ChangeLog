        * ciao/Containers/Container_Base_T.cpp:

        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/DDSCallbackStatusHandler.cpp:
        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/DataReaderHandler_T.cpp:
        * connectors/dds4ccm/impl/logger/Log_Macros.h:
          During shutdown it can happen that still event handlers are
          registered in the reactor and the DDS entities are already
          removed. At that moment we get BAD_INV_ORDER exceptions which
          is the only case we could get them, log them as warning
          messages at that moment instead of real errors
