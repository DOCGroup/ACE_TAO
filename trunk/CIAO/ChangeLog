          Catch everywhere C++ exceptions and log a CORBA::BAD_INV_ORDER
          at a lower priority, because that is a signal that the system
          is shutting down

          During shutdown it can happen that still event handlers are
          registered in the reactor and the DDS entities are already
          removed. At that moment we get BAD_INV_ORDER exceptions which
          is the only case we could get them, log them as warning
          messages at that moment instead of real errors
