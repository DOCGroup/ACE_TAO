<h1>Setting up a CIAO Android port</h1>

<p>Currently the CIAO Android port has been tested using Android NDKr8e running on an Android 4.1.2 platform (API level 16).</p>  

<p>The ACE test framework has been updated to be able to deploy CIAO regression tests in a mixed runtime environment. In this setup
the plan launcher, naming service and execution manager run on a Linux host platform. CIAO nodes can be configured to run either 
on the Linux host platform or an Android device.<p/>
<p>The tested configuration runs one node (with node manager, locality manager and component DLLs) on an Android device (a Beaglebone) and (the) other
node(s) on linux.</p>

<p>The tests currently refactored to be able to run in such a test setup are listed in CIAO/examples/ciao_android.lst.
For those tests minor changes are made in the run-test.pl scripts.</p>

<p>Below is a list of requirements needed to be able to set up an Android build and test environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>shared filesystem</b></font> - The Linux host platform and the android device need to share the Android cross-build tree using a shared 
  filesystem like NFS (this was used in the test described above); 
  It is required that the buildtree is mounted in such a way that the path to access the tree is identical for both platforms (Linux and Android)
  <li><b>XercesC</b> - Although not explicitly required for the parts of CIAO tested on the Android device, XercesC is required when testing a full cross 
  build of ACE/TAO/CIAO&DAnCE for Android. Since the multibyte support in the standard Android libraries is lacking it will be needed to port a
  multibyte support library like <code>libincov</code> as well. For the described cross build xerces2 and libiconv-1.13.1 were ported to 
  Android (see below for more information)
</ul>

<h2>Android shell executable path length limit</h2>
The Android shell executable path length in this setup shouldn't be longer then 128 bytes, consider this when mounting the buildtree. 

<h2>NFS mounting</h2>

Reliable NFS mounting required using TCP protocol.

<h2>Porting XercesC</h2>

Libiconv was ported according to the instructions <a href="http://danilogiulianelli.blogspot.nl/2012/12/how-to-cross-compile-libiconv-for.html">here</a>.
Subsequently cross building XercesC required 2 patches to circumvent a problem with the pthread library in the configure script and the lack of support for the <code>localeconv()</code> method.
