This is the README file for the Repository Manager (RM).

Building RM:
In order to be able to compile the RM you need to have ZZIP lib because the RM uses it to read the contents of 
CCM packages. ZZIP itself is a C++ wrapper around ZLIB, thus you will also need ZLIB. In order to compile the RM 
successfully you will need to do the following: 
1.Download ZLIB and ZZIP-LIB
2.Compile the multi-threaded versions of these libraries
3.[on Windows] Create a separate directory for each library; create an include and a lib subdirectory within them. 
Then copy the libraries files in the library subdirectory. Copy zlib.h in the zlib_path/include and copy zziplib.h, 
zzip-conf.h and zzip-msvc.h (for Windows platforms; Linux might have its own file!). This step might be easier if 
you find a binary package of the libraries and just install it.
4.Set $ZLIB_ROOT and $ZZIP_ROOT to point to the directories where you placed the libraries and the include files.
5.Turn on zzip and zlib in default.features for MPC.
6.MPC will handle the rest.

If you want to get the component package through http server:
1.Be sure to set JAWS_DOCUMENT_ROOT to the installation path of the RepoMan, i.e., $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager.
2.Start JAWS: $ACE_ROOT/apps/JAWS/server/main

Start RM:
1.Using ior file: 
  RepositoryManagerDaemon -o
2.Using Naming Service:
  RepositoryManagerDaemon -v [NameofRM]

Using RMadmin:
1.Install component package: (use BasicSP for example)
  Be sure you have BasicSP.cpk in the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/packages
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -i -l packages/BasicSP.cpk
  or
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -i -l http://127.0.0.1:5432/packages/BasicSP.cpk (If the JAWS is started)
  This will create the BasicSP directory, BasicSP.cpk file and BasicSP.epc file in the 
  $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager/
2.Delete component package: (use BasicSP for example)
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -d
3.Find component package by its name: (use BasicSP for example)
  > RMadmin -o -n BasicSP -f
4.Stop RM:
  > RMadmin -o -s
  This will create the RM_record file in the $CIAO_ROOT/DAnCE/RepositoryManager/RepositoryManager/ which record the 
  names and UUIDs of the installed component packages.
