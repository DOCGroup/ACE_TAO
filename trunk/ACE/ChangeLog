Sat Feb 10 23:13:06 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer.cpp (ace_yy_buffer_state): Disable VC8 warning
          C4351 (input_ elements will be default-initialized) for this
          block. The new behavior is good and desireable, so the warning
          noise can be silenced in this case.

Fri Feb  9 21:40:02 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.inl:
        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp:

          Removed ACE_WIN32 specific code in ACE_High_Res_Timer to reflect
          the change in the default value of ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION.
          Removed uses of ACE_HRTIME_CONVERSION and use
          ACE_Utils::Truncate instead.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:

          Changed the check for defining ACE_HRTIME_CONVERSION and
          ACE_HRTIME_TO_U64 from ACE_HRTIME_T_IS_BASIC_TYPE to
          ACE_LACKS_UNSIGNEDLONGLONG_T.

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp:

          Updated the test to use ACE_Utils::Truncate instead of
          static_cast which caused 0 to be output when time_t is 64-bit.

Fri Feb  9 12:19:57 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:

          Fixed a bug where the end of the ACE_THROW_SPEC would not be
          recognized.

Thu Feb  8 23:09:59 UTC 2007  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * examples/Logger/Acceptor-server/server_loggerd.cpp (handle_input):
        * examples/Logger/simple-server/Logging_Handler.cpp (handle_input):
        * examples/Logger/client/logging_app.cpp (ACE_TMAIN): Fixed these
          programs to use the proper (new) formatting for ACE_Log_Record.
          Thanks to Mouna Seri <seri at crhc dot uiuc dot edu> for
          reporting this.

Thu Feb  8 19:40:30 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Time_Request_Reply.{h cpp}:
        * netsvcs/lib/Makefile.am:
        * netsvcs/lib/lib.mpc:
        * netsvcs/lib/Time_Request_Reply.{h cpp}: Moved Time_Request_Reply
          from ace to netsvcs; it's only used from netsvcs and is only useful
          as an example of some ACE usage. Real time synch needs should be
          met using NTP.

        * ace/Name_Request_Reply.{h cpp}: Changed the sec_timeout_ transfer
          member from ACE_UINT32 to ACE_UINT64 to accomodate 64-bit time_t.

        * netsvcs/lib/TS_Clerk_Handler.h:
        * netsvcs/lib/TS_Server_Handler.h: Time_Request_Reply.h now is included
          from netsvcs/lib, not ace.

        * netsvcs/lib/Time_Request_Reply.{h cpp}: Changed the time-passing
          API arguments in the constructor and time() methods from ACE_UINT32
          to time_t. The on-wire protocol buffer fields that carry seconds
          values between clerk and server were changed from ACE_UINT32 to
          ACE_UINT64 to accomodate 64-bit time_t values.

        * NEWS: Explained the user-visible ramifications of these changes.

Thu Feb  8 09:23:50 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/MMAP_Memory_Pool.cpp:
          Removed empty else statement.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
          Fixed TCL/TK settings

Thu Feb  8 08:03:57 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
          Removed ACE_LACKS_CLEARERR and added ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_READDIR_R.

Wed Feb  7 23:04:49 UTC 2007  Wallace Zhang  <zhang_w@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Added two existing Notify Service examples into the autotest list.

Wed Feb  7 21:01:39 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Added a bit of info about building for National
          Instruments' LabVIEW RT which uses Pharlap ETS. In particular, if
          building for LabVIEW's Pharlap, add #define ACE_PHARLAP_LABVIEW_RT
          to your config.h file along with #include "ace/config-pharlap.h"
          to adjust for slight differences between stock Pharlap and
          LabVIEW RT's variant.

        * ace/config-pharlap.h: Pharlap doesn't supply InterlockedExchangeAdd
          and doesn't do SetFilePointerEx (needs ACE_LACKS_SETFILEPOINTEREX).

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (sched_params): Don't attempt SetPriorityClass
          on Pharlap - it's not defined.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (thr_getprio): For Pharlap ETS, use
          EtsGetTimeSlice() to determine the scheduling policy; if the time
          slice is anything other than 0, it's multitasking ACE_SCHED_OTHER.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (cuserid): Pharlap doesn't go GetUserName() so
          make it ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN.
          (adjust_flock_params): Use SetFilePointer() instead of
          SetFilePointerEx(), even with 64 bit offsets, if
          ACE_LACKS_SETFILEPOINTEREX is set.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (pwrite): For Windows platforms without
          overlapped I/O, don't rely on availability of SetFilePointerEx -
          platforms that have it also have overlapped I/O. In this case, use
          SetFilePointer with appropriate call differences for 32/64 bit
          file offsets.

        * ace/Pagefile_Memory_Pool.{h inl cpp}: Pharlap doesn't do this class.

        * ace/Configuration.{h cpp}:
        * ace/Registry.{h cpp}: The Windows registry is not available in
          Pharlap.

Wed Feb  7 14:44:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:

          Added the ability to remove the ACE_THROW_SPEC's completely.

Tue Feb  6 16:44:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
          For the moment expand ACE_THROW_SPEC to nothing, we want to deprecate
          this in TAO and want to see the impact of this on the tests

Tue Feb  6 15:36:00 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl: Remove the #if around #include "ace/Truncate.h"
          because ACE_Utils::Truncate is needed in a case that's not in a
          ACE_HAS_TIME_T_LONG_MISMATCH block.

Mon Feb  5 19:58:39 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp (operator>>): Use ACE_Utils::Truncate to truncate
          the received 64-bit time seconds to time_t.

Mon Feb  5 17:16:20 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h: Added a new setting for Windows VC8,
          ACE_HAS_TIME_T_LONG_MISMATCH, to capture the case that requires
          a replacement timeval def. See the following for details:
          Thu Feb  1 23:46:27 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          This change isolates just the desktop VC8 compiler for the change,
          avoiding compilers that don't need it and/or can't deal with
          the code.

        * ace/Time_Value.{h inl}: Change code that uses a replacement timeval
          from ACE_WIN32 to ACE_HAS_TIME_T_LONG_MISMATCH.

Fri Feb  2 14:45:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:
          Fixed compile error

Fri Feb  2 14:32:06 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Modified default behavior (if no -a, -o, -t, -C options are given)
          so that the script looks for TAO in $TAO_ROOT as well as
          $ACE_ROOT/TAO and similarly for CIAO.  This change supports the peer
          style layout.

Fri Feb  2 14:08:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:
          Also zap ACE_THROW_RETURN from application code, that is also
          deprecated now

Fri Feb  2 12:03:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Fixed merge error

Fri Feb  2 11:43:00 UTC 2007  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Supress 3.xx warnings about non-return from functions
          (Anoyingly it doesn't seem to think that a throw
          terminates the execution flow of a function.)

Fri Feb  2 10:47:55 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp:
          Layout change.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Enabled POSIX_SIG_PROACTOR and made some cleanups.

        * ace/os_include/net/os_if.h:
          Removed LynxOS specific include.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp:
          Enabled these tests again even if ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SIGEVENT_STRUCT
          is defined.

Fri Feb  2 10:31:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/CORBA_macros.h:
          Removed workaround for ACE_THROW_RETURN for HP aCC compiler. This is
          only needed for the HP 3.x compiler and we can suppress just this
          warning. When this has been build on the scoreboard we will
          zap the usage of this macro.

Fri Feb  2 06:56:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ACETAOCIAO.style:
          Configuration file for profactor (see www.profactor.co.uk), a
          code beautifier tool that we want to use to reformat the code
          in ACE/TAO/CIAO.

          ACE_LACKS_SIGVAL_T

Thu Feb  1 23:46:27 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * NEWS: Note change to ACE_Log_Record constructor.

        * ace/Log_Record.h (constructor): The "long time_stamp" argument was
          changed from long to time_t to correspond with what's expected.

        * ace/Log_Record.{h inl cpp}: The secs_ value was changed from
          ACE_UINT32 to time_t and is handled as a ACE_CDR::LongLong in the
          CDR insertion and extraction operators. The encode() and decode()
          methods are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
          ACE.

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp (priority_status): Cast sec() value to
          suseconds_t size to avoid truncation warnings.

        * ace/Time_Value.{h inl cpp}: Use a private struct to manage time
          internally for Windows since Windows' struct timeval uses long
          values internally instead of the standard time_t/suseconds_t
          that the class API uses (and POSIX uses in timeval). When a
          real OS-defined timeval is needed, build it on the fly for Windows.

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp: When logging ACE_Time_Value-obtained
          sec/usec values, truncate them down to u_int size. Avoids passing
          64-bit values to ACE_Log_Msg when only 32 bits will be taken from
          the arg vector for a %u format spec. Fixes crashing of this test
          on Win/VC8.

        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Monitor.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Monitor2.cpp: Treat time as an int
          instead of a time_t; makes the logic easier even though it'll break
          sometime in 2038.

        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/event_server.cpp: Unify use of time_t
          to hold time values from ACE_OS::time().

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP-inclient.cpp: When measuring messages
          per second, truncate seconds down to a 'long' to avoid truncation
          warnings at compile time from converting to double.

        * examples/Reactor/Misc/notification.cpp (svc): Initialize an
          ACE_Time_Value with secs / 2 instead of getting the seconds,
          multiplying into usecs, then dividing by 2. Avoids data truncation
          issues.

        * examples/Reactor/Multicast/Log_Wrapper.cpp (log_message): Cast
          result of time() to long to insert in the multicast buffer. Avoids
          truncation warning. Will stop recording a legit result sometime in
          2038 but the receiver isn't looking at the time field.

        * apps/gperf/src/Gen_Perf.cpp:
        * ASNMP/tests/test_config.h (randomize):
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Multithreading.cpp:
        * protocols/ace/RMCast/Link.cpp:

        * tests/Semaphore_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Thread_Mutex_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp: Cast time_t to u_int for use as an
          ACE_OS::srand() seed - we just want some bits, not to fit it back in
          range with ACE_Utils::Truncate.

Thu Feb  1 11:21:32 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp:
        * ace/Proactor.cpp:
        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

          Introduced a new feature test macro ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SIGEVENT_STRUCT
          to make POSIX_CB_Proactor compile on FreeBSD 7.0-CURRENT.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp:

          Modified due to changes above.

Thu Feb  1 08:05:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Fixed compile errors in the NT Message Queue when build without
          threading under windows

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
          Layout changes

Wed Jan 31 23:06:42 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h:

          Replaced ACE_LACKS_CUSERID with ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID to get the ACE
          library to provide us with a cuserid() function.

        * ASNMP/asnmp/asn1.cpp:
        * apps/drwho/global.h:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/C-inclient.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/C-inserver.cpp:

        * examples/Reactor/Multicast/Log_Wrapper.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Multicast/server.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Name_Handler.cpp:

          Replaced htonl, htons, ntohl, and ntohs with the appropriate
          ACE_XTOYZ macro (ACE_HTONL, for example).  QNX doesn't have htonl and
          friends without adding extra #includes.

Wed Jan 31 19:03:37 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Added constants ACE_FLT_MIN and ACE_DBL_MIN to provide consistency
          with ACE_FLT_MAX AND ACE_DBL_MAX.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:
        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp:

          Enhanced the ACE_CDR::LongDouble class which is used on platforms
          where the native long double is not 16 bytes.

          Provided operators to support multiplication, division, addition
          and subtraction as well as conversion to the native long double.

          An assign() method is also provided to set the value of the
          ACE_CDR::LongDouble.  Since this class will be stored in a union
          (if used as an IDL type), it can not have a non-trivial constructor
          or assignment operator.  The existing
          ACE_CDR_LONG_DOUBLE_INITIALIZER macro is used to initialize the
          LongDouble and a new macro, ACE_CDR_LONG_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT, is
          used to assign to the LongDouble in a portable fashion.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added the new TAO LongDouble test.

Wed Jan 31 17:30:46 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: If stdcpplib=0 is
          selected at build time, explicitly set -AP compile option to use
          old C++ libraries and no std namespace. Also set
          ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS when -AP is set - there is a numeric_limits
          but not in std. Note that ACE_Array_Map won't build with stdcpplib=0
          but pre-ACE-5.5 legacy code will still build.

          Also removed the HP-UX 10.x remnants and pre-3.0 aC++ support
          from platform_hpux_aCC.GNU. Could probably safely remove more old
          compiler support (anything older than 3.56 probably) but I played
          it a little conservative for now.

Wed Jan 31 17:22:11 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * protocols/examples/examples.mwc:

          Removed the implicit usage.  It is not necessary since each
          example has a .mpc file.

        * protocols/examples/example_base.mpb:

          Removed this file.  It was not needed.

Wed Jan 31 16:55:23 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h:

          Removed #define ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS as it seems to be both rarely
          used (only oddball platforms like unixware and other QNX versions
          have it) and also incompatible with inline=0 builds.
          Also added new config macros ACE_LACKS_STRPTIME (June 2006) and
          ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_READDIR_R (December 2006).
          These modifications have been tested with QNX 6.3 but from the docs
          on the QNX web site I believe they apply to QNX 6.2 as well.

Wed Jan 31 15:44:54 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp:
          Use sigval (which is SUS defined) instead of sigval_t. If this
          change doesn't break on any platform I'll remove unnecessary
          typedef and related stuff.

Wed Jan 31 13:31:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Removed obsolete checks for environment macros

        * ace/Recycable.h:
          Removed empty brief doxygen tag

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Renamed ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SZ_PAGESIZE to ACE_HAS_NOTSUP_SC_PAGESIZE

Wed Jan 31 13:21:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Added improvement for GCC on HPUX IA64

Wed Jan 31 10:17:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Improved support for GCC on HPUX IA64

Wed Jan 31 07:50:44 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (ACE_OS::sched_params):  Check if the
          ACE_id_t id that is being passed in is equal to ACE_SELF.  If
          so, pass ::GetCurrentProcessId() to ::OpenProcess() instead of
          id.  ACE_SELF is defined to be 0 on ACE_WIN32; process id 0 is
          the zero-page process, and we certainly don't want to attempt to
          set it to REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS :-)

Wed Jan 31 03:25:51 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.h:

          Removed the special case default definition of
          ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION to ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_MSECS on Windows;
          added a #ifndef around the default definition in case the user
          wishes to change it.  This was done to prevent useless values
          like 0 showing up in calculations using ACE_Basic_Stats when the
          time intervals are of the order of a few microseconds.  Most of
          the current machines have a QueryPerformanceCounter()
          implementation that returns a value of atleast 3 MHz.  So it
          should be completely safe to use the definition of
          ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_USECS as the default value for
          ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION on contemporary x86 machines running
          Windows.

        * ace/Message_Block.inl:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          Moved the definition of
          ACE_Dynamic_Message_Strategy::priority_status() from
          Message_Block.inl to Message_Block.cpp.  It was a big function
          and it currently has code that causes a warning with VC8 on
          Windows.

Tue Jan 30 19:21:50 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Module.h:

          Removed the trailing comma from the last element of the enum.

Tue Jan 30 16:26:43 UTC 2007  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/sets-manager.py:

          Modified to pin the version of MPC at the time of branching/tagging
          under modules/ACE/MPC.  Note:  This does not branch OR tag MPC,
          it simply causes the branch/tag to check out a specific
          revision of MPC.

Tue Jan 30 13:51:32 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Module.h:
        * ace/Module.cpp:

          There was no way to distinguish between flags not being set and
          flags to indicate that tasks should not be deleted.  I have
          changed the M_DELETE_NONE enum value to 4 and added a new enum
          value for use in flag initialization.  With this change, the
          close() method can determine if it needs to use the flags passed
          in or the internal flags.  This fixes Bugzilla #2497.

Tue Jan 30 11:35:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Countdown_Time.{h,cpp}:
          Readded destructor, missed that it updates the max_wait_time
          passed to the constructor

Tue Jan 30 10:44:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          When pipes is set to 1, also add -pipe to the CCFLAGS

        * include/makeinclude/platform_rtems.x_g++.GNU:
          Set pipes to 1, set DCCFLAGS

Tue Jan 30 10:14:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Unbounded_Set.cpp:
          Initialise pointer with 0.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (getpagesize):
        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          RTEMS does define _SC_PAGESIZE, but using sysconf with _SC_PAGESIZE
          results in -1. Added a new define ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SC_PAGESIZE to be
          able to disable the usage of sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE) for rtems 4.6,
          the ::getpagesize() function returns a correct value.

Tue Jan 30 09:46:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Added a test for ACE_OS::getpagesize(), it should return a value
          bigger then 0 else the memory pools don't work

Tue Jan 30 00:25:00 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: If the user sets RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE to
          keep a lot of the standard C++ library out of the std namespace,
          avoid setting ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB, and also
          hoist everything else from std into the global namespace. This is
          necessary because RW wasn't consistent with using their internal
          _RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE and the user-settable RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE and
          some things end up in std and some not; so get the ones that ended
          up in std out to global with the rest of them.

          Layout changes, result of experimenting with a code
          beautifier

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Improved rtems port, added support for building with
          threads=0

        * ace/config-sco-5.0.0.h:
          Removed commented out define

        * ace/config-vxworks6.4.h:
          putenv fails with VxWorks 6.4 with a pentium target

        * ace/Countdown_Time.{h,cpp}:
          Use bool, removed return value from most methods, it was
          meaningless, removed destructor, not needed to update members
          in a destructor

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
          Export Token_Guard, fixes bugzilla 2786, thanks to
          <sailzeng at tencent dot com> for reporting this

        * OS_NS_pwd.inl (getpwnam_r):
          Initialize pointer with 0, simplified this a little

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html:
          Updated example with doxygen style of documentation

Sun Jan 28 19:59:14 2007  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

Thu Jan 25 19:59:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          The include of rules.cia.GNU must come before the include of
          rules.tao.GNU in order for CIAO libraries to have the correct
          version numbers.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          Fixed the -l option to use the correct variable name and corrected
          a bug where the script changed to the wrong directory if the -l
          option was used.

        * bin/clean_sems.sh:

          Support the ngvipc command to clean up semaphores on MacOS X.

        * ace/OS_NS_string.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Replaced ACE_HAS_MEMCHR with ACE_LACKS_MEMCHR, this way a platform that
          lacks this method has to set an explicit define, maybe it now shows
          that all platforms have this method and we don't need an emulation
          anymore. Also removed several emulations that are not needed anymore

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Layout changes

        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.{h,cpp}:
