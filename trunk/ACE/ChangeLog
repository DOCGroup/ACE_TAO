        * ace/Time_Value.inl:
        * ace/Time_Value.h:

          Add extra inline void msec(int) that calls void msec(long)
          to avoid amiguity between void msec(long) and void msec(_int64 &)
          when natual sized integers are given (which seems to be
          quite often).

Wed Jun 11 13:02:22 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:

          Replaced the "use PerlACE::Process".  It is necessary to be loaded
          inside this module to ensure that all of the command line options
          can be processed.

Tue Jun 10 21:28:23 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/platform.m4:

          Add ACE_CHECK_GETNAME_RETURNS_RANDOM_SIN_ZERO feature check,
          which sets the ACE_GETNAME_RETURNS_RANDOM_SIN_ZERO feature test
          macro on Linux systems running kernels older than 2.5.47.  This
          is a compile time check, like was done in config-linux-common.h,
          based on the value of LINUX_VERSION_CODE from <linux/version.h>.
          This means ACE compiled on a newer Linux system but deployed on
          an older one could result in run-time failures.

          Fixes Bugzilla #3132.

Tue Jun 10 21:33:25 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h:
        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:

          Replaced a Monitor class forward declaration with the full file
          include, moved from the source file to the header file. This
          move enables ACE monitor points to compile when inlining is
          turned on.

Tue Jun 10 18:46:24 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Stack_Trace.h:

          Updated comments to not exclude Borland from supported platforms.

        * ace/Stack_Trace.cpp:

          - Moved the label "x" from inside of asm to be outside. Some compiler
            does not like it.
          - Enabled LynOS support and excluded support for gcc old versions before 3.3.

Tue Jun 10 13:56:17 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Stack_Trace.cpp:

          One more fix for Win32 wchar.

Tue Jun 10 13:32:57 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:

          Avoid pointer-to-function and pointer-to-object warnings from g++.

Tue Jun 10 12:53:05 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp:

          Added a static cast to avoid warnings on QNX.

Tue Jun 10 10:57:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at prismtech dot com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Correct presidence bug highlighted by FC9_GCC_430 build:
          ACE.cpp:1429: warning: suggest parentheses around && within ||
          ACE.cpp:1665: warning: suggest parentheses around && within ||
          ACE.cpp:1853: warning: suggest parentheses around && within ||
          The default precidence is && before ||, but the way the ||
          statements were grouped, it was clear that was not the intended
          resolution.

          Correct empty if statement bug highlighted by FC9_GCC_430 build:
          ACE.cpp:2773: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement

          Also removed warnings by using empty braces:
          ACE.cpp:3389: warning: suggest a space before ';' or explicit braces around empty body in 'while' statement
          ACE.cpp:3414: warning: suggest a space before ';' or explicit braces around empty body in 'while' statement


Mon Jun  9 21:38:04 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Stack_Trace.cpp:

          Passed string literals instead of ACE_TEXT string to GetProcAddress as it
          accepts LPCSTR which is defined as char*. This should fix wchar (Win32)
          build errors.

Mon Jun  9 20:52:52  2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Asynch_IO.h: Doxygen improvements.

          Excluded LynxOS, MinGW and Borland builds from stack trace supported
          platforms.

Mon Jun 09 14:46:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at prismtech dot com>

        * ace/Stack_Trace.cpp:
        * ace/Stack_Trace.h:

          Remove TEXT() and TCHAR Fuzz errors.

Mon Jun  9 11:26:36 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:

          Added Stack_Trace.cpp since Log_Msg.cpp needs it.

Mon Jun 09 10:42:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at prismtech dot com>

        * ace/NT_Service.cpp:

          unambiguated call to time_value msec(long) at line 437

Sun Jun  8 18:09:22 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * m4/platform.m4:

          Add ACE_CHECK_HAS_DLSYM_SEGFAULT_ON_INVALID_HANDLE feature
          check, which sets the ACE_HAS_DLSYM_SEGFAULT_ON_INVALID_HANDLE
          feature test macro on Linux and OpenBSD systems (as is done in
          the canned config-*.h files).  Fixes Bugzilla #3141.

Sat Jun  7 13:56:56 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Use ACE_TEXT instead of ACE_LIB_TEXT.

Sat Jun  7 03:28:01 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Merged in stack_trace_branch that added stack trace support.

        * NEWS:

          Add an entry for stack trace support.

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:

          Added comments for "%?".

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Added new conversion character, the question mark, which gets
          replaced by a stack trace on supported platforms.

        * ace/Stack_Trace.h:
        * ace/Stack_Trace.cpp:

          Added new class that, on supported platforms, will take a
          snapshot of the current stack when instantiated.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Added Stack_Trace in as source.

        * ace/config-macosx-leopard.h:

          Added ACE_HAS_EXECINFO_H define.

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Added Stack_Trace.h and Stack_Trace.cpp.

        * configure.ac:

          Added checks for execinfo.h header.

        * tests/Stack_Trace_Test.cpp:

          New test.

        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Added Stack_Trace_Test in.

Fri Jun  6 19:05:14 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Win32.pm:

          Put an eval around the require of Net::Telnet so that these
          modules can always be "used", but not necessarily employed.

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:

          Use PerlACE::TargetProcess and PerlACE::HostProcess so that all
          test scripts may use them.

        * bin/PerlACE/TargetProcess.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/HostProcess.pm:

          Added modules to simplify the writing of test scripts so that
          VxWorks testing can be transparent to the script itself.  Having
          two packages allows for role reversal (using the -reverse_roles
          option to run_test.pl).  For example, if you have a test that
          consists of a server and a client, the script will look like this:

            $SV = new PerlACE::TargetProcess("server", "-o $iorfile");
            $CL = new PerlACE::HostProcess("client", "-k file://$iorfile");

          If testing for VxWorks, the server process will be run on the
          target and the client process will be run on the host.  If the
          -reverse_roles option is provided to run_test.pl, the server
          process will run on the host and the client process will run on
          the target.

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          untabified.

Fri Jun 06 11:10:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at prismtech dot com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Added #include ace/OS_NS_fcntl.h to previous commit of
          Thu Jun  5 23:46:14 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin.

Fri Jun  6 08:31:06 UTC 2008  Vladimir Zykov  <vzykov@prismtech.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          According to Steve Huston HP-UX does provide strtoull and
          wcstoull but they can be used not as straight forward as
          in other compilers. I have no access to HP-UX so I added
          corresponding TODO comment about ACE_LACKS_STRTOULL and
          ACE_LACKS_WCSTOULL that I added previously.

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.4.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.3.h:
          VxWorks doesn't provide wcstoull as well.
          Added ACE_LACKS_WCSTOULL.

Thu Jun  5 23:46:14 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp:

          Changed daemonize() to open /dev/null and duplicate the file
          descriptor as descriptors 0, 1, and 2 if it is invoked with the
          closed_all_handles flag set.  This avoids problems with I/O
          to/from stdin, stdout, and stderr; cin, cout, and cerr;
          etc. being written to/read from whatever files/sockets/devices
          associated with descriptors 0, 1, and 2 when they are reopened.
          This fixes Bugzilla #3338.

Thu Jun  5 16:30:58  2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * NEWS: Added note concerning ACE_Time_Value changes from

Tue Jun  3 13:09:27 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_main.h (wmain): Added

          ACE_BEGIN_VERSIONED_NAMESPACE_DECL
          ACE_END_VERSIONED_NAMESPACE_DECL

          to the ace_wmain_i macro.  Thanks to June Fang <june dot fang at
          gmail dot com> for reporting this.

Thu Jun  5 14:52:43 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.{h inl}: Added a non-const variant of
          void msec(ACE_UINT64&) - this allows the msec(ACE_UINT64&) accessor
          to be called on both const and non-const objects without error.
          Fixes Bugzilla #3336. Thanks to Simon Massey for this idea.

        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp: Added a const-checking msec() call and
          corrected the test case.

Thu Jun 05 13:45:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:
        * ace/Get_Opt.h:
        * ace/Get_Opt.inl:

          As a conveniance in wide character builds allow the
          options string to be specified as a standard narrow
          string (that is converted internally). This type of
          use is littered throughout the TAO code.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:

          As a conveniance in wide character builds allow the
          fopen() call to have parameters of mixed wide/narrow
          type. This type of use is littered throughout the TAO
          code.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl:

          Correct the mkstemp facades, they were not returning
          the modified template string under wide character builds,
          this caused the tao_idl compiler to be unable to find
          the pre-processed files to rename that it had just created.

        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_MFC.mpc:
        * examples/Log_Msg/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Msg_Unicode_MFC.mpc:

          Deleted the Unicode specific version, normal one suffices
          after all.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Disabled problematic LynxOS test.

Wed Jun  4 22:45:20  2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-pharlap.h: Added ACE_LACKS_FILELLOCKS. My changes from
          Mon Apr 28 21:53:23 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          exposed a call to LockFileEx, which is not present on Pharlap
          (and, therefore, not present in LabVIEW RT). The alternate API,
          LockFile, is present on Pharlap but documented as unsupported.
          Since the OS doesn't do multiple processes, there are more effective
          ways to synchronize that file locks anyway.

Wed Jun  4 20:59:16 UTC 2008  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp:
          Fix for Bug 3337. ::SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack() isn't
          ready for Windows.

Wed Jun  4 17:12:10 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ACE.cpp (timestamp):

          Make sure to divide sizeof timebuf by sizeof (ACE_TCHAR) to
          avoid buffer overflow. This is another instance of the same
          problem fixed in:

        * ace/Monitor_Point_Registry.cpp:
        * ace/Monitor_Base.cpp:

          Disabled warning messages reporting an unsuccessful unbind
          of a monitor from the monitor point registry. In some
          cases, it appears that the default process reactor singleton
          is destroyed before the monitor point registry. The reactor
          has an associated ACE_Message_Queue, which in turn has an
          associated monitor. Somehow in the destruction of the
          singleton, the normal chain of destructor calls, which
          would remove the monitor from the registry, is bypassed,
          leaving the removal to happen when the registry's
          destructor is called and the entry in question is no longer
          valid. In any case, this happens only at process shutdown,
          and there is no memory leak. Ways to make this happen in
          a more friendly fashion are being looked into.

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/INET_Addr.h:

          Changed ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_addr(char *, int) to be thread
          safe by calling ACE_OS::inet_ntop() instead of
          ACE_OS::inet_ntoa().

          Changed ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_addr(void) to call
          INET_Addr::get_host_addr(char *, size) with a static buffer.

          Removed the special cases for VxWorks in both of the above
          methods which called inet_ntoa_b() which, according to comments,
          was for efficency and thread safety.  These are are now as
          efficent and thread safe (or not, in the case of ACE_INET_Addr::
          get_host_addr(void)) as any other target platform, but no longer
          need a string buffer member in every ACE_INET_Addr instance.

        * ace/Monitor_Base.h (clear):

          Made the method virtual, since it's overridden in the

          Added the stringified process id to the construction of

Thu May 15 12:36:42 UTC 2008  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/MMAP_Memory_Pool.cpp:
          When using a default base address of 0x0 and otherwise wanting
          a fixed address, a special flag was used to imply that after the
          first address is selected the system in a call to ::mmap()
          subsequent calls to ::mmap() reuse the selected base address
          as a fixed address. This may cause problems with reloading
          persistent data if the stored data contains pointers and the
          system selected base address changes from run to run.

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
          The default base address for the x86-64 platform cannot be 0x0.
          Doing so causes the system to choose an address which for some
          unknown reason causes SEGV errors in Malloc_T. The linux-specific
          mmap flag, MAP_32BIT, resolves those segv errors, but on x86-64
          using 0x0 as the default base address on subsequent runs cause
          a different assigned base address to be selected. If the data
          in the mapped memory contains pointers to mapped memory, those
          are then wrong and cause SEGV crashs. By experimentation, it
          seems the default base address for powerpc is appropriate for
          x86-64.

          Added ACE_HAS_MONITOR_POINTS which currently is set to 0. We will

        * ace/Unbounded_Set_Ex.cpp:

          Extended the Unbounded_Set to include a comparator template parameter,
          which must implement operator (), which returns true if the items are
          equivalent.  This class has been renamed Unbounded_Set_Ex.

          Unbounded_Set is now implemented in terms of Unbounded_Set_Ex with a
          comparator that uses operator== to compare the items.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:

          Slight updates to conform with new implementation.

          Doxygen improvements and moved the documentation about the
          handle_signal method from the cpp to the header file so that
          it appears in the doxygen documentation

        * ace/MonitorControl/MonitorControl.mpc:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_mc.mpb:
          Avoid wince - it lacks the needed PDH capability.

Thu May  1 18:27:10 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/MonitorControl/MonitorControl.mpc:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_mc.mpb:
          Use ACE_MonitorControl as shared library name

Thu May  1 17:31:01 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp: Removed an assert guarding the case when
        the current thread has no associated configuration context. Added
        code that would initialize the thread's configuration context with
        the global, instead. This addresses bug# 3315.

Thu May  1 17:11:48 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/ace.mwc:

          Added MonitorControl directory to the workspace.

Thu May  1 17:05:37 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

          Changed header includes to be consistently relative
          to $ACE_ROOT.

Thu May  1 16:11:12 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * MonitorControl/*:

          Moved this directory to $ACE_ROOT/ace.

Thu May  1 15:56:58 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Change Bug_2980_Regression_Test's !MSVC to
          !Win32. The test won't run on Windows per its comments, but no
          XML configs set MSVC - they set Win32.

Thu May  1 15:27:25 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp: In the counting test, run multiples
          of 50,000 instead of 100,000, blocks. The test is timing out on a
          number of platforms.

        * tests/RW_Process_Mutex_Test.cpp: Fix signed/unsigned warnings and
          wchar build error. Changed the default lock name to something other
          than the program's name. Using the program name produces "text
          file busy" when attempting a file lock on it... doh...

Thu May  1 14:47:33 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * MonitorControl/examples/*:

          Removed this directory and moved its contents to
          $ACE_ROOT/examples/Monitor.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/acelib.mpb:

          Cosmetic changes.

Thu May  1 14:37:03 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VXTestProjectCreator.pm:

          Override the warn_useless_project() method so that we are no
          longer warned about "no useful targets" for this project type.

Wed Apr 30 22:01:10 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/RW_Process_Mutex_Test.cpp: New test for proper functioning
          of ACE_RW_Process_Mutex.

        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/run_test.lst: Add RW_Process_Mutex_Test.

Wed Apr 30 21:14:45 UTC 2008  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h:

          Two of the backwards compatible iterators for
          ACE_Hash_Map_Manager incorrectly defined the iterator_category
          trait based on the container_type, which does not have an
          iterator_category. Now the trait is defined in terms of its
          base class. This resolved Bugzilla Bug #3314.

Wed Apr 30 16:49:27 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * MonitorControl/PacketsSentMonitor.h:
        * MonitorControl/BytesReceivedMonitor.h:
        * MonitorControl/PacketsReceivedMonitor.h:
        * MonitorControl/BytesSentMonitor.h:

          Added include of export header file, since it's not
          pulled in indirectly on Solaris builds.

        * MonitorControl/WindowsMultiInstanceMonitor.cpp:

          Fixed signed/unsigned comparison warnings on wchar builds.

Wed Apr 30 13:49:52 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp (get_timestamp_and_clocksequence): Case clock sequence
          value using ACE_UINT16 instead of u_char to prevent duplicates
          when many UUIDs are generated quickly. Thanks to Wim van den Boogaard
          for this fix. Resolves Bugzilla #3313.

Tue Apr 29 19:52:48 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp: Simplify the timer_handler_ task spawn and
          shutdown. Also, if close() sees an error from the implementation's
          close, don't stop closing. Things are most likely already ripped
          apart too far to recover from, and it's likely to cause a hang to
          just try to stop closing now.

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp: Correctly handle the ACE_Message_Block
          pointers passed to operations and later updating when complete.
          Thanks to Fernando C. Jeronymo <fernando dot fcavalcanti at
          gmail.com> for diagnosing this problem.

        * THANKS: Added Fernando C. Jeronymo to the Hall of Fame.

        * tests/Proactor_UDP_Test.cpp: Fix to close down correctly in
          half-duplex mode.

Tue Apr 29 19:12:53 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_etcl_parser.mpb:

          Changed the path of the 'includes' line to match
          the new location of ETCL.

        * MonitorControl/Constraint_Interpreter.cpp:
        * MonitorControl/Constraint_Visitor.h:
        * MonitorControl/Constraint_Visitor.cpp:
        * MonitorControl/Constraint_Interpreter.h:

          Updated #includes to match the new location of ETCL.

        * MonitorControl/AutoUpdateStarter.h:

          Moved location of enabled monitors check, it was
          previous to any place it could see the #define in
          an included file.

        * MonitorControl/examples/Constraint/constraint.cpp:
        * MonitorControl/examples/CPU_Load/cpu_load.cpp:

          Updated Beta to Micro

Tue Apr 29 18:02:22 UTC 2008  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ETCL/*:

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl: Removed all the pre-ACE_HAS_WINNT4 code in the
          file locks methods. This was the only place left in ACE that
          referred to ACE_HAS_WINNT4; all pre-NT4 support was removed last
          year from the rest of ACE. This also corrects behavior of file
          locks as well as ACE_RW_Process_Mutex.

        * ace/RW_Process_Mutex.h: Doxygen improvements.

        * ace/SOCK_CODgram.h: Doxygen improvements.

        * ace/SOCK_CODgram.cpp (open): If either of the local or remote
          addresses is specified, use its address family rather than the
          value of protocol_family. If both are specified, they must match.

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp: Added a counting test to validate the
          queue's message counting.

        * tests/Proactor_UDP_Test.cpp: New test for UDP with ACE_Proactor.

        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/run_test.lst: Add Proactor_UDP_Test.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vxtest.mpd:
        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Unix.pm:

          Began integration of the foo.vxtest files into the actual testing
          process.  This needs to get enhanced in ProcessVX_Win32.pm too.

Fri Apr 25 21:21:56 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:

          Removed a comment that no longer applies.

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:

          Changed the check for failure to spawn a process, in order to avoid
          a race condition (the spawned process exits normally before we even
          check its status).

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          With -s, account for different parameter formatting requirements in
          the win32 and posix sandbox programs.

Fri Apr 25 14:25:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at pristmech dot com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          I've backed out this change due to lack of time to chase up
          the lack of macro definitions. This will need to be revisited.

Fri Apr 25 10:40:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at pristmech dot com>

        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:
          This test wasn't using ACE_TMAIN.

Fri Apr 25 09:10:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at pristmech dot com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
        * examples/Log_Mgs/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Mgs_MFC.mpc:
          Feature name "uses_wchar" already used within ACE/TAO. Replaces
          the "unicode" feature name. Template / project names within MPC
          still named unicode.

Thu Apr 24 18:45:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
          When ACE_LACKS_STROPTS_H not is defined we assume we have
          strbut so we set ACE_HAS_STRBUF_T

Thu Apr 24 16:47:16 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          The DLL_ORB test requires threads.  Disable it when the ST config
          is used.

Thu Apr 24 15:05:50 UTC 2008  Simon McQueen  <sm@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Scheduled new regression test for bug #3299.

Thu Apr 24 09:55:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at pristmech dot com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_unicode.mpb:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          Default unicode=0 feature. Unicode does not depend upon MFC,
          may be used together as necessary.

        * examples/Log_Mgs/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Mgs_MFC.mpc:
        * examples/Log_Mgs/Log_Msg_MFC/Log_Mgs_Unicode_MFC.mpc:
          Split out the unicode requirements.

Thu Apr 24 05:58:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Refcountable_T.{cpp,inl}:
          Use ACE_INLINE

Thu Apr 24 05:47:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-posix.h:
          Reverted change below, already made a similar change which is less risky

        Thu Apr 17 19:27:23 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>
        * ace/config-posix.h: Added a check for

        #if defined _XOPEN_STREAMS && _XOPEN_STREAMS == -1
        # define ACE_LACKS_STROPTS_H
        #endif

        so that ACE will compile properly on Fedora 8.  Thanks to
        Jules Colding <colding at 42tools dot com> for this fix.

Wed Apr 23 18:29:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Refcountable.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * ace/Refcountable_T.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Changed ACE_Refcountable to ACE_Refcountable_T which has a
          trait for the type of lock. ACE_Refcountable is now a typedef
          of ACE_Refcountable_T<ACE_Null_Mutex>. Also the refcount
          type is now a long so that we can make use of the Atomic_Op
          optimizations on some platforms

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Updated for the change above

Wed Apr 23 14:49:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
          When _XOPEN_STREAMS is defined to -1 we don't have stropts.h,
          this fixes bugzilla 3291. Thanks to Jules Colding
          <colding at 42tools dot com> for reporting this

Wed Apr 23 14:10:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/ACE-development-process.html:
          We are using svn as repository

Wed Apr 23 14:01:32 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/generate_rel_manpages:
          Corrected doxygen path

        * bin/group_test_stats.sh:
          Helper script to analyze test stat diffs

        * ace/Sig_Handler.{h,cpp}:
          Doxygen changes and changed third_party_sig_handler flag to a
          bool

        * ace/Service_Repository.{h,cpp}:
          Changed ignore_suspended to a bool

        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.h:
          Fixed typo in comment

        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.3.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.4.h:
          Removed workaround that is only needed with VxWorks 5.5.1

        * ace/Codeset_Registry_db.cpp:
          Added UCS2 and correct short names. This fixes bugzilla 3295

        * ace/Codeset_IBM1047.h:
          Doxygen changes

        * ace/Cleanup_Strategies_T.h:
          Layout changes

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.{h,inl}:
          No need for virtual methods, use bool and doxygen changes

        * ace/Service_Manager.h:
          Explicitly mark destructor as virtual

        * ace/Service_Object.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Use bool

Wed Apr 23 01:53:32 CDT 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE version 5.6.4 released.

Wed Apr 16 13:06:05 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/ARGV.cpp:
          Don't quote quotes already quoted.

Mon Apr 14 12:10:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/run_test.pl:
          Don't run 2980 when WCHAR is set

Mon Apr 14 11:08:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Threading_Helper_T.cpp:
          Removed

        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Removed file above

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Changed the template instantiations like we have for Atomic_Op.

Mon Apr 14 09:54:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Don't build 2980 with wchar enabled and added empty resource
          file section

Mon Apr 14 08:59:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Threading_Helper_T.cpp:
          Added new file with the threading helper template code. This resolves
          the strange link problems with BCB. This file is included in the
          Service_Config.h file

        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added new files

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Include the new Threading_Helper_T.cpp and removed the implementation
          from these files

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Added missing include for bug 2980

        * ace/Codeset_Registry.h:
          Fixed typo in comment

        * ace/Shared_Object.h:
          Doxygen changes

Mon Apr 14 01:56:06 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.inl:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Moved ACE_Threading_Helper ctor and dtor implementaion
          inline. This makes them available to code that indirectly
          references the threadkey_ member (like, in examples/). This
          should resolve link-time problems with borland compilers.

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp (unloadDll):

          Fixing warnings about missing extern "C" qualifier in call to
          pthread_create.

Sun Apr 13 07:27:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (_vx_call_entry):
          Set the sc::current before calling main. This resolves the
          sc asserts with vxworks kernel mode. Thanks to Iliyan
          for suggesting this addition

Fri Apr 11 17:36:34 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/Download.html:
        * docs/ACE-development-process.html:
        * docs/ACE-bug-process.html: Updated these files to use the major,
          minor, and micro release terminology.

Fri Apr 11 15:26:08 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Including config-lite.h: the driver is non-ACE but it still
          needs to know platform-specific stuff, like threads usage,
          etc.

Fri Apr 11 01:51:13 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Fixing a fuzz build warning of a missing $Id. Also, not all
          make(1)'s have $(MV), so changing mpb to use just "mv"

Thu Apr 10 22:32:58 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fixing compile problems with single-thread-only builds - using
          the compiler's abilities (partial specialization) to generate
          appropriate code.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Token_Table.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Changes to fix compile problems related to versioned namespace
          use. Eliminated custom token file post-processing - replaced
          with a wrapper header file (yacc(1) is now producing
          Token_Table.h, which gets included in Tokens.h)

Thu Apr 10 14:42:04 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:

          Adding YYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED to prevent yacc(1) from trying to use a
          trivial definition of YYSTYPE.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:

          Fixing an unused variable warning. Adding an YYSTYPE guard.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Undefining YYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED at the bottom of Svc_Conf_Tokens.h
          prevents it from leaking and poluting the global namespace. This
          allows other yacc(1) based parsers to be used in ACE
          apps. Cleaning up and recording generated files.

Thu Apr 10 13:27:13 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:

           Fixed compilation issues and reversed the CAN_RUN_TEST check to
           get it to run on non-win32 and non-vxworks operating systems.

Thu Apr 10 10:11:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dynamic_Service.inl:

          Added missing versioned namespace macros

Thu Apr 10 06:41:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:
          Added include of Guard_T.h

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_pgi.GNU:
          Updated for latest pgCC version

Thu Apr 10 00:50:53 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Fixing a compile problem with no-threads builds.

Wed Apr  9 22:05:30 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Simplified the build sequence reducing the number of additional
          transformations needed for Bison's parser output. That includes
          the elimination of the ACE_YY prefix, which was necessary only
          because of these transformations.  Added ACE_TEXT around naked
          string literals. Fixed build warnings with unicode builds.

Wed Apr  9 20:22:46 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:
          Fixing relocate_i to both account for empty slots _and_ provide
          useful logging.

Wed Apr  9 18:24:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Don't run 3171 with CORBA/e micro

Wed Apr  9 11:50:27 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VXTestProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a need_to_write_project override method to only allow the
          project file to be written if it is an executable project.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VXTestWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an invalid base module was used in the @ISA.

Wed Apr  9 11:41:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Check for ACE_VXWORKS

Wed Apr  9 07:18:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Export ACE_Threading_Helper, it is used as protected class
          member

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
          Don't use ACE_LIB_TEXT

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.h:

          Give the argument a name so that doxygen can do its work

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:
          Use scoping

        * ace/MMAP_Memory_Pool.{h,cpp}:
          Add a bool flag to indicate whether the signal handler has to
          be installed or not. Made some other flags bool and win32 there
          is no need have a signal handler as member. This fixes bugzilla
          3290

Wed Apr  9 01:21:42 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Condition_T.cpp (wait): Fixed a bug where the mutex
          parameter wasn't being used properly if abstime was 0.  Thanks
          to Andriy Gapon <avg at icyb dot net dot ua> for reporting this.

Mon Apr  7 18:49:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/docs/templates/gnu.txt:
          Document linkflags

Mon Apr  7 15:21:38 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          This the second part of the SC refatoring.  It builds on top of
          the intrusive refcounting mechanism introduced earlier to improve
          design and eliminate memory issues (leaks, SEGV on shutdown)

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (open_i,ACE_Service_Config):

          Moved the implicit configuration file handling from open_i to
          the SG instance. Eliminated close_svcs() by incorporating its
          functionality in close().

        * ace/Service_Config.inl:
        * ace/Service_Config.h (ACE_Service_Config_Guard,ACE_Service_Config):

          Removing the inheritance relationship between Service Config and
          Service Gestalt. To simplify the memory management, SC becomes an
          interface to the actual configuration data managed by SG. Coupled
          with the reference counting of SG instances, this ensures correct
          memory management in multi-threaded environments where both the
          TSS and the user code may trigger SG finalization.

          Introducing ACE_Threading_Helper to simplify TSS management
          (RAII idiom).  Changed ACE_Service_Config_Guard to use the new
          smart pointer for SG.  Doxygen comments cleanup.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Fixing unused function definition

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:

          Updating the test to prevent it from breaking vxWorks builds
          which appear to lack a declaration for dlopen()

Sun Apr  6 01:53:13 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Fixing unused variable warning.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Ensuring there are no TAB characters present in the generated
          file.

        * THANKS:

          Adding Michael Carter <mcarter at swri dot org> for reporting
          and debugging bug 3007.

        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.h:
        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.cpp:

          Storing a pointer to SG that was current in the parent thread,
          which enables correct "inheritance" of the SG in the child thread.

        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:

          Fixing ACE_Stream_Node::{apply,link} to ensure the modules are linked
          together and initialized correctly - see bug# 2916. Moving the
          initialization code out of the yacc parser, here.

        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:

          Improving the log output in fini().

        * ace/Service_Repository.h:

          Eliminating an unused parameter static_only from relocate_i()

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:

          Simplified relocate_i() and fixed an error that was causing it to
          choose incorrect ranges of service indexes to relocate.
          Eliminated the boolean static_only parameter as it was always
          being set to true.  Changed remove() to eliminate the "packing"
          code and updated the few other methods, which assumed there are no
          "gaps" in the service storage.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Adding an overloaded yyerror that takes just a string to comply
          with the changed bison template. Moving the module initialization
          code out of the parser. See ACE_Stream_Node class and bug# 2916.

        * ace/Thread_Adapter.cpp:

          The invoke() method, which runs in the new thread, initializes the
          thread-specific configuration context. This scheme ensures any
          newly spawned thread would inherit the spawning thread's service
          configuration context.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Adding Intrusive_Auto_Ptr to the list.

        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

        * apps/JAWS/stress_testing/benchd.cpp:

          Using "interface" as the descriptive name of a parameter seems to

Sun Mar 30 19:54:23 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          This is the first step of merging the changes from the gestalt
          refactoring branch. It includes only changes that are merely
          peripheral, without impacting the actual configuration mechanism
          - yet.

        * ace/ARGV.h:
        * ace/ARGV.cpp:

          Introducing a ctor that takes the number of parameters in argv,
          thus eliminating the requirement to have argv 0-terminated.  This
          requirement can be a hard to satisfy in cases where the argv has
          been "manualy constructed", i.e. not provided by the OS
          environment.

        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.inl:
        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.cpp:

          Added an intrusive auto pointer implementation. It is a reference
          counted auto pointer that can be used for types with explicit
          reference management implementations.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:

          Introducing new argv_to_string which takes an explicit argc
          argument and relaxes the requirement on argv (to be 0-terminated).

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.inl:

          Adding a mechanism that provides a correct conversion to boolean
          for smart pointers, which preserves the smantics of "if (ap) ..."
          without the unwanted side effects. Credit goes to Andrei
          Alexandrescu's Modern C++ Design book.

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:

          Cosmetics: adding this-> to member references.

        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/ASX_CCM_App.mpc:
        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/CCM_App.cpp:

          Fixing a problem that precludes the test from running correctly
          on *nix - the DLL names are not case-insensitive. Minor layout
          changes.

        * tests/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr_Test.cpp:

          A test for the new auto ptr.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          Position the iterator on the first element that is none zero, fixes
          crashing of the reactor_dispatch_order_test on non windows platforms

Fri Mar 28 17:18:50 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (write_long_placeholder, write_short_placeholder):
          Be careful to adjust and grow the stream's block before taking
          the pointer that's returned to the user. Thanks to Alain Kocelniak
          <alain@corys.fr> for this fix.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h: Note that the placeholder methods return 0 if
          the method fails due to insufficient memory.

Tue Mar 25 14:19:31 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          When generating the linker command line for executable linked against

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/MPC.cfg:

          MPC can now be configured to recognize ACE_TMAIN as an executable
          entry point. We no longer need to explicitly state that a project will
          be an executable in the MPC file, MPC will automatically deduce that
          the project is an executable given the presence of ACE_TMAIN.

          This change above relates to the following change in MPC:

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm: Add support for running tests on

          to explicitly set exename in the MPC file.

        * performance-tests/TTCP/C/new-ttcp.cpp:
        * tests/Unload_libACE.cpp:

          Disable fuzz's check_for_improper_main_declaration check on these files.
          These files don't use ACE.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Added -r as option to specify an alternate root test directory
          instead of the current directory. Combined this with -l we can
          then run perl scripts for testing project code.

Thu Feb 28 16:08:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/generate_compile_stats.sh:
          Added --compiler as option so that we can specify a different
          compiler then gcc

Thu Feb 28 08:32:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/ACE-bug-process.html:
          Removed cvs

Wed Feb 27 19:28:18 UTC 2008  William Otte  <wotte@william-ottes-macbook-pro.local>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          disable mcpp by default.

Tue Feb 26 15:52:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Added support for buildbits=64

Tue Feb 26 09:18:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Added some compiler flags to reduce the number of warnings/errors
          in the OpenVMS builds

Mon Feb 25 19:44:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:
          Added IgnoreHostRoot which can be set from a test script. That way
          when doing cross host testing we can make sure we don't get the
          executable from the host root directory. This is for example usefull
          when we want to spawn perl or another system utility

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Removed commented out line

Mon Feb 25 14:30:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.2.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.3.GNU:
          Added LD_PARTIALFLAGS which can be set for footprint builds

Mon Feb 25 08:13:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Set ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN when
          ACE_THR_FUNC_RETURN is an integral type

        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN to determine whether
          we can do a reinterpret_cast or static_cast. This is much easier
          then checking all compilers

Sun Feb 24 19:37:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Configuration.cpp:
        * ace/Configuration.h:
        * ace/Configuration.inl:
          Added new inline file

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:
          Prefix increment

        * ace/Event_Handler.h:
          Removed commented out code

Sat Feb 23 06:56:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          OpenVMS doesn't have rwho

Fri Feb 22 18:55:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue_NT.h:
          Fixed wrong include

Fri Feb 22 14:20:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * ace/Message_Queue_NT.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Moved ACE_Message_Queue_NT to its own file

Fri Feb 22 08:54:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/global.features:
          Default optimize_collocated_invocations to 1

Fri Feb 22 00:34:17 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added !LabVIEW_RT to all tests that haven't
          been adapted to the non-local filesystem mechanism I invented to run
          tests for LabVIEW RT targets (and can also be used for other target
          types). Now I can enable TAO tests for the LabVIEW RT scoreboard
          build.

Thu Feb 21 15:25:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/Download.html:

        * etc/index.html:
          Updated for x.6.3

Thu Feb 21 02:34:37 CST 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
