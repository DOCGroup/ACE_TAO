        Set of changes applicable to VxWorks, particularly 6.9. These changes
        were contributed by Jeff Fowler and Gordon Hulpieu at NetApp. Feel
        free to contact me with any issues.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.{h cpp inl}: Change from using the VxWorks TCB
          spare4 value to a new static member of ACE_TSS_Emulation. This
          mechanism covers both VxWorks multicore (SMP) using the __thread
          attribute and single core using Task Var. This change gets ACE out
          of the way of the applications that use spare4 for their own
          purposes.
          Also fixes for various compiler warnings.

        * ace/OS_NS_sys_socket.inl (accept): Add IPv6 case to the
          ACE_HAS_BROKEN_ACCEPT_ADDR case.

        * ace/config-vxworks6.9.h: Correct the ACE_HAS_BROKEN_ACCEPT_ADDR
          setting for VxWorks 6.9+.

        * ace/OS_NS_dlfcn.inl (dlsym): For VxWorks, use the symFind() call
          instead of the deprecated symFindByName().

        * ace/Process.cpp: Fix a weird compile diagnostic by adding what should
          be a needless space.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.9.GNU: Update MUNCH_FLAGS
          for this version.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Add -Wnon-virtual-dtor to the default CCFLAGS

        * tests/Message_Block_Large_Copy_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compile error on LynxOS.
