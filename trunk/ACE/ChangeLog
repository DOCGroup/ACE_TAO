        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:
          Added IgnoreHostRoot which can be set from a test script. That way
          when doing cross host testing we can make sure we don't get the
          executable from the host root directory. This is for example usefull
          when we want to spawn perl or another system utility

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Removed commented out line

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.2.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.3.GNU:
          Added LD_PARTIALFLAGS which can be set for footprint builds

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Set ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN when
          ACE_THR_FUNC_RETURN is an integral type

        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN to determine whether
          we can do a reinterpret_cast or static_cast. This is much easier
          then checking all compilers

        * ace/Configuration.cpp:
        * ace/Configuration.h:
        * ace/Configuration.inl:
          Added new inline file

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:
          Prefix increment

        * ace/Event_Handler.h:
          Removed commented out code

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          OpenVMS doesn't have rwho

        * ace/Message_Queue_NT.h:
          Fixed wrong include

        * ace/Message_Queue.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * ace/Message_Queue_NT.{h,cpp,inl}:
        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Moved ACE_Message_Queue_NT to its own file

Fri Feb 22 08:54:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/global.features:
          Default optimize_collocated_invocations to 1

Fri Feb 22 00:34:17 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added !LabVIEW_RT to all tests that haven't
          been adapted to the non-local filesystem mechanism I invented to run
          tests for LabVIEW RT targets (and can also be used for other target
          types). Now I can enable TAO tests for the LabVIEW RT scoreboard
          build.
