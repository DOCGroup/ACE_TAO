	* ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp
	* ace/High_Res_Timer.h
	* ace/High_Res_Timer.inl
	  Use 64bit calculations to increase our precision. If you want to have the 32bit
	  calculations, add ACE_USE_WINDOWS_32BIT_HIGH_RES_TIMER_CALCULATIONS as define. If
	  the scoreboard doesn't show any platforms requiring 32bit, we will remove that code
	  before the next micro release goes out
	  Thanks to Alon Diamant <diamant dot alon at gmail dot com> for supplying the patches.
	  This fixes bugzilla 3703.

	* ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp
	* ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.h
	* ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.inl
	  Make it possible to use a customer event handler in ACE_Thread_Timer_Queue_Adapter.
	  Thanks to Alon Diamant <diamant dot alon at gmail dot com> for supplying the patches.
	  This fixes bugzilla 3614

	* tests/tests.mpc:
	* tests/Thread_Timer_Queue_Adapter_Test.cpp:
	  New test for testing custom event handlers in ACE_Thread_Timer_Queue_Adapter.
	  Thanks to Alon Diamant <diamant dot alon at gmail dot com> for creating
	  this new test

        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Unix.pm:

          Added an option to use the 'expect' program to interact with
          the remote target (via telnet).  This is only enabled when the
          environment variable ACE_RUN_VX_USE_EXPECT is defined.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:

          Updated the ACE_VXWORKS version check to include version 6.8.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Added !VxWorks to exclude Pipe_Test which can't be run
          on VxWorks (kernel mode) because it depends on ACE_Process::spawn().

        * ace/OS_NS_math.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_math.inl:
          Rewrote ceil and floor functions using templates and overloaded
          ceil/floor functions provided by standard C++.

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Added tests for ceil(float) and floor(float).

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          PPU 4.1.1 for PPC doesn't have atomic builtin support
          for datatypes of size 1 and 2

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          Added defines to just disable short/unsigned short/bool specializations

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Enable 2610 but mark it as not fixed

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp:
          Layout change

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp:
          Const changes

        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Fixed bug#2609 and enabled the test for it. Thanks to Milan
          Cvetkovic <milan dot cvetkovic at mpathix dot com> for
          contributing this.

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Some platforms have been reported to return undef from
          $FindBin::RealBin.  In this case, fall back on dirname($0).

        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.inl:
          Fixed gcc warning

Mon Mar  8 08:35:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          Added specializations for bool/unsigned short/short, is around 7 times
          faster than the default atomic op

Mon Mar  8 08:24:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Added tests for short/unsigned short/bool

        * configure.ac:
          Added test for GCC builtin support

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          We did a benchmark on a FC10 64bit system with the GCC builtin support
          for long/unsigned long. In a release/inline build the performance
          results using the GCC builtin support is around 2 times faster than
          when using the ACE assembly version. When we have the GCC builtin support,
          we now also going to use that for long/unsigned long.

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.cpp:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.inl:
          Added new Atomic template for the GCC builtin atomic op support.
          This is used on PPC64/PPC32/IA64 for int/unsigned int/long/unsigned long.
          On EM64T we do use this for int/unsigned int, the ACE assembly version for
          long/unsigned long is faster than the GCC.

          On FC10 64bit the int/unsigned int Atomic_Op is now around 6 to 7 times
          faster than before this change

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          Enable the new builtin atomic also for EM64T

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added new files

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Print the number of iterations

Fri Mar  5 11:28:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Also measure postfix increment/decrement

Fri Mar  5 11:21:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Added more checks to make sure Atomic_Op does work

Tue Mar  2 21:02:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (mask_ops_i): If the specified handle is
          not registered, return -1 instead of crashing.

Thu Mar  4 09:15:54 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Fix for problems with creating MPC release tag.

Thu Mar  4 07:50:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Rewritten this test to use a template method so that we can
          test atomic op easily for various data types

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:
          Layout changes and fixed compile problem with CB2010. This fixes
          bugzilla 3835, thanks to Jan Kalin <jan dot kalin at zag dot si>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          CB also has long timevalue mismatch

Thu Mar  4 07:50:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * NEWS:
          Updated for next micro

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec:
          Fixed problem with installation of nslist readme

        * etc/index.html:
          Added 5.7.7

        * docs/Download.html:
          Updated for 5.7.7

        * docs/bczar/bczar.html:
          Several updates because we now package on a FC12 system

        * debianbuild/rules:
          Removed commented out part

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Next micro release will not ship msvc71 solutions, it is still
          supported but the end user should generate the solutions him self.
          Also WinCE solutions are not generated anymore for CIAO and the
          autoconf bootstrapping is done much earlier in the release process
          so when it fails we know early. The hostname check has been removed

        * bin/diff-builds-and-group-fixed-tests-only.sh:
          Updated because of micro release
