        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Added constants ACE_FLT_MIN and ACE_DBL_MIN to provide consistency
          with ACE_FLT_MAX AND ACE_DBL_MAX.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:
        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp:

          Enhanced the ACE_CDR::LongDouble class which is used on platforms
          where the native long double is not 16 bytes.

          Provided operators to support multiplication, division, addition
          and subtraction as well as conversion to the native long double.

          An assign() method is also provided to set the value of the
          ACE_CDR::LongDouble.  Since this class will be stored in a union
          (if used as an IDL type), it can not have a non-trivial constructor
          or assignment operator.  The existing
          ACE_CDR_LONG_DOUBLE_INITIALIZER macro is used to initialize the
          LongDouble and a new macro, ACE_CDR_LONG_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT, is
          used to assign to the LongDouble in a portable fashion.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added the new TAO LongDouble test.

Wed Jan 31 17:30:46 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: If stdcpplib=0 is
          selected at build time, explicitly set -AP compile option to use
          old C++ libraries and no std namespace. Also set
          ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS when -AP is set - there is a numeric_limits
          but not in std. Note that ACE_Array_Map won't build with stdcpplib=0
          but pre-ACE-5.5 legacy code will still build.

          Also removed the HP-UX 10.x remnants and pre-3.0 aC++ support
          from platform_hpux_aCC.GNU. Could probably safely remove more old
          compiler support (anything older than 3.56 probably) but I played
          it a little conservative for now.

Wed Jan 31 17:22:11 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * protocols/examples/examples.mwc:

          Removed the implicit usage.  It is not necessary since each
          example has a .mpc file.

        * protocols/examples/example_base.mpb:

          Removed this file.  It was not needed.

Wed Jan 31 16:55:23 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h:

          Removed #define ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS as it seems to be both rarely
          used (only oddball platforms like unixware and other QNX versions
          have it) and also incompatible with inline=0 builds.
          Also added new config macros ACE_LACKS_STRPTIME (June 2006) and
          ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_READDIR_R (December 2006).
          These modifications have been tested with QNX 6.3 but from the docs
          on the QNX web site I believe they apply to QNX 6.2 as well.

Wed Jan 31 15:44:54 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp:
          Use sigval (which is SUS defined) instead of sigval_t. If this
          change doesn't break on any platform I'll remove unnecessary
          typedef and related stuff.

Wed Jan 31 13:31:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Removed obsolete checks for environment macros

        * ace/Recycable.h:
          Removed empty brief doxygen tag

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Renamed ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SZ_PAGESIZE to ACE_HAS_NOTSUP_SC_PAGESIZE

Wed Jan 31 13:21:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Added improvement for GCC on HPUX IA64

Wed Jan 31 10:17:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Improved support for GCC on HPUX IA64

Wed Jan 31 07:50:44 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (ACE_OS::sched_params):  Check if the
          ACE_id_t id that is being passed in is equal to ACE_SELF.  If
          so, pass ::GetCurrentProcessId() to ::OpenProcess() instead of
          id.  ACE_SELF is defined to be 0 on ACE_WIN32; process id 0 is
          the zero-page process, and we certainly don't want to attempt to
          set it to REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS :-)

Wed Jan 31 03:25:51 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.h:

          Removed the special case default definition of
          ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION to ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_MSECS on Windows;
          added a #ifndef around the default definition in case the user
          wishes to change it.  This was done to prevent useless values
          like 0 showing up in calculations using ACE_Basic_Stats when the
          time intervals are of the order of a few microseconds.  Most of
          the current machines have a QueryPerformanceCounter()
          implementation that returns a value of atleast 3 MHz.  So it
          should be completely safe to use the definition of
          ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_USECS as the default value for
          ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION on contemporary x86 machines running
          Windows.

        * ace/Message_Block.inl:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          Moved the definition of
          ACE_Dynamic_Message_Strategy::priority_status() from
          Message_Block.inl to Message_Block.cpp.  It was a big function
          and it currently has code that causes a warning with VC8 on
          Windows.

Tue Jan 30 19:21:50 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Module.h:

          Removed the trailing comma from the last element of the enum.

Tue Jan 30 16:26:43 UTC 2007  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/sets-manager.py:

          Modified to pin the version of MPC at the time of branching/tagging
          under modules/ACE/MPC.  Note:  This does not branch OR tag MPC,
          it simply causes the branch/tag to check out a specific
          revision of MPC.

Tue Jan 30 13:51:32 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Module.h:
        * ace/Module.cpp:

          There was no way to distinguish between flags not being set and
          flags to indicate that tasks should not be deleted.  I have
          changed the M_DELETE_NONE enum value to 4 and added a new enum
          value for use in flag initialization.  With this change, the
          close() method can determine if it needs to use the flags passed
          in or the internal flags.  This fixes Bugzilla #2497.

Tue Jan 30 11:35:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Countdown_Time.{h,cpp}:
          Readded destructor, missed that it updates the max_wait_time
          passed to the constructor

Tue Jan 30 10:44:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          When pipes is set to 1, also add -pipe to the CCFLAGS

        * include/makeinclude/platform_rtems.x_g++.GNU:
          Set pipes to 1, set DCCFLAGS

Tue Jan 30 10:14:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Unbounded_Set.cpp:
          Initialise pointer with 0.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (getpagesize):
        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          RTEMS does define _SC_PAGESIZE, but using sysconf with _SC_PAGESIZE
          results in -1. Added a new define ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SC_PAGESIZE to be
          able to disable the usage of sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE) for rtems 4.6,
          the ::getpagesize() function returns a correct value.

Tue Jan 30 09:46:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Added a test for ACE_OS::getpagesize(), it should return a value
          bigger then 0 else the memory pools don't work

Tue Jan 30 00:25:00 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: If the user sets RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE to
          keep a lot of the standard C++ library out of the std namespace,
          avoid setting ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB, and also
          hoist everything else from std into the global namespace. This is
          necessary because RW wasn't consistent with using their internal
          _RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE and the user-settable RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE and
          some things end up in std and some not; so get the ones that ended
          up in std out to global with the rest of them.

          Layout changes, result of experimenting with a code
          beautifier

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Improved rtems port, added support for building with
          threads=0

        * ace/config-sco-5.0.0.h:
          Removed commented out define

        * ace/config-vxworks6.4.h:
          putenv fails with VxWorks 6.4 with a pentium target

        * ace/Countdown_Time.{h,cpp}:
          Use bool, removed return value from most methods, it was
          meaningless, removed destructor, not needed to update members
          in a destructor

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
          Export Token_Guard, fixes bugzilla 2786, thanks to
          <sailzeng at tencent dot com> for reporting this

        * OS_NS_pwd.inl (getpwnam_r):
          Initialize pointer with 0, simplified this a little

        * docs/ACE-guidelines.html:
          Updated example with doxygen style of documentation

Thu Jan 25 19:59:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          The include of rules.cia.GNU must come before the include of
          rules.tao.GNU in order for CIAO libraries to have the correct
          version numbers.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          Fixed the -l option to use the correct variable name and corrected
          a bug where the script changed to the wrong directory if the -l
          option was used.

          lacks this method has to set an explicit define, maybe it now shows
          that all platforms have this method and we don't need an emulation
