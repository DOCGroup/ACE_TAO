                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp:
                  Need to release the internal timer queue lock before dispatching
                  calls in expire_single(), otherwise we get nasty deadlocks in
                  the TP_Reactor implementation.

        Thu Jul  2 02:55:09 UTC 2009  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@glamdring>

                * ace/Abstract_Timer_Queue.h:
                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.h:
                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.inl:
                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp:
                  I wanted to use gettimeofday() for the pure virtual function and
                  some other name for the inline function used in the timer queue
                  internals.
                  This is the second and final pass to get that change in.  This
                  time, I renamed the internal function to gettimeofday_static(),
                  used the compiler (and grep) to find all uses.  Once that
                  compiled I renamed the virtual function from
                  gettimeofday_abstract() to the gettimeofday() function.
                  I know it is convoluted, but it gets the job done without me
                  having to think too much.

                * ace/Event_Handler_Handle_Timeout_Upcall.cpp:
                  First I noticed that this class did not depend on the lock type
                  at all, this was fortunate because I wanted to use it in a
                  generic way.  So, change the class from a template class to a
                  regular class.  That required moving the class to its own file too.

                * ace/Timer_Heap_T.h:
                * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp:
                  Fixed several inconsistencies across these classes, for example,
                  most of them had typedef as a shorthand for the base class, but
                  the name of this typedef was not consistent.
                  Likewise, not all of the classes made the TIME_POLICY parameter
                  a default template parameter.

                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.h:
                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.inl:
                * ace/Timer_Queue_T.cpp:
                  Introduced an intermediate class between Abstract_Timer_Queue<>
                  and Timer_Queue_T<>.  This is ugly, but the Proactor "needs" to
                  set a back-pointer from the FUNCTOR to the Proacter instance
                  whenever a timer queue is assigned to the Proactor.
                  This code smells funny.  Either the API is wrong (the Proactor
                  should always create the functor with the backpointer,) or the
                  need for the back pointer is suspicious (I think there is a
                  thread in the Proactor that signals timers, but maybe it should
                  be contained in the Upcall object itself?)
                  The more I look here, the uglier the smell.

                * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:
                * ace/Timer_Queue_Adapters.cpp:
                * tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test.cpp:
                * tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp:
                  As a temporary measure, I appended "_abstract" to the
                  gettimeofday() function name in Abstract_Timer_Queue<>.
                  Shortly, I will change the Timer_Queue_T<> class to use
                  gettimeofday_non_virtual() or _static() or something similar.
                  Had to make the change in two steps to find all the uses of the
                  original function.
                  There was probably an easier/cleaner way to do this.

                * tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp:
                  Take advantage of the new ACE_Abstract_Timer_Queue<> to make the
                  different types of queues more compatible in ths test, including
                  queues with different time source policies.

                * ace/Proactor.h:
                  As with the Reactive version, I noticed that
                  ACE_Proactor_Handle_Timeout_Upcall did not depend on its
                  template parameter, so I changed the class to a non-template
                  version.

                * ace/Proactor.cpp:
                  Instead of making the Proactor a friend of the Timer_Handler
                  task, expose a safe interface to do what the proactor wants to
                  do.
                  The proactor needed access to timer queue internal details to
                  implement schedule(), but the reactor did not... hmmm... well,
                  turns out the Reactor had nicely refactor that work to the
                  upcall functor.  So I did the same in the Proactor case.

                * ace/Abstract_Timer_Queue.h:
                  Remove the setter for getimeofday(), this is implemented by the

                  Said class class is no longer a template class, so use it
                  correctly.
                  Changed name of gettimeofday() in timer queue to
                  gettimeofday_abstract()  This is a temporary change to find all
                  the uses, will revert again soon.

                * ace/Timer_Heap_T.cpp:
                  Heavy refactoring in ACE_Timer_Queue_T class and friends.
                  First, created a template base class (ACE_Abstract_Timer_Queue) that:
                  1) Only depends on the type held by the timer queue, not to lock
                    or upcall strategy.
                  2) It is a pure abstract class, i.e., none of its member
                    functions have any implementation.
                  3) Provides new pure virtual functions to encapsulates some
                    logic that was spread between tests, TP_Reactor and
                    Dev_Poll_Reactor.
                  Then I re-wrote all the standard timer queue objects in terms of
                  this class.  In particular, the reactors use only the abstract
                  interface.
                  I also re-factored the Timer_Queue_Iterator to only depend on
                  the type of objects held by the timer queue.  The rest of the
                  parameters where not used either.
                  Implement functionality that was spread in Dev_Poll_Reactor,
                  TP_Reactor and a test into expire_single.

                * ace/Proactor.h:
                * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
                * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
                  Both classes implemented the logic to dispatch a single timer
                  but release a mutex before the upcall.  This was confusing as
                  well as required exposing too much detail about the Timer_Queue
                  classes.
                  The new mechanism is a single function in (expire_single)
                  ACE_Abstract_Timer_Queue<> (implemented in ACE_Timer_Queue_T<>)
                  which receives a command object to encapsulate the mutex release.

                * ace/Functor_T.h:
                * ace/Functor_T.inl:
                  Add helper ACE_Command_* objects.  One is a no-op, for the test
                  below.  The other is a callback that ignores the silly void*
                  argument in the ACE_Command_Base::execute() member function.

                * tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test.cpp:
                  Re-factored test in terms of expire_single()

                * This is a temporary commit into the 3707 branch.  I realized too
                  late that the changes from 3706 will be needed to make this work.

                * ace/ace.mpc:
                * ace/Time_Policy.h:
                * ace/Time_Policy.inl:
                * ace/Time_Policy.cpp:
                  New classes to encapsulate how "now" is computed in the Timer
                  Queues.   This will be an additional template parameter, so the
                  default configuration has zero overhead.

                  Modify test to use TIMER_POLICY.  But here is the rub, the test
                  does not compile because all timer queue types are "different"
                  to each other.  I need to introduce the base class from the
                  bug-3706 branch to make things work.

                  Heavy refactoring in ACE_Timer_Queue_T class and friends.
                  First, created a template base class (ACE_Abstract_Timer_Queue) that:
                  1) Only depends on the type held by the timer queue, not to lock
                    or upcall strategy.
                  2) It is a pure abstract class, i.e., none of its member
                    functions have any implementation.
                  3) Provides new pure virtual functions to encapsulates some
                    logic that was spread between tests, TP_Reactor and
                    Dev_Poll_Reactor.
                  Then I re-wrote all the standard timer queue objects in terms of
                  this class.  In particular, the reactors use only the abstract
                  interface.
                  I also re-factored the Timer_Queue_Iterator to only depend on
                  the type of objects held by the timer queue.  The rest of the
                  parameters where not used either.
                  Implement functionality that was spread in Dev_Poll_Reactor,
                  TP_Reactor and a test into expire_single.

                * ace/Proactor.h:
                * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
                * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
                  Both classes implemented the logic to dispatch a single timer
                  but release a mutex before the upcall.  This was confusing as
                  well as required exposing too much detail about the Timer_Queue
                  classes.
                  The new mechanism is a single function in (expire_single)
                  ACE_Abstract_Timer_Queue<> (implemented in ACE_Timer_Queue_T<>)
                  which receives a command object to encapsulate the mutex release.

                * ace/Functor.cpp:
                * ace/Functor_T.h:
                * ace/Functor_T.inl:
                  Add helper ACE_Command_* objects.  One is a no-op, for the test
                  below.  The other is a callback that ignores the silly void*
                  argument in the ACE_Command_Base::execute() member function.

                * tests/Timer_Queue_Reference_Counting_Test.cpp:
                  Re-factored test in terms of expire_single()
