        * ace/UUID.cpp (get_timestamp_and_clocksequence): Case clock sequence
          value using ACE_UINT16 instead of u_char to prevent duplicates
          when many UUIDs are generated quickly. Thanks to Wim van den Boogaard
          for this fix. Resolves Bugzilla #3313.

Tue Apr 29 19:52:48 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp: Simplify the timer_handler_ task spawn and
          shutdown. Also, if close() sees an error from the implementation's
          close, don't stop closing. Things are most likely already ripped
          apart too far to recover from, and it's likely to cause a hang to
          just try to stop closing now.

        * ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp: Correctly handle the ACE_Message_Block
          pointers passed to operations and later updating when complete.
          Thanks to Fernando C. Jeronymo <fernando dot fcavalcanti at
          gmail.com> for diagnosing this problem.

        * THANKS: Added Fernando C. Jeronymo to the Hall of Fame.

        * tests/Proactor_UDP_Test.cpp: Fix to close down correctly in
          half-duplex mode.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl: Removed all the pre-ACE_HAS_WINNT4 code in the
          file locks methods. This was the only place left in ACE that
          referred to ACE_HAS_WINNT4; all pre-NT4 support was removed last
          year from the rest of ACE. This also corrects behavior of file
          locks as well as ACE_RW_Process_Mutex.

        * ace/RW_Process_Mutex.h: Doxygen improvements.

        * ace/SOCK_CODgram.h: Doxygen improvements.

        * ace/SOCK_CODgram.cpp (open): If either of the local or remote
          addresses is specified, use its address family rather than the
          value of protocol_family. If both are specified, they must match.

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp: Added a counting test to validate the
          queue's message counting.

          a race condition (the spawned process exits normally before we even
          check its status).

          Changed ACE_Refcountable to ACE_Refcountable_T which has a
          trait for the type of lock. ACE_Refcountable is now a typedef
          of ACE_Refcountable_T<ACE_Null_Mutex>. Also the refcount

        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Removed file above

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Changed the template instantiations like we have for Atomic_Op.

Mon Apr 14 09:54:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Don't build 2980 with wchar enabled and added empty resource
          file section

Mon Apr 14 08:59:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Threading_Helper_T.cpp:
          Added new file with the threading helper template code. This resolves
          the strange link problems with BCB. This file is included in the
          Service_Config.h file

        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added new files

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Include the new Threading_Helper_T.cpp and removed the implementation
          from these files

        * tests/tests.mpc:
          Added missing include for bug 2980

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.inl:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Moved ACE_Threading_Helper ctor and dtor implementaion
          inline. This makes them available to code that indirectly
          references the threadkey_ member (like, in examples/). This
          should resolve link-time problems with borland compilers.

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp (unloadDll):

          Fixing warnings about missing extern "C" qualifier in call to
          pthread_create.

Sun Apr 13 07:27:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (_vx_call_entry):
          Set the sc::current before calling main. This resolves the
          sc asserts with vxworks kernel mode. Thanks to Iliyan
          for suggesting this addition

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Including config-lite.h: the driver is non-ACE but it still
          needs to know platform-specific stuff, like threads usage,
          etc.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Fixing a fuzz build warning of a missing $Id. Also, not all
          make(1)'s have $(MV), so changing mpb to use just "mv"

Thu Apr 10 22:32:58 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Fixing compile problems with single-thread-only builds - using
          the compiler's abilities (partial specialization) to generate
          appropriate code.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Token_Table.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Changes to fix compile problems related to versioned namespace
          use. Eliminated custom token file post-processing - replaced
          with a wrapper header file (yacc(1) is now producing
          Token_Table.h, which gets included in Tokens.h)

Thu Apr 10 14:42:04 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:

          Adding YYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED to prevent yacc(1) from trying to use a
          trivial definition of YYSTYPE.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:

          Fixing an unused variable warning. Adding an YYSTYPE guard.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:
        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Undefining YYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED at the bottom of Svc_Conf_Tokens.h
          prevents it from leaking and poluting the global namespace. This
          allows other yacc(1) based parsers to be used in ACE
          apps. Cleaning up and recording generated files.

Thu Apr 10 13:27:13 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:

           Fixed compilation issues and reversed the CAN_RUN_TEST check to
           get it to run on non-win32 and non-vxworks operating systems.

Thu Apr 10 10:11:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Simplified the build sequence reducing the number of additional
          transformations needed for Bison's parser output. That includes
          the elimination of the ACE_YY prefix, which was necessary only
          because of these transformations.  Added ACE_TEXT around naked
          string literals. Fixed build warnings with unicode builds.

Wed Apr  9 20:22:46 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

Wed Apr  9 11:50:27 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VXTestProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a need_to_write_project override method to only allow the
          project file to be written if it is an executable project.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/VXTestWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an invalid base module was used in the @ISA.

Mon Apr  7 15:21:38 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          This the second part of the SC refatoring.  It builds on top of
          the intrusive refcounting mechanism introduced earlier to improve
          design and eliminate memory issues (leaks, SEGV on shutdown)

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (open_i,ACE_Service_Config):

          Moved the implicit configuration file handling from open_i to
          the SG instance. Eliminated close_svcs() by incorporating its
          functionality in close().

        * ace/Service_Config.inl:
        * ace/Service_Config.h (ACE_Service_Config_Guard,ACE_Service_Config):

          Removing the inheritance relationship between Service Config and
          Service Gestalt. To simplify the memory management, SC becomes an
          interface to the actual configuration data managed by SG. Coupled
          with the reference counting of SG instances, this ensures correct
          memory management in multi-threaded environments where both the
          TSS and the user code may trigger SG finalization.

          Introducing ACE_Threading_Helper to simplify TSS management
          (RAII idiom).  Changed ACE_Service_Config_Guard to use the new
          smart pointer for SG.  Doxygen comments cleanup.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Fixing unused function definition

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:

          Excluding Bug_2980_Regression as it is not runnable on vxWorks.

          Making SG intrusively refcountable by introducing
          intrusive_{add,remove}_ref methods and a refcounter. Adding
          skip_default_svc_conf_file parameter in process_directives.

        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

        * THANKS:

          Adding Michael Carter <mcarter at swri dot org> for reporting
          and debugging bug 3007.

        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.h:
        * ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.cpp:

          Storing a pointer to SG that was current in the parent thread,
          which enables correct "inheritance" of the SG in the child thread.

        * ace/Parse_Node.h:
        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:

          Fixing ACE_Stream_Node::{apply,link} to ensure the modules are linked
          together and initialized correctly - see bug# 2916. Moving the
          initialization code out of the yacc parser, here.

        * ace/Service_Object.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:

          Improving the log output in fini().

        * ace/Service_Repository.h:

          Eliminating an unused parameter static_only from relocate_i()

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp:

          Simplified relocate_i() and fixed an error that was causing it to
          choose incorrect ranges of service indexes to relocate.
          Eliminated the boolean static_only parameter as it was always
          being set to true.  Changed remove() to eliminate the "packing"
          code and updated the few other methods, which assumed there are no
          "gaps" in the service storage.

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf.y:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_Tokens.h:
        * ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

          Adding an overloaded yyerror that takes just a string to comply
          with the changed bison template. Moving the module initialization
          code out of the parser. See ACE_Stream_Node class and bug# 2916.

        * ace/Thread_Adapter.cpp:

          The invoke() method, which runs in the new thread, initializes the
          thread-specific configuration context. This scheme ensures any
          newly spawned thread would inherit the spawning thread's service
          configuration context.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          Adding Intrusive_Auto_Ptr to the list.

        * ace/svcconf.mpb:

          Updated for the grammar updates, see bug# 2916.

        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/ASX_CCM_App.mpc:

Tue Apr  1 12:52:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Add the DSI Gateway exception test, they should run, the scoreboard
          will show if they run

Tue Apr  1 08:33:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:

Tue Apr  1 07:38:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr_Test.cpp:
          Fixed argument not used warning

Tue Apr  1 07:34:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Enabled a few tests for vxworks

Tue Apr  1 07:12:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test.cpp:
          Only run the reactor once, this will lead to the failing of this test
          when using the WFMO Reactor which seems to be a old issue that needs
          to get addressed

Tue Apr  1 06:54:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          Disabled most tests for vxworks and vxworks_rtp, we first need to
          convert a lot of scripts to support vxworks

Mon Mar 31 21:48:58 UTC 2008  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * configure.ac:

          Changed to avoid feature test for pthread_getaffinity_np() and
          pthread_setaffinity_np() if system does not have cpu_set_t. In
          that case, the pthread functions are amost certainly not
          compatible.

        * ace/Makefile.am:

          Add Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.cpp, Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.h, and
          Intrusive_Auto_ptr.inl to nobase_include_HEADERS.

Mon Mar 31 18:56:40 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.inl:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.cpp:

          Reverting the changes because a) they are not really necessary
          for the refactoring of the service config, and; b) the AIX
          compiler appears to not deal well with implicit conversion
          definitions, to template member types.

Mon Mar 31 16:15:17 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Adding Intrusive_Auto_Ptr_Test to the list

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.inl:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.cpp:

          Added preprocessor guards for proper inlining. Qualified
          the type name in the implementation of opretator
          unspecified_bool_type () to appease GCC 3.x

Mon Mar 31 13:50:45 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          Adding Intrusive_Auto_Ptr_Test to the list

Mon Mar 31 12:09:20 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/AutomakeWorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Always reference Kokyu libraries from $(ACE_BUILDDIR) instead of
          $(top_builddir) so that it will work from both ACE and TAO.

Mon Mar 31 11:00:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Dll.cpp:

Mon Mar 31 08:59:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Added test for ACE_OS::last_error()

Sun Mar 30 19:54:23 UTC 2008  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          This is the first step of merging the changes from the gestalt
          refactoring branch. It includes only changes that are merely
          peripheral, without impacting the actual configuration mechanism
          - yet.

        * ace/ARGV.h:
        * ace/ARGV.cpp:

          Introducing a ctor that takes the number of parameters in argv,
          thus eliminating the requirement to have argv 0-terminated.  This
          requirement can be a hard to satisfy in cases where the argv has
          been "manualy constructed", i.e. not provided by the OS
          environment.

        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.inl:
        * ace/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr.cpp:

          Added an intrusive auto pointer implementation. It is a reference
          counted auto pointer that can be used for types with explicit
          reference management implementations.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp:

          Introducing new argv_to_string which takes an explicit argc
          argument and relaxes the requirement on argv (to be 0-terminated).

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.inl:

          Adding a mechanism that provides a correct conversion to boolean
          for smart pointers, which preserves the smantics of "if (ap) ..."
          without the unwanted side effects. Credit goes to Andrei
          Alexandrescu's Modern C++ Design book.

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:

          Cosmetics: adding this-> to member references.

        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/ASX_CCM_App.mpc:
        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/CCM_App.cpp:

          Fixing a problem that precludes the test from running correctly
          on *nix - the DLL names are not case-insensitive. Minor layout
          changes.

        * tests/Intrusive_Auto_Ptr_Test.cpp:

          A test for the new auto ptr.

        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Dll.cpp:
        * tests/Bug_2980_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Addded a test for bug 2980. Thanks to Lothar Werzinger <lothar
          at tradescape biz> for contributing the code.

Sun Mar 30 18:54:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Win32.pm:
          Handle single quotes in the executable arguments

Sat Mar 29 08:16:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test.cpp:
          Dev_Poll reactor displays other bugs, so disable this part of
          the test

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          Position the iterator on the first element that is none zero, fixes
          crashing of the reactor_dispatch_order_test on non windows platforms

Fri Mar 28 17:18:50 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (write_long_placeholder, write_short_placeholder):
          Be careful to adjust and grow the stream's block before taking
          the pointer that's returned to the user. Thanks to Alain Kocelniak
          <alain@corys.fr> for this fix.

        * ace/CDR_Stream.h: Note that the placeholder methods return 0 if
          the method fails due to insufficient memory.

        * THANKS: Added Alain Kocelniak to the Hall of Fame.

Fri Mar 28 15:40:03 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/unload_libace.mpb:

          Inhert from vc_warnings instead of duplicating part of it's
          functionality.

Fri Mar 28 09:24:25 UTC 2008  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Enabled a test to Bug_3276_Regression.

Fri Mar 28 09:17:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Reactor_Dispatch_Order_Test.cpp:
          Extended this test to also test suspend/resume_handlers and the
          dev_poll reactor. Thanks to Russell Morra for extending this test

        * ace/ACE.cpp:
        * ace/High_Res_Timer.inl:
          Layout changes

          Fixed done implementation. This fixes bugzilla 3267

        * ace/String_Base.cpp:
          Initialise pointer with 0

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Bool changes, fixed implementation of suspend_handlers/resume_handlers,
          the to_be_added set modifications where not done correctly

        * ace/Object_Manager.cpp:

          In Win32 debug builds with ACE_DISABLE_WIN32_ERROR_WINDOWS, also
          redirect assert messages to stderr instead of GUI message boxes.

        * tests/SSL/Thread_Pool_Reactor_SSL_Test.cpp:

          Changed ACE_TMAIN to run_main for the non-threaded portion of the
          #ifdef.  ACE_TMAIN is defined in Main.cpp.

Thu Mar 27 12:37:18 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/snmperrs.h:

          Added an unknown error code message to the pErrs array to avoid
          getting a garbage pointer from Snmp::error_string() in the event
          that the error code is outside the valid range.

Thu Mar 27 11:11:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Free_List.cpp:

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Make it possible to specify an alternate name / location for
          platform_macros.GNU. This fixes bug #3269.

          executable projects that pull in source files from other directories.

Tue Mar 25 18:02:52 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ASNMP/asnmp/wpdu.cpp:

          dereferencing.

Tue Mar 25 14:19:31 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          When generating the linker command line for executable linked against
          static libs, exclude the "libFoo.a" form of the libraries.  They are
          already accounted for by "-lFoo" arguments.  This resolved Bugzilla
          Bug #3266.

Tue Mar 25 10:43:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Mon Mar 24 16:21:30 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (event_timedwait): Fixed this code so that
          it will treat 0 using "wait indefinitely" semantics for Windows
          and all other OS platforms.  Thanks to Paul Carter <pcarter at
          scires dot com> for contributing this.

Mon Mar 24 16:13:51 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Manual_Event_Test.cpp (worker): Added a test to ensure
          that a null pointer works properly for the
          ACE_Manual_Event::wait() method.  Thanks to Paul Carter <pcarter
          at scires dot com> for contributing this.

Mon Mar 24 15:43:28 UTC 2008  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/MPC.cfg:

          MPC can now be configured to recognize ACE_TMAIN as an executable
          entry point. We no longer need to explicitly state that a project will
          be an executable in the MPC file, MPC will automatically deduce that
          the project is an executable given the presence of ACE_TMAIN.

          This change above relates to the following change in MPC:

        * bin/PerlACE/TestTarget_LVRT.pm: Add a GetFile() method to get a file
          from the target to the local machine. By default, it does nothing.
          It's meant for use by targets that don't necessarily have locally
          accessible file systems, such as LabVIEW RT.

        * bin/Run_Test.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm: Add support for running tests on
          LabVIEW RT similarly to the way they're done on VxWorks; TAO tests
          run the server on the target and the client on the host.

Fri Mar 14 09:30:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_g++.GNU:
          Don't use -mcpu=common, that is an ancient default of AIX 5.1

          This fixes bugzilla 3147

Wed Mar 12 11:59:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/FoxReactor/FoxReactor.{h,cpp}:
          Removed check for ACE_HAS_FOX

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Changed fox handling, matches the other reactors. Thanks to

Tue Mar 11 12:24:43 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h: Add #include "ace/config.h" so a setting for
          ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE can be seen. Fixes compile warnings.

Tue Mar 11 12:20:02 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed compile error. No need to use
          ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR for a char* literal.

Mon Mar 10 22:27:09 UTC 2008  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@wakefield.txcorp.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf.h: Removed redundant inclusion of Obstack.h.  It is
          included later in Svc_Conf_Param.h.  Removing this extra
          inclusion allows us to build on MacOS Leopard with optimization
          enabled.

Mon Mar 10 15:35:02 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h cpp} (log): For %C, clearly note that it always prints
          a narrow-char string, and adjust the va_arg to match. Thanks to
          Russell Morra for reporting this issue.

Mon Mar 10 13:20:57 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Multicast_Test.cpp:

          message.

Sat Mar  8 16:23:57 UTC 2008  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (send): Enhanced the code to allow sends
          of 0-sized datagrams.  Thanks to Andi Heusser <aheusser at gmail
          dot com> for this fix.

Thu Mar  6 16:49:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
          Rearranged some rules to make sure c/C files are compiled with the
          C compiler on OpenVMS

Thu Mar  6 13:10:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Wed Mar  5 07:54:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:
          Don't run the parallel connect strategy test on VxWorks 5.5, the
          command length of the shell is not long enough.

Tue Mar  4 09:27:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ProcessVX.pm:
          Added a retry to the iPass protocol code, in a full test run
          we sometimes see that the reboot has failed. With this retry
          we hopefully get rid of those false test failures

Tue Mar  4 05:54:22 UTC 2008  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/svn_props.py:
          Automatically set default properties when svn complains.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Added -r as option to specify an alternate root test directory

        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN to determine whether
          we can do a reinterpret_cast or static_cast. This is much easier
          then checking all compilers

Fri Feb 22 00:34:17 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added !LabVIEW_RT to all tests that haven't
          been adapted to the non-local filesystem mechanism I invented to run
          tests for LabVIEW RT targets (and can also be used for other target
          types). Now I can enable TAO tests for the LabVIEW RT scoreboard
          build.
