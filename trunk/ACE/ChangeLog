        * ACE version 6.0.4 released.

Thu Aug 18 01:31:48 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          Reverted the change from Mon Aug 15 14:41:24 UTC 2011 Douglas
          C. Schmidt <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>. This change caused a
          regression failure that showed up on some of the TAO tests. We
          can try reintroducing this patch after the upcoming release.

Wed Aug 17 15:01:28 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Fix typo in SYSROOT default example.

Wed Aug 17 13:54:12 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          Unfuzz.

Mon Aug 15 14:41:24 UTC 2011  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp: Replaced the recursive version of
          ACE_Message_Block::clone() with a non-recursive version to avoid
          problems when there are large numbers of message blocks.  Thanks
          to Andrew Metcalfe <andrew dot metcalfe at ccur dot com> for
          reporting this and suggesting the fix, which was provided by
          Eric Frias <efrias at syncad dot com>.

Sun Aug 14 10:44:32 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec:
          Added support for inline, thanks to Thomas Lockhart for providing
          the patch

Wed Aug 10 20:15:40 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
        * NEWS:

          Add a note about support for Android in the news, and add more
          detail to the installation steps.

Wed Aug 10 19:02:21 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:

          Updated the text related to installing for Android.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_android_linux.GNU:

          Added this file.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_android.GNU:

          Removed this file.

          Renamed the file to be consistent with others, now the name is
          target platform first followed by the build-specific name. The
          settings for cross compilation are now configured inside this
          platform file, using som assumptions for architecture.

          The build for the arm architecture works, but it looks like x86
          still needs work by the NDK team, it was just added in their r6
          release. I've submitted a bug report to the android team with a
          suggested patch.

Wed Aug 10 17:14:01 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32.h:
          Removed one include too much

Wed Aug 10 12:41:18 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Enable ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE by default, it gives
          much better performance and also doesn't suffer the issue that them
          reactor queue can get full

Wed Aug 10 12:18:56 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Notification_Queue.inl:
        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Layout changes

Wed Aug 10 11:45:28 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
        * ace/config-win32.h:
          Moved define to the common file

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Removed support for C++ Builder, the port is broken and not maintained
          for years.

Tue Aug  9 17:28:15 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * debian/patches/series:
          Updated because of removed files

        * debian/patches/16-ace-inet-pkgconfig-files.diff:
        * debian/patches/prevent_doxygen_ace_manpages.diff:
          Removed these files, integrated into trunk

Tue Aug  9 17:17:56 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h:
          Added if !defined checks around all defines in this file

Mon Aug  8 21:46:01 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl:

          Fix some inconsistencies in the new android-specific wrappers.

        * ace/config-android.h:

          Android does not supply std::wstring

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_android.GNU:

          The android supplied compiler gives a preemptive warning about
          va_args mangling change, but I cannot find anything to change
          in the ACE code, so I added the recommended warning suppressor.

Thu Aug  4 22:11:26 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-android.h:

          unfuzz.

          Added configuration files and minor changes to allow building
          for Android using the Android Native Development Kit's standalone
          tool chain. http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
          Android is not a completely tested platform and automated testing
          does not work for it currently. Thanks to Trevor Fields of OCI
          for doing the heavy lifting on preparing these changes.

          Enhanced the check for ACE_TRACE messages so that it works
          correctly with class definitions such as those found in
          examples/APG/ThreadPools/Futures.cpp.

Fri Jul 22 12:29:59 UTC 2011  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Malloc_T.cpp: Fixed ACE_Dynamic_Cached_Allocator so that it
          doesn't overflow.  Thanks to Qiao Zhiqiang <qiaozhiqiang at
          leadcoretech dot com> for this fix.

Fri Jul 22 12:27:16 UTC 2011  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/Cached_Allocator_Test.cpp (run_main): Updated this test to

Wed Jul 20 23:52:46 UTC 2011  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-win64.h: Added this file to make it more clear how to
          build ACE on a 64-bit Windows platform.  Thanks to Thomas Pauli
          <thomas dot pauli at tu-dortmund dot de> for contributing this
          fix.

Fri Jul  1 10:28:10 UTC 2011  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
          Added missing ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR. Should also resolve
          CDR stream op compile problems.

Fri Jul  1 10:01:54 UTC 2011  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

          constants in IDL.

Tue Jun 21 18:14:46 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Fixed typo in ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII
          decision tree. Thanks to Phil Mesnier <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>
          for his help in connecting it to scoreboard warnings.

Mon Jun 20 17:39:01 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Another tweak to ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII's
          logic aimed at warnings on FC6, FC8, FC12, and FC15.

Mon Jun 20 17:17:26 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-mingw.h:
        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          - Moved the definition of ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII
            to the MinGW config file.

          - Added #define ACE_CDR_IMPLEMENT_WITH_NATIVE_DOUBLE 1 to
            the MinGW config file, so that, for generated IDL long
            double constants, the argument will agree with the
            print format string. MinGW doesn't support long double
            in the print format.

Fri Jun 17 16:48:29 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Another tweak to ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII's
          conditional definition to eliminate warnings on FC12
          and FC15.

Fri Jun 17 12:48:31 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Removed the 'L' from the version of
          ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII targeted at MinGW
          platforms. That platform apparently doesn't support that
          part of the C print format spec.

Thu Jun 16 13:31:16 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Changed the logic of what ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII
          expands to in order to eliminate warnings on FC6 and FC8.

Wed Jun 15 13:10:40 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Added a special version of ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII
          for MinGW32, which seems to diverge from other platforms in how
          it conforms to the printf print format.

Fri Jun 10 19:05:30 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Added #define of ACE_LONG_DOUBLE_FORMAT_SPECIFIER_ASCII
          to make generation of a long double literal by the TAO IDL
          compiler more portable.

Fri Jun 10 12:58:49 UTC 2011  Marcel Smit  <msmit@remedy.nl>

        * ChangeLog:
          Fuzz. Removed tab.

Thu Jun  9 01:16:23 UTC 2011  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp: Fixed overly long ACE_TRACE string literals
          that were split across lines.  Thanks to Espen Harlinn <espen at
          harlinn dot no> for reporting this.

Wed Jun  8 21:05:56 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Switch from cvs to svn for the -m option that checks only modified
          files.  We haven't used cvs for some time now.

Tue Jun  7 20:45:56 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          The inline function needs to be static to match the semantics of
          a struct constructor when the environment has native long
          doubles.

Tue Jun  7 18:20:36 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          Added an inline function called LongDoubleAssign tha works
          as an alternative to the struct constructor of the same
          name when a 16-byte native long double exists and the struct
          is not defined. Thanks again to Adam Mitz <mitza at ociweb dot com>
          for the idea.

Mon Jun  6 22:17:26 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          The struct just added by Jeff also needs the export macro.

Mon Jun  6 19:51:27 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp:
        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          Added a struct LongDoubleAssign which inherits from LongDouble,
          and contains the assignment operator and constructors, as well
          as a cast operator to LongDouble. This scheme allows generated
          code to use the LongDouble struct (when no 16-byte native long
          double exists) as a member in C++ unions, and to be initialized
          (when it appears as a constant) with the default copy constructor
          from LongDouble, converted from the supplied LongDoubleAssign,
          which is in turn initialized from the rhs literal. Thanks to
          Adam Mitz <mitza at ociweb dot com> for the LongDoubleAssign
          suggestion to work around the C++ union restriction.

Mon Jun  6 16:59:29 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/Download.html:
          Fixed typo

        * include/makeinclude/platform_g++_common.GNU:
          Added support for c++0x, adding this to your platform_macros.GNU
          enables the g++ c++0x extensions

Mon Jun  6 13:44:14 UTC 2011  Marcel Smit  <msmit@remedy.nl>

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SSL_SAP/SSL-client-simple.cpp:
          Fixed gcc 4.6 warning.

Fri Jun  3 18:46:50 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          Made the ACE_CDR::LongDouble struct constructor from native
          long double explicit, which eliminates compiler ambiguities
          when the struct's '==' and '!=' operators are used with
          a native long double rhs.

Wed Jun  1 19:30:44 UTC 2011  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp:
        * ace/CDR_Base.h:

          To the struct ACE_CDR::LongDouble, used for platforms with
          a native long double that isn't 16 bytes, added an
          assignment operator and a constructor. The former is for
          internal use by the IDL compiler, and the latter is for
          code generation for long double constants. For types
          using the non-native struct, a const declaration is
          impossible to initialize by assignment to a literal,
          so a constructor is generated instead.

Wed Jun  1 10:17:33 UTC 2011  Marcel Smit  <msmit@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Made changes to satisfy Coverity and the GNU 4.6 gcc compiler.
          fgets returns a void*. This is stored in dummy. We use
          ACE_UNUSED_ARG to fool the 4.6 gcc compiler.

Thu May 12 18:08:47 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Added command settings for
          preprocessing C and C++ source files.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Added rules to preprocess
          C and C++ files when directed.

          These allow one to now quickly produce a preprocessed version of
          a source file. Ala... make -f GNUmakefile.ACE ACE.i
          would preprocess ACE.cpp and put the result in ACE.i.

Thu May  5 21:38:45 UTC 2011  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp:

          Added a reset of errno during the ctor in case there was an
          error during the first attempt at opening the reactor. Turns out
          that in this case on at least on Linux, the errno leaks through
          the second, good call to open. This can happen for example, when
          ACE::max_handles() is less than the select reactor's DEFAULT_SIZE.
          Since all this happens in a ctor, there's no result value for
          application code to check, apart from errno.

Wed May  4 15:07:46 UTC 2011  Chad Beaulac <chad.beaulac@objectivesolutions.com>

          * ace/Stream.cpp:
          Modified ACE_Stream::remove(name,flags) so close
          is always called on the module that's removed regardless of the
          flags. Close needs to be called to ensure proper lifecycle
          management when the ACE_Service_Repository shuts down in its
          fini method.  Bugzilla #3912

        * tests/Bug_3912_Regression_Test.conf:
        * tests/Bug_3912_Regression_Test.cpp:
        * tests/run_test.lst
        * tests/test.mpc
          Added test to assert that close is called.

Fri Apr 29 14:01:29 UTC 2011  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc: For Message_Queue_Test add -bmaxdata:0x20000000 to
          linker options to extend the available data space at run time.
          Avoids the heap smashing the stacks.
