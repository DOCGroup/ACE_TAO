        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Client_Test.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/createfile.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:

          Fixed ACE_OS fuzz warnings. Use ACE_OS calls instead of raw OS functions
          where possible. If fuzz detected a false-positive, then disable
          the ACE_OS fuzz check for that section of the code.

        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:

          Untabify.

        * ace/Local_Name_Space.cpp:
          Resolve 64-32-bit transition warnings.

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h: Define ACE_MALLOC_ALIGN using a sizeof cast.
          Makes it fit with the other ACE_MALLOC_* calculations in Malloc.h
          without triggering 32/64-bit warnings.

        * tests/SOCK_Connector_Test.cpp: Added some additional diagnostics
          re the address info that's being tried to easier note IPv4 vs.
          IPv6 addresses. Also removed an ACE_ASSERT.

        * tests/Process_Manual_Event_Test.cpp: Added a hack to always delete
          the underlying shared memory objects on AIX, primarily due to the
          inability to neatly clean these objects up after a failed test.
          See Bugzilla #2662 for further background. Also, added a delay
          in the child process to allow the parent to initialize the event
          objects. The race between the processes while the parent is
          initializing the event objects can cause the child to hang.

          Added checks for byteswap.h, intrin.h, ia32intrin.h, and
          ia64intrin.h, part of buzilla 2905.
