        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (mask_ops_i): If the specified handle is
          not registered, return -1 instead of crashing.

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Rewritten this test to use a template method so that we can

          for reporting this.

        * NEWS:
          Updated for next micro

        * rpmbuild/ace-tao.spec:
          Fixed problem with installation of nslist readme

        * etc/index.html:
          Added 5.7.7

        * docs/Download.html:
          Updated for 5.7.7

        * docs/bczar/bczar.html:
          Several updates because we now package on a FC12 system

        * debianbuild/rules:
          Removed commented out part

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Next micro release will not ship msvc71 solutions, it is still
          supported but the end user should generate the solutions him self.
          Also WinCE solutions are not generated anymore for CIAO and the
          autoconf bootstrapping is done much earlier in the release process
          so when it fails we know early. The hostname check has been removed

        * bin/diff-builds-and-group-fixed-tests-only.sh:
          Updated because of micro release
