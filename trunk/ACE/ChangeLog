          Remove unneeded includes from ACE.h. ACE.h is included a lot,
          and bringing in any extra includes increases the risk of
          namespace collisions.

          All the cpp files above were implicitly dependent on ACE.h to
          include, which are now explicit.

        * ace/Process.cpp (spawn): Supply correct type to command_line_buf()
          call, per change below.

Thu Aug 29 22:06:55 UTC 2013  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (swab): Added support for ACE_HAS_INT_SWAB for
          platforms where the 'length' arg to swab() is an int instead of
          the standard ssize_t.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Added ACE_HAS_INT_SWAB

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp: Added a ACE_OS::swab() test.

        * ace/Process.h:
        * ace/Process.inl: Changed ACE_Process::command_line_buf(int*) to
          command_line_buf(size_t*) to align with the member whose value is
          returned.

        * ace/README: Added ACE_HAS_INT_SWAB description.

        * NEWS: Added the ACE_Process::command_line_buf() API change note.

        * THANKS: Updated John Lilley's email address. Thanks to John for
          noticing the busted 64-bit Windows builds that flagged the above
          issues with compile warnings.
