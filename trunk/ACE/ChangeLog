        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (swab): Added support for ACE_HAS_INT_SWAB for
          platforms where the 'length' arg to swab() is an int instead of
          the standard ssize_t.

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp: Added a ACE_OS::swab() test.

        * ace/Process.h:
        * ace/Process.inl: Changed ACE_Process::command_line_buf(int*) to
          command_line_buf(size_t*) to align with the member whose value is
          returned. 

        * ace/README: Added ACE_HAS_INT_SWAB description.

        * NEWS: Added the ACE_Process::command_line_buf() API change note.

        * THANKS: Updated John Lilley's email address. Thanks to John for

          issues with compile warnings.
