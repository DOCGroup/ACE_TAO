        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.inl (recv_i): Added back in logic to wait
          for data available to receive when called with a timeout. Thanks
          to Ossama Othman for helping to sort this out. For reference, the
          issues involved here are well-explained in "SSL and TLS" by
          Eric Rescorla, section 8.9.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (recv_n): Removed the hack-y retry on
          EWOULDBLOCK - the proper handling of timeouts is now in its proper
          place in recv_i() - see above.

        * ace/config-macosx-leopard.h:
          Added missing defines to get ACE to compile on MacOSX, thanks to
          Thomas Lockhart <Thomas dot Lockhart at jpl dot nasa dot gov>
          for reporting this

        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.h:
        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.inl:
        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.cpp:
          These files have been removed. They appear to be completly unreferenced by any
          other files in the whole ACE/TAO/CIAO/DAnCE distribution and are not even currently
          built within the Kokyu library itself. They appear to be incomplete relics of the
          original 2003 development of this library, and include references to an incomplete
          class Dispatch_Deferrer_Attributes which has no declaration or definition anywhere
          in the current distribution. These files would not compile even if they where listed
          in the kokyu MPC file.
