        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core_anytypecode.mpb:
          Removed svn:executable property

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core_strategies.mpb
          New base project for the strategies library when build in
          ace_for_tao configuration

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:
          Removed -GT so that we also don't generate TIE files for the
          orbsvcs anymore. Will speedup builds and simplify other mpc
          files

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/strategies.mpb
          Derive from core_strategies. Now the strategies library
          does get build in an ace_for_tao configuration but
          shmiop and uiop are not build at all, other protocols
          can be build. This way we can build COIOP in an ace_for_tao
          setup

        * bin/make_release:
          Removed dsp/dsw reference, corrected naming of the ACE
          packages when the version number gets added.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Removed HPUX 10.20 support

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:
          ACE_HAS_BROKEN_THREAD_KEYFREE is now set in the config file

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Removed ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 checks

        * docs/bczar/bczar.html:
          Updated this file

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp:
          Added ACE_HAS_SIGVAL_SIGVAL_INT, this fixes bugzilla
          bug 2716. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues
          <rodrigc at crodrigues dot org> for reporting this.

        * ace/ace.mpc:

          for reporting this.

        * Release:
          Removed dsw files

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
        * ace/config-posix-nonetworking.h:
          Moved the configuration to build without no networking
          support to its own file so that we can reuse this for
          example on linux

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Added support for rtems 4.7

        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h:

        * ace/config-linux.h:

          Moved ACE_HAS_GETIFADDRS to the common file and added
          support for ACE_LACKS_NETWORKING on linux

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp
          Fixed compile problem when using ACE_LACKS_NETWORKING on
          linux

        * ace/Obstack.h:
          Use ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARATION to resolve link errors
          on FC6. Thanks to Ken Sedgwick <ken at bonsai dot com> for
          reporting this and testing out the patch.

        * ace/OS_NS_string.inl:
