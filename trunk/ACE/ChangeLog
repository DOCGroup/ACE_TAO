Sat Oct 20 14:13:07 UTC 2012  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.h: Added a forward declaration of
          ACE_Event_Handler to ensure ACE compiles properly on certain
          platforms.  Thanks to Peng Xu <pengxu7 at gmail dot com> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:
          Reflect fact that Event classes are now templates.
          Added new Event base class.

Tue Nov  6 14:44:38 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (ACE_TSS_Cleanup::thread_detach_key): If
          given a key which was never set, ignore it. Only throw an assertion
          if the key's table slot is used but does not match the key asked
          to free. The never-set case happens if a ACE_TSS object fails
          when setting its value; the later cleanup would cause an assert.

Tue Nov  6 13:34:20 UTC 2012  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * NEWS:
          Updated for new time policy support for ACE Events.

        * ACE version 6.1.5 released.

Wed Oct 10 22:45:23 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Reactor.h: Corrected the comments concerning removal of
          signal handler registrations - they DO call handle_close() now.

        * tests/Network_Adapters_Test.{cpp, h}: Corrected the call to remove
          signal handlers and added a check in Stop_Handler::handle_close()
          to ignore calls as a result of removing a signal handler.

Mon Oct  8 13:27:58 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Sig_Handler.{cpp, inl}: Reverted change from:
          Fri Oct  5 23:09:40 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          to initialize signal_handlers_ array. It's static so can't be
          changed all the time. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for finding this.

Fri Oct  5 23:09:40 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Sig_Handler.{cpp, inl}: Initialize signal_handlers_ array.

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp: Shut things down in close() and make all the
          info changes to avoid referencing unregistered handlers later, when
          they may be invalid. The lifetime can't be controlled via close() as
          it can via remove_handler() so be sure no references bleed out.

        * tests/Bug_2368_Regression_Test.cpp: Clean up text literals.

Thu Oct  4 10:24:52 UTC 2012  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:

Wed Oct  3 09:59:08 UTC 2012  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:

          Intel C++

Thu Sep 27 06:30:22 UTC 2012  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          Introduced a new ACE_HAS_CPP11 which is set with GCC 4.7 at

Fri Sep 21 08:06:31 UTC 2012  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:

Thu Sep 20 07:09:41 UTC 2012  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:

          the long long specializations below.

Thu Sep 13 16:46:03 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl: Added specializations for "long long" and
          "unsigned long long" for GCC to get the better performance
          for 64-bit integers.

Tue Sep 11 18:59:35 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Fri Sep  7 20:00:51 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.inl (recv_i): Remove the incorrect comment
          form the syscall case about falling through to the default. That's
          not right. Thanks to Simon Massey for pointing this out.

Fri Sep  7 19:43:12 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Sig_Handler.cpp (remove_handler_i): Check if the event handler
          pointer is 0 before calling through it. Thanks to Adam Mitz
          for catching this one.

Thu Sep  6 18:51:47 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Sig_Handler.h:
        * ace/Sig_Handler.cpp: Call back to ACE_Event_Handler::handle_close()
          when a signal handler is removed by any means. The callback was
          previously made only when dispatched handle_signal() returned -1.
          This adds the callback when the signal handler is unregistered
          either explicitly or by a containing reactor closing. Resolves
          Bugzilla #2368.

        * ace/Process_Manager.h:
        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp: Added a handle_close() method to be notified
          when a reactor with which SIGCHLD is registered closes, so no
          attempt is later made to remove the SIGCHLD registration.

        * NEWS: Describe the above enhancement.

        * tests/Bug_2368_Regression_Test.cpp: Register the two handlers for
          different signals so they're both tracked and removed properly.

        * tests/run_test.lst: Enable Bug_2368_Regression_Test.

Thu Sep  6 15:06:15 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (close): Don't try to lock/unlock the
          ACE_LOG_MSG_INSTANCE lock if it's already been freed.

Wed Sep  5 20:09:09 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.inl (recv_i): Added back in logic to wait
          for data available to receive when called with a timeout. Thanks
          to Ossama Othman for helping to sort this out. For reference, the
          issues involved here are well-explained in "SSL and TLS" by
          Eric Rescorla, section 8.9.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (recv_n): Removed the hack-y retry on
          EWOULDBLOCK - the proper handling of timeouts is now in its proper
          place in recv_i() - see above.

        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.h:
        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.inl:
        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.cpp:
          These files have been removed. They appear to be completly unreferenced by any
          other files in the whole ACE/TAO/CIAO/DAnCE distribution and are not even currently
          built within the Kokyu library itself. They appear to be incomplete relics of the
          original 2003 development of this library, and include references to an incomplete
          class Dispatch_Deferrer_Attributes which has no declaration or definition anywhere
          in the current distribution. These files would not compile even if they where listed
          in the kokyu MPC file.
