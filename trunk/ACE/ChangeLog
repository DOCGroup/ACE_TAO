        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Client_Test.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/createfile.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:

          Fixed ACE_OS fuzz warnings. Use ACE_OS calls instead of raw OS functions
          where possible. If fuzz detected a false-positive, then disable

        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:

          Untabify.

          without triggering 32/64-bit warnings.

Sat Jul 28 22:50:12 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SOCK_Connector_Test.cpp: Added some additional diagnostics

          IPv6 addresses. Also removed an ACE_ASSERT.

Sat Jul 28 21:58:27 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Process_Manual_Event_Test.cpp: Added a hack to always delete
          the underlying shared memory objects on AIX, primarily due to the
          inability to neatly clean these objects up after a failed test.
          See Bugzilla #2662 for further background. Also, added a delay
          in the child process to allow the parent to initialize the event
          objects. The race between the processes while the parent is
          initializing the event objects can cause the child to hang.
