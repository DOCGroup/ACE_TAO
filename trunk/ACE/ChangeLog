        * bin/ace_tests.lst:
        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:
          guard against running the HTBP and HTIOP tests on systems that
          do not build ACE_UUID, such as the compact builds.

Thu Aug 23 19:39:27 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:
          Added some TAO projects to the list in an attempt to fix
          the WinXP_VC71_CIAOCore_Static_Debug build.

Thu Aug 23 15:07:01 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Allow POSIX semaphores to be used with UI Threads
          (ala Solaris) if the functions are there.

Thu Aug 23 05:35:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.inl:
          Don't use ACE_LIB_TEXT, but ACE_TEXT

Wed Aug 22 22:31:00 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Signal_Test.cpp: When sigwait()-ing, restart the wait if
          interrupted by an uncaught signal. This happens on Solaris 9, for
          example, when a threading-related signals happen. Gets this test
          working correctly for Solaris 9.

        * protocols/tests/HTBP/Send_Recv_Tests/server.cpp:
        * protocols/tests/HTBP/ping/server.cpp:

          Add a small sleep in the server right before closing the socket.
          This helps reduce the likelyhood that tests will fail on windows
          if the server happens to close before the client has read the
          last bit of data on the conection.

Wed Aug 22 21:28:38 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/ace_tests.lst: Marked RMCast tests to only run if the RMCAST
          config is set. This effectively disables it everywhere pending some
          requested feedack from the ACE users community on usage.

Wed Aug 22 21:24:07 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Multicast_Test.cpp: Log the joined multicast groups.

        * tests/Multicast_Test_IPV6.cpp: Fixed string logging and a leak.

Wed Aug 22 19:59:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Added wall GNU make variable which is default set to 1, which then
          adds -Wall to the CFLAGS. This option results in a lot of warnings
          related dllimport which makes it not really usable, with GCC 4.x
          we can disable that warning, but not with GCC 3.4, so the user can
          set wall=0 to disable the usage of -Wall

Wed Aug 22 18:10:09 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.inl (open): If open fails, include the
          error reason in the logged message.

        * ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h: Documentation improvements.

        * ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp: Corrected logging of pointers to use
          %@ instead of %d or %u.

        * ace/MMAP_Memory_Pool.cpp (map_file): When remapping a previous
          mapping, try to use MAP_FIXED unless the memory pool option
          NEVER_FIXED is also set. Resolves a problem of mapping to a
          different region when remapping an existing area on RHEL 4 x64.
          Also fixed logging of pointers and size_t to use %@ and %B.

Wed Aug 22 18:09:45 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * m4/compiler.m4: For AIX xlC and Solaris CC 4.2, always turn on
          RTTI support. ACE requires it, and for these compilers, the default
          is RTTI disabled. The previous code used the rtti-enabled flag
          which was removed at:

Wed Aug 22 15:58:55 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * bin/msvc_static_order.lst:

          Added CIAO projects to the list. This may need further tweaking.
          Hopefully this will address problems in the
          WinXP_VC71_CIAOCore_Static_Debug build.

Wed Aug 22 11:32:41 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/msvc_mpc_auto_compile.pl:
        * bin/msvc_static_compile.pl:
          Use the word error when detecting an unknown option, this way the
          autobuild scripts will tag this as error on the scoreboard

Wed Aug 22 08:15:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          -Wno-attributes is only available with GCC 4.x. Removed support
          for GCC 2.95

Wed Aug 22 06:23:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          The GCC compiler on windows gives a lot of warnings about attributes
          that are ignored. These are not usefull, so added no_attributes
          which by default is set to 1 which then disable this warning. If you
          want to see these warnings, set no_attributes=0 to your
          platform_macros.GNU file

Tue Aug 21 21:07:24 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp (ACE_Client_Logging_Acceptor):
          Added an optional argument to the client logging daemon setup:
          -llocal-ip[:local-port]  - this allows one to specify the local
          address and port number for the connection to the server logging
          daemon. If the port number is not specified, it defaults to 0 (select
          an unused port) and if -l is not specified, the host's defaults
          are applied (as in all previous versions).

        * NEWS: Describe the above addition.

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
          Service_Config::parse_args_i was improperly splitting arguments
          that may contain spaces, such as explicit service directives.
          This patch addresses that explicitly quoting unknown arguments
          being passed on to the Service_Gestalt::parse_args_i. I removed
          unparsed args from the gestalt's list of known args, and cleaned
          up a bad error message.

          a reclic from the older days of ACE, it was used to silence
          incorrect warning from g++  compiler. Moved the destructor to

        * ace/config-linux-common.h: Only include config-posix.h when
          ACE_HAS_LINUX_NPTL is defined; effectively reverts:
          Mon Aug 13 04:40:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
          to fix broken RHEL 3 test results. RHEL 3's NPTL is not quite up to
          snuff, apparantly (NPTL version 0.60) but even simply removing
          ACE_HAS_LINUX_NPTL didn't do the trick. This effectively puts things
          back the way they were for RHEL 3 and lets others stay with the
          newer scheme of including config-posix.h.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_common.GNU: Refined the NPTL
          check to only set ACE_HAS_LINUX_NPTL when the NPTL version is not
          0.x. This works with the above to allow RHEL 4 et al to go on with
          the new scheme and leave RHEL 3 at the old settings.

        * configure.ac: When checking for pthread_attr_setstack(), don't use
          the ACE_CHECK_LACKS_FUNCS macro - the underlying autoconf macros
          generate code that will compile/link on HP-UX 11iv2 because there's
          an entrypoint for it in libpthread, but it's not supported. So
          check with a hand-crafted short code segment. Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen for this idea.

        * configure.ac: Adjusted the checks for "new throws..." to grab
          much larger chunks; helps it run quicker and more accurately.

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Part of fix for bug 2995. Both the Service Config and Service
          Gestalt have separate open counts, but multiple calls to open_i
          on the Service Config were not propogated to Service Gestalt.
          This led to a problem where closing a multiply opened Service
          Config would result in a premature clean up of resources in the
          Gestalt, triggering a crash later on.

        * ace/Service_Types.cpp:
          Make debugging output more clear.

        * tests/New_Fail_Test.cpp: Allocate the hugest blocks we can instead
          of many merely big ones. Helps the test run without dragging the
          system to a crawl, at least on my WinXP VC7.1 box w/ 1GB memory.
          YMMV. Not ready to re-enable in tests/run_test.lst until a few
          other people try this out by hand.
          Also, replace ACE_ASSERT with if/else and ACE_ERROR.

          Fix up the tests to run cleanly in a nightly build environment
          This is primarily fixing the configuration so that it does not
          depend on an external proxy, but will use one if locally
          configured to do so. Also fixed up the test output and command
          line processing to make it more consistent with other tests.

          I've not turned on the automatic running of these tests just
          yet, I'd rather wait and just make sure the build is clean. We
          can turn on the automatic run at some point later now that the
          tests are cleaned up.

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          only check the core of ACE/TAO for tabs. This will prevent the

          Instead of making all ACE_ defines dependent on winsock2, just for each
          one check if the non ACE define exists or not. If it exists, use it, if
          not, use a special ACE value. This makes it easier to support QoS with

          Added ACE_HAS_BROKEN_THREAD_KEYFREE so that on Linux the Log_Msg
          does cleanup its TSS data which resolves problems when loading
          and unloading the ACE shared library from an application that
          doesn't use ACE at all

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.{h,inl}:
          Changed to use Atomic_Op for the refcount and use a long instead
          of int. That way we can benefit from the Atomic_Op optimizations

        * ace/Bound_Ptr.{h,inl}:

          which wasn't set in any config file

Mon Aug  6 07:58:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configure.ac:
          Added a check whether we have a 1 or 2 param mkdir method. This
          fixes bugzilla 2006. The other defines mentioned in this
          issue are not added because they are for VxWorks 5.5 only which
          we don't actively maintain anymore

Sun Aug  5 19:27:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/SStringfwd.h:
          Check if __HP_aCC is defined before checking its value, fixes
          a remark in the Intel C++ autoconf build

Sat Aug  4 22:07:05 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Removed the pthread_cond_timedwait() check - it was
          used to set ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM_TIMEOUT and ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM_TIMEOUT_
          EMULATION, neither of which it is related to. Added a correct check
          for sem_timedwait (ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM_TIMEOUT).
          Also, used shortcut functions instead of hand-coding tests for
          pthread_attr_setstackaddr and pthread_attr_setstacksize.

        * m4/ace.m4: Add --enable-posix-sem-timeout-emulation, corresponding
          to ACE_DISABLE_POSIX_SEM_TIMEOUT_EMULATION.

        * m4/config_h.m4: Corrected description of ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM_TIMEOUT
          and added ACE_DISABLE_POSIX_SEM_TIMEOUT_EMULATION. Also, because
          of use of shortcuts (above) can remove templates for
          ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKSIZE and
          ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKADDR.

        * m4/compiler.m4: For IBM Visual Age C++ and XL C++, use manual
          template instances (-qnotempinc -qnotemplateregistry) because I
          haven't found a way to name the template registry from the
          Makefiles and without that, building multiple items in one directory
          clashes. Some people have reported the need to use manual template
          mechanism for building TAO successfully, so maybe this will be ok.

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * THANKS:
          Fix for running an IPv6 supporting build of ACE on a host
          that does not have IPV6 enabled. Thanks to Premkumar P <kumaran

Fri Aug  3 18:31:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Fixed a problem introduced with the revert below

Fri Aug  3 09:35:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Reverted the change to use a sleep of 50ms, the test stats show that
          some tests timeout without a real reason. Maybe the timeouts are now
          less reliable.

Fri Aug  3 01:50:05 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Enabled check_for_exception_spec.

Thu Aug  2 22:02:32 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp: Fixed to allow running the test against
          directories other than "../tests". Picks hardcoded TEST_DIR if
          compiled in (as previously) but will otherwise try $top_srcdir/tests,
          $ACE_ROOT/tests, or ../tests depending on env variables present.
          Allows the test to run in autoconf builds (fixes Bugzilla 1794).
          Also removed all the ACE_ASSERTs, replacing them with informative
          diagnostics.

Thu Aug  2 21:31:32 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

Thu Aug  2 20:24:22 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:

          No-thread builds, instances of ACE_TSS use their destructor
          instead of the static cleanup() method for deleting the object
          they point to. Adding a destructor specialization to enable
          non-ownership ACE_TSS behavior with no-thread builds for
          ACE_Service_Gestalt's.

Thu Aug  2 19:34:17 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

Thu Aug  2 09:22:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Use regular reinterpret_cast, use 0 instead of NULL and
          in case setspecific fails just do a printf, not an ACE_DEBUG
          because that will use ACE_Log_Msg again.

Wed Aug  1 21:39:04 UTC 2007  Dale Wilson  <wilsond@ociweb.com>

Wed Aug  1 18:55:12 UTC 2007  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/ConfigList.pm:
          Added '-Exclude <mask>' option to be able to finetune the actual
          tests being run without having to add yet another Config option
          and update the test .LST files.

        * ace/config-openvms.h:

Wed Aug  1 15:55:38 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:

          Added conditional compilation around template specification
          since ACE_TSS declares cleanup() only in multi-threaded builds.

Wed Aug  1 12:14:17 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

Wed Aug  1 07:39:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ace_wchar.h:
          Deprecated ACE_LIB_TEXT. Users can still use it, but not anymore
          in the code that is in the distribution

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          Moved the template specialization to the header file and made it
          "inline". This resolved linking problems with some compilers,
          which complained about either unresolved references or
          multiply-defined instances of cleanup(). Bugzilla 2980.

Tue Jul 31 18:48:25 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * ace/Auto_Functor.h:

          Zapped ACE_THROW_SPEC

          Guarded ACE_THROW_SPEC with ACE_LACKS_DEPRECATED_MACROS. The
          ACE_THROW_SPEC macro now has been deprecated.

          The above changes fix bugzilla 3008.

Tue Jul 31 15:02:34 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Multicast_Test_IPV6.cpp: Added some more diagnostic output and
          changed the enable-loopback sockopt from char to int to try and avoid
          some platform issues, particularly on Windows.

Tue Jul 31 14:45:35 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

Tue Jul 31 12:24:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Add attribute name to cleanup prototype, Borland C++ needs it,
          don't ask why

Tue Jul 31 12:07:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * m4/compiler.m4:

        * ace/os_include/os_dirent.h:
          Removed #undef rewinddir. It may have broken compilation

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.cpp:

          Use ACE_TCHAR instead of char to address problems in

Tue Jul 31 00:50:49 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:

          By introducing a partial specialization of
          ACE_TSS<ACE_Service_Config> we ensure that _if_ ACE_TSS::cleanup()
          is called before ~ACE_Object_Manager(), the TSS pointer will not
          clobber the ACE_Service_Config it points to. Resolves bugzilla
          2980. Thanks to Patrick Bennett <Patrick dot Bennett at inin dot
          com> and Lothar Werzinger <lothar at tradescape dot biz> for
          their input.

          to Hal Black <hal dot black at gmail dot com> for motivating this.

        * THANKS: Added Hal Black.

Mon Jul 30 22:50:40 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SOCK_Connector_Test.cpp: After rummaging through the hosts
          list looking for other names, do sethostent(0) before endhostent().
          Resolves the funky interaction with this and getaddrinfo() on AIX
          with IPv6 support which would, on the second lookup of the local
          host's name, return an AF_INET6 struct with an IPv4 address.
          Thanks to Phil Mesnier for co-laboring to work this little mess out.

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Client_Test.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Dump_Restore.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/createfile.cpp:
        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:

          Fixed ACE_OS fuzz warnings. Use ACE_OS calls instead of raw OS functions

        * netsvcs/clients/Tokens/manual/manual.cpp:

          Untabify.

Sat Jul 28 22:50:12 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SOCK_Connector_Test.cpp: Added some additional diagnostics

Sat Jul 28 21:58:27 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Process_Manual_Event_Test.cpp: Added a hack to always delete
          the underlying shared memory objects on AIX, primarily due to the
          inability to neatly clean these objects up after a failed test.
          See Bugzilla #2662 for further background. Also, added a delay
          in the child process to allow the parent to initialize the event
          objects. The race between the processes while the parent is
          initializing the event objects can cause the child to hang.
