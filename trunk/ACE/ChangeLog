        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU:
          Rearranged some rules so that C files are compiled with the
          C compiler on OpenVMS

Mon Mar  3 06:57:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ProcessVX.pm:
          Added support to specify a custom password for the iBoot

Sun Mar  2 20:04:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ProcessVX.pm:
          Integrated some OCI changes for the iBoot

Sun Mar  2 19:32:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Use ACE_ROOT as defailt root test directory instead of the current
          directory

          Use ACE_TMAIN instead of main as the program entry point to comply
          with ACE/TAO/CIAO coding standards.

        * examples/Mem_Map/IO-tests/Mem_Map_IO_Tests.mpc:

          MPC doesn't recognize ACE_TMAIN as an entry point, as such, we need
          to explicitly set exename in the MPC file.

          These files don't use ACE.

Sat Mar  1 19:09:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Added -r as option to specify an alternate root test directory
          instead of the current directory. Combined this with -l we can
          then run perl scripts for testing project code.

Thu Feb 28 16:08:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/generate_compile_stats.sh:
          Added --compiler as option so that we can specify a different
          compiler then gcc

Thu Feb 28 08:32:18 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/ACE-bug-process.html:
          Removed cvs

Wed Feb 27 19:28:18 UTC 2008  William Otte  <wotte@william-ottes-macbook-pro.local>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features:
          disable mcpp by default.

Tue Feb 26 15:52:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Added support for buildbits=64

Tue Feb 26 09:18:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          Added some compiler flags to reduce the number of warnings/errors
          in the OpenVMS builds

Mon Feb 25 19:44:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Win32.pm:
          Added IgnoreHostRoot which can be set from a test script. That way
          when doing cross host testing we can make sure we don't get the
          executable from the host root directory. This is for example usefull
          when we want to spawn perl or another system utility

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:
          Removed commented out line

Mon Feb 25 14:30:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.2.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxwork6.3.GNU:
          Added LD_PARTIALFLAGS which can be set for footprint builds

Mon Feb 25 08:13:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Set ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN when
          ACE_THR_FUNC_RETURN is an integral type

        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Use ACE_HAS_INTEGRAL_TYPE_THR_FUNC_RETURN to determine whether
          we can do a reinterpret_cast or static_cast. This is much easier
          then checking all compilers

Sun Feb 24 19:37:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Configuration.cpp:
        * ace/Configuration.h:

          Added new inline file

        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp:
          Prefix increment

        * ace/Event_Handler.h:
          Removed commented out code

Sat Feb 23 06:56:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openvms.GNU:
          OpenVMS doesn't have rwho

Fri Feb 22 18:55:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue_NT.h:
          Fixed wrong include

        * tests/Message_Queue_Test.cpp:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Moved ACE_Message_Queue_NT to its own file

Fri Feb 22 08:54:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/global.features:
          Default optimize_collocated_invocations to 1

Fri Feb 22 00:34:17 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst: Added !LabVIEW_RT to all tests that haven't
          been adapted to the non-local filesystem mechanism I invented to run
          tests for LabVIEW RT targets (and can also be used for other target
          types). Now I can enable TAO tests for the LabVIEW RT scoreboard
          build.

Thu Feb 21 15:25:37 UTC 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/Download.html:
          Updated download links to point to x.6.3

        * etc/index.html:
          Updated for x.6.3

Thu Feb 21 02:34:37 CST 2008  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>
