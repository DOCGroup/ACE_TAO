          Updated comment.

Wed Dec 27 09:24:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl (readdir_r):
          Simplified the OS checks in this method, use the new
          define ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_READDIR_R. This is then set in the
          config files below, maybe it has to be set in more, but the
          scoreboard will show that.

        * ace/config-aix-5.x.h:

        * ace/config-linux-common.h:

          This file isn't present with BlueCAT 4 Linux from LynuxWorks.

        * ace/config-posix.h:
          Layout changes

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
          Updated supported platforms by Remedy IT

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
          Use the ACE_NTOHL macro and remove the check for ACE_LACKS_NTOHL

        * ace/Map_Manager.{h,cpp}:
          Changed free_ to a real bool

        * ace/Name_Proxy.cpp:
        * ace/Name_Request_Reply.cpp:
        * ace/Time_Request_Reply.cpp
          Use the ACE_NTOHL macro so that this file compiles without networking
          support

Wed Dec 27 09:10:27 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Process.cpp:
          Changed to use ACE_LACKS_VSNPRINTF instead of ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF.

Tue Dec 26 22:47:57 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp: Reverted the changes to ACE_OS::argv_to_string()
          from here:

          Sun Dec 24 22:29:24 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

          so that Signal_Test.cpp tests don't break.  In a nutshell, each
          argv[i] argument to ACE_ARGV is not supposed to be quoted.
          Thanks to Steve Huston for reporting this.

Tue Dec 26 22:46:34 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/ARGV_Test.cpp (run_main): Updated the test to test how the
          conversion from char *argv[] to a char * works.

Mon Dec 25 16:19:42 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * Merry Christmas everyone!!!

Sun Dec 24 23:13:37 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/ARGV_Test.cpp: Updated the test to ensure that Pavel's
          patches work properly.

Sun Dec 24 22:29:24 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.inl,
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp: Modified ACE_OS::strenvdup() and
          ACE_OS::argv_to_string() so they split the arguments containing
          spaces in accordance with the documentation.  Thanks to Pavel
          Zaichenko <zpf at ivl dot ua> for these patches.

Fri Dec 22 17:35:53 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:

          Add a __NetBSD__ to the preprocessor conditional to select the
          three argument version of readdir_r.  While this what was done
          for FreeBSD, HPUX, etc., it really points out a need for a new
          feature test macro.

        * ace/config-netbsd.h:

          Only define thread-related feature test macros if ACE_MT_SAFE is
          defined (with a non-zero value).

Fri Dec 22 13:56:15 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/http_heders.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/http_status.cpp: Specify type and class separately
          for each static member instance to allow HP aC++ 03.* (PA-RISC
          compiler) to grok it. At least the Itanium compilers could handle
          this... there's hope.

Fri Dec 22 12:52:05 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:
          Build shared libs by default.

Fri Dec 22 09:31:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Service_Manager.h:
          Improved doxygen documentation, thanks to Stefan Naewe
          <stefan at naewe dot de> for delivering the patch

Thu Dec 21 21:54:51 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h: Added support for SCTP in FreeBSD version
          700028 and greater.  Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <rodrigc at
          crodrigues dot org> for reporting this.

Thu Dec 21 20:19:04 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Use prefix increment and made get_interfaces working with rtems

Thu Dec 21 16:12:16 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Fixing the condition for running the Transport::Current tests
          (note that ST = Single Threaded, not STATIC).

Thu Dec 21 14:31:04 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Added support for get_interfaces for rtems

Thu Dec 21 13:32:08 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:
          Moved macro definitions from CFLAGS to CPPFLAGS.

Thu Dec 21 12:12:04 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:
          Removed old chorus rules

Thu Dec 21 10:17:04 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:
          Fixed initialisation warning

Thu Dec 21 09:45:00 UTC 2006  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * ace/OS_TLI.inl:
        * ace/OS_NS_signal.h:

          Updated some HPUX Acc version bug fixes.....

Thu Dec 21 08:47:04 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS2/HPPTU/http_headers.{h,inl}:
          Fixed const warnings with Intel C++

Wed Dec 20 22:06:14 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          HP-UX has broken vsnprintf function. Changed the test not
          to fail on HP-UX.

Wed Dec 20 16:35:53 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

          These are fixes correcting scoreboard issues pertaining to the
          checkin from Tue Dec 19 22:09:34 UTC 2006.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added the two Transport::Current tests to the scoreboard.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/tc.mpb:

          Moved this file to $TAO_ROOT/MPC/config where it belongs.

Wed Dec 20 12:31:04 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/test_config.h:
          Only define ACE_START_TEST and ACE_END_TEST when they are not
          defined yet. This way we can set our own define in the config.h
          file and for example just do logging to stdout instead of a file
          which can be problematic when the test target doesn't have a
          file system

Wed Dec 20 04:52:04 UTC 2006  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
        * docs/Download.html:

          Fleshed out SVN instructions a bit more, corrected link mistake in
          Download.html.

          Thanks to Craig Rodrigues <rodrigc at crodrigues dot org> for the patch.

Tue Dec 19 22:09:34 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/tc.mpb:

          Added a new project type for projects using the Transport
          Current functionality.

Tue Dec 19 20:05:42 UTC 2006  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/Download.html:
          Added link to SVN documentation.

Tue Dec 19 14:19:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_rtems.x_g++.GNU:
          Set load address

Tue Dec 19 14:18:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Object_Manager_Base.cpp (print_error_message):
          Fixed invalid filename

Tue Dec 19 13:16:38 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log.cpp (log): Changed the loop iterator to
          be size_t rather than long to silence a warning about comparing
          signed and unsigned values.  Thanks to Johnny for reporting
          this.

Tue Dec 19 09:11:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (readdir_r):
          Refactored this method to make it easier to maintain and at the
          same moment fixed compile error when building ACE on VxWorks 6.4
          in kernel mode without pthread support

Mon Dec 18 22:28:48 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log.cpp (log): Iterate for i <
          log_record.msg_data_len() rather than i < log_record.length ()
          to avoid nasty overrun errors.  Thanks to Paxton Mason <PMason
          at wolve dot com> for reporting this.  This fixes bugid 2754.

Mon Dec 18 22:28:18 UTC 2006  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Record.h: Clarify the meaning of length() in the
          comments.  Thanks to Paxton Mason <PMason at wolve dot com> for
          motivating this.

Mon Dec 18 13:48:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACEXML/common/common.mpc:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/configs/acexml.mpb:
          Added zzip as base, this project really uses zzip

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/configs/acedefaults.mpb:
          Removed zzip and zlib as base projects. Any project that uses
          zzip or zlib should derive from the correct project, but not
          acedefaults. When making them a base from acedefaults any
          project links with zzip/zlib even when they don't use it.

          This fixes bugzilla bug 2751.

Mon Dec 18 10:59:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/parse_url.h:
          Added prefix to the members of the URL_ERROR enum, NONE is a macro
          on some platforms like VxWorks

Mon Dec 18 10:04:19 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Do not execute snprintf test if ACE_LACKS_VSNPRINTF is defined.

Fri Dec 15 23:09:29 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Makefile.am: Removed JAWS.h; see
          Thu Dec 14 21:08:19 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Fri Dec 15 15:03:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks6.3.GNU:

          Added support for VxWorks 6.4

Thu Dec 14 21:08:19 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/jaws2.mpc: Corrected compiler defines to add
          JAWS_BUILD_DLL, not replace previous.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Export.h: Replaced contents with new content
          generated from generate_export_file.pl. Previous content was
          generated from GenerateExportH.BAT and was missing lots of
          stuff, some of which prevented generation of .lib, .exp files.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/JAWS.h: Removed; it only had JAWS_TRACE defined
          which is properly defined in Export.h now.

        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Pipeline_Tasks.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/IO_Handler.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/IO.cpp:
        * apps/JAWS2/JAWS/Concurrency.cpp: Removed #include "JAWS/JAWS.h"

Thu Dec 14 12:36:43 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-qnx-neutrino.h:
          Added several missing defines to build with QNX

Thu Dec 14 11:57:43 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_qnx_neutrino.GNU:
          Set all tools using ?= so that we can override the name
          from the platform_macros.GNU file

Thu Dec 14 00:12:49 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (event_init): Solaris's shm_open() requires a
          single '/' on the name argument. I opted to put that logic here
          rather than the lower-level ACE_OS::shm_open(), but that point
          is debatable. In any case, look for a leading / on the name if
          ACE_SHM_OPEN_REQUIRES_ONE_SLASH is defined; if it's not there,
          add it.

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h: Added ACE_SHM_OPEN_REQUIRES_ONE_SLASH.

        * ace/README: Add description of ACE_SHM_OPEN_REQUIRES_ONE_SLASH.

        * configure.ac: Added check for ACE_SHM_OPEN_REQUIRES_ONE_SLASH.
          Fixed check for ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS to display the findings
          when configuring.

        * m4/config_h.m4: Added ACE_SHM_OPEN_REQUIRES_ONE_SLASH and
          ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS.

Wed Dec 13 15:04:57 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Updated the configuration for ORB_Local_Config/Bug_2612 to
          require a multithreaded build to reflect the design goals of the
          test.

Tue Dec 12 23:50:43 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * NEWS:

          Document --enable-ace-reactor-notification-queue.

        * m4/ace.m4:

          Add autoconf support for --enable-ace-reactor-notification-queue.
          Configuring with this option sets ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE
          in config.h.

Wed Dec 13 01:41:19 UTC 2006  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * ace/UUID.cpp:

          Fixed a potential memory leak. Dynamic memory was allocated but
          not freed under special circumstances. For details, check BUGID
          2746. This closes BUGID 2746.

Tue Dec 12 22:38:06 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/parse_url.h: Made the char* members const to
          resolve compile warnings about assignment of char* literals.

Tue Dec 12 19:54:05 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/httpu.mpc: Must build HTTPU after JAWS2.

Tue Dec 12 19:54:04 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Changed the regular expression to recognize #include's of files
          with double quotes within a version block.

Tue Dec 12 19:31:39 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:

          Corrected a bug where a non-ACE/TAO/CIAO file included within a
          version block was being marked as an error.

Tue Dec 12 17:01:42 UTC 2006  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/MPC.cfg:

          Added $DDS_ROOT/MPC/config to the includes, since the
          .mpb files in DDS have been moved to this location, making
          them consistent with the location of similar files in
          TAO and CIAO.

Tue Dec 12 15:08:32 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

          Sergey for this.

        * apps/JAWS2/HTTPU/http_base.cpp (receive): Made this work with
          HTTPU.  Thanks to Sergey Kosenko <sergey dot kosenko at gmail
          dot com> for these patches.

Mon Dec 11 20:21:14 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.{h cpp} (ACE_OutputCDR): Added a new method, int
          consolidate (void) which consolidates any continuation message
          blocks into the start block, ensuring that all data is located
          in one block on return. This is useful for situations which
          require the entire encoded stream to be available in one buffer,
          regardless of length.

        * tests/CDR_Test.cpp: Added a test for consolidate().

        * NEWS: Added notice for new consolidate() method.

        Thanks to Howard Finer <hfiner at sonusnet dot com> for supplying
        the new ACE_OutputCDR::consolidate() method.

Mon Dec 11 20:03:04 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Changed the template to use the words "make macros" instead of
          features.  There may have be some confusion with MPC features.

Mon Dec 11 17:39:46 UTC 2006  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * docs/ace_guidelines.vsmacros:

          Fixed macros specification so the same file can be used
          with both VS.NET 2003 and VS.NET 2005 development
          environments.

Mon Dec 11 15:23:08 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/MPC.cfg:
        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Removed the code that specifically added the gnuace and borland
          project types and rely on the dynamic_types directive in the
          MPC.cfg to have the MPC core add them.

Sat Dec  9 19:13:52 UTC 2006  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

Fri Dec  8 20:20:09 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (parse_args_i):

          Moving the "default:" label outside the block that handles the
          "case 's':". Even though it should work correctly on allmost any
          compiler, things like this are bad form. Thanks to Aaron
          Scamehorn <Aaron dot Scamehorn at cogcap dot com> for noticing.

Fri Dec  8 16:39:51 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Null_Mutex.h: Added ACE_Export to the class declarations.
          Although they are probably inlined, VS .NET 2005 (VC8) complains
          in some cases when a dll-interface class inherits from a
          non-dll-interface class.

          more resilient to leading whitespace like was added by a bug in
          the release script in the last beta.  Thanks to Ray Lischner
          <rlischner at proteus-technologies dot com> for this patch.

Mon Dec  4 23:13:12 UTC 2006  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp (init_i):

          Fixed bug#2735 and eliminated a potential memory leak of the
          list of already processed static services. The failure scenario
          is based on a case where static initializers register a bunch of
          service objects and then later the gestalt::open() is called. At
          that point, the abovementioned list is reinitialized and its
          contents was lost. See also the other failure scenario
          (bug#2701) for which a fix was put in on Nov 9 2006.

          The 'result' pointer is invalid upon return from post_completion()

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/ace_for_tao.mpb:

        * ace/config-win32-msvc.h:
        * ace/OS_Memory.h:
          The MFC new/exception code needed the ability to delete a caught
          CMemoryException object to prevent memory leaks (see
          http://msdn2.microsoft.com/de-de/library/0e5twxsh(VS.80).aspx).
          This necessitates that every platform other than Windows/MFC gets
          an empty define for ACE_del_bad_alloc, and the ACE_NEW... macros
          have ACE_del_bad_alloc expanded in the catch block.
          For past history of this issue, see the trail starting at:

        Thu Nov 16 16:14:32 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.{h inl}: Added a capacity() method that returns
          the number of allocated CHAR units in the string object. Thanks to
          Kelly Hickel <kfh at mqsoftware dot com> for supplying this.

        * NEWS: Updated with recent ACE_String_Base and build additions.

        Mon Nov 13 17:40:58 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.{h cpp}: Added a fast_resize(size_t) method to
          manage the sizing/reallocating of the string, but doesn't do the
          memory setting of resize(). Changed resize() to call fast_resize()
          then do the memory setting.
          Thank you to Kelly Hickel <kfh at mqsoftware dot com> for these
          additions.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: For creating the object file
          directories (e.g., VDIR and VSHDIR, and their subdirectories), change
          from using the directory as a prerequisite and make that prereq
          a PHONY target to embed the command(s) to check and create the
          directory if needed. This accomplishes two things: 1) allows the
          make to work with clearmake in GNU compatibility mode (clearmake
          always saw the PHONY target as remade and remade every file in the
          project), and 2) avoids using a PHONY target as a prerequisite,
          something the GNU make manual says to avoid. Thank you to Howard
          Finer <hfiner at sonusnet dot com> for motivating and assisting
          in this effort.

        Tue Nov 14 22:33:03 UTC 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU: Change VLOBJS and VSHOBJS to
          use $(patsubst) instead of $(if) to look for entries that have
          relative directories in them (../). Avoids $(if) which does not
          work in Clearcase's clearmake GNU compatibility mode.

Wed Nov 22 19:52:23 UTC 2006  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:
          Add uuid as base project. For building COIOP as part of the
          TAO strategies library we need uuid. The nicest solution would
          be to make the uuid feature dependent on the ace_for_tao
          feature and let the user overrule this but that is not
          possible yet. If you are using ace_for_tao and don't want
          to have uuid pulled in, set uuid explicitly to 0 in your
          default.features file.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Refactored handling of %W. Added a check for a nill pointer
          as we have for ascii strings. Fixes bugzilla 2277.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:
          Added test for %W with a string as argument and with a
          nill pointer. Fixes bugzilla 2715.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core_anytypecode.mpb:
          Removed svn:executable property

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core_strategies.mpb
          New base project for the strategies library when build in
          ace_for_tao configuration

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:
          Removed -GT so that we also don't generate TIE files for the
          orbsvcs anymore. Will speedup builds and simplify other mpc
          files

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/strategies.mpb
          Derive from core_strategies. Now the strategies library
          does get build in an ace_for_tao configuration but
          shmiop and uiop are not build at all, other protocols
          can be build. This way we can build COIOP in an ace_for_tao
          setup

        * bin/make_release:
          Removed dsp/dsw reference, corrected naming of the ACE
          packages when the version number gets added.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Removed HPUX 10.20 support

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:
          ACE_HAS_BROKEN_THREAD_KEYFREE is now set in the config file

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Removed ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 checks

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp:
          Added ACE_HAS_SIGVAL_SIGVAL_INT, this fixes bugzilla
          bug 2716. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues
          <rodrigc at crodrigues dot org> for reporting this.

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Added missing OS.inl. This fixes bugzilla bug 2705.
          Thanks to Daniel Black <dragonheart at gentoo dot org>
          for reporting this.

        * Release:
          Removed dsw files

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
        * ace/config-posix-nonetworking.h:
          Moved the configuration to build without no networking
          support to its own file so that we can reuse this for
          example on linux

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Added support for rtems 4.7

        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h:
          Cleanup

        * ace/config-lyxos.h:
          Added support for LynxOS 4.2

        * ace/config-linux.h:
        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
          Moved ACE_HAS_GETIFADDRS to the common file and added
          support for ACE_LACKS_NETWORKING on linux

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp
          Fixed compile problem when using ACE_LACKS_NETWORKING on
          linux

        * ace/Obstack.h:
          Use ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARATION to resolve link errors
          on FC6. Thanks to Ken Sedgwick <ken at bonsai dot com> for
          reporting this and testing out the patch.

        * ace/OS_NS_string.inl:
          Initialise pointer with 0
