        * tests/INET_Addr_Test.cpp:
          Add test for ACE_INET_Addr::is_loopback () API. This tests a
          selected set of addresses to validate API's conformance with RFC
          3330.

Tue Mar  6 13:21:24 UTC 2007  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * COPYING: Updated this file to clarify that the ACE license need
          not be shipped with binary-only releases.  Thanks to Michael
          Kircher <michael dot kircher at siemens dot com> and Werner
          Burger <werner dot burger at siemens dot com> for motivating
          this.

Tue Mar  6 12:43:01 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Date_Time_Test.cpp:

          Handle the rare case where the minute rolls over during the test.

Tue Mar  6 04:41:36 UTC 2007  Abdullah Sowayan  <abdullah.sowayan@lmco.com>

        * examples/DLL/README:

          README was referring to files (dsp/dsw) used by Visual Studio C++ 6.
          Updated to refer to files (sln/vcproj) used by VC++ 7.1 or later.

Tue Mar  6 02:37:53 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdeesk.com>

        * Merged changes from the fix_bug_2820 branch.  From revision
          77533 to revision 77546.

        Tue Mar  6 02:07:43 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdeesk.com>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          Fixed bugs in loop to extract event handlers from notification
          pipe.

        * tests/Bug_2820_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Fixed several problems in the test:
          - The Event_Handler called on the Reactor on its destructor, but
            by then the reactor was already destroyed.
          - Improved debugging messages.
          - Fixed memory management problems, valgrind is happy now.

        Mon Mar  5 18:01:36 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * ace/Notification_Queue.cpp:
          When deleting the queue we must decrease the reference count on
          all the event handlers stored there.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          When the notification pipe is destroyed we must read the data
          stored there and release all the event handlers.  Otherwise the
          reference counts are broken.

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Add Bug_2820_Regression_Test to the list.

        Mon Mar  5 17:16:16 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * tests/Bug_2820_Regression_Test.cpp:
          The test was broken, it did not delete the Reactor, so it failed
          to test what we wanted.

Tue Mar  6 00:10:36 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/event_server.cpp: Use ACE_DEBUG
          to display the message containing a time_t. Use of the standard
          iostream operator<< with time_t gives the Intel90 compiler fits.

Mon Mar  5 23:09:59 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.{h cpp}: Added new format specifiers:
          %b to format ssize_t values
          %B to format size_t values
          %: to format time_t values

          Note that these use, when necessary, printf format specifiers such
          as ACE_SIZE_T_FORMAT_SPECIFIER and ACE_INT64_FORMAT_SPECIFIER.
          The printf formatters can't be used portably in ACE_Log_Msg format
          strings because 1) some of them use %I, which has a different meaning
          in ACE_Log_Msg already and 2) some of the new printf formats are
          more complicated that ACE_Log_Msg knows how to deal with in its
          existing logic to use format modifiers. The new ACE_Log_Msg format
          specifiers make it easy to portably log these types that can change
          sizes across platforms.

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp (dump):
        * tests/Cached_Allocator_Test.cpp:
        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp: Use the new ACE_Log_Msg format
          specifiers for size_t and time_t logged values.

Mon Mar  5 22:23:01 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/clean_sems.sh:

          s/xargs/xargs -r/  The -r switch to xargs prevents the command from
          being executed when there are no arguments.  This will prevent the
          extra scoreboard output on Linux (when rem_sems is used):
            usage: ipcrm [ [-q msqid] [-m shmid] [-s semid]
            [-Q msgkey] [-M shmkey] [-S semkey] ... ]
            deprecated usage: ipcrm {shm | msg | sem} id ...

Mon Mar  5 18:02:42 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h (ACE_UINT64_MAX):

          Simplified preprocessor conditionals.

        * ace/RB_Tree.h (ACE_RB_Tree_Iterator_Base):

          Made copy constructor public instead of private.  The assignment
          operator was already public so there was nothing to be gained by
          making the copy constructor protected.  Addresses Sun Studio 10
          warnings.

        * ace/Time_Value.inl (to_usec):

          Added support for ACE_LACKS_UNSIGNEDLONGLONG_T case.

        * ace/UUID.cpp (get_systemtime):

          In the ACE_LACKS_UNSIGNEDLONGLONG_T case, wrap 64-bit integer
          constant with ACE_INT64_LITERAL macro.  Addresses potential
          problem where the constant is intepreted as a "long", instead of
          "long long".

Mon Mar  5 17:22:26 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.inl:
        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/QoS/SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_QoS.cpp:
          RFC 3330 defines loopback as any address with 127.x.x.x. The
          is_loopback API currently simply compares against the
          INADDR_LOOPBACK macro. Doing so restricts loopback definition to
          127.0.0.1 which is inconsistent with the RFC definition. This
          change will include any address with 127.x.x.x as loopback.

Mon Mar  5 14:16:49 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Updated for LynxOS.

Mon Mar 5 11:25:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Enabled ACE_HAS_VSFWPRINTF for aCC compiler

Mon Mar 5 09:21:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op_Sparc.c:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.{h,cpp}:
          Added optimized functions for SunCC on x86. Thanks to
          Dennis Chernoivanov <cdi at tbricks dot com> for reporting this.
          If you want to enable these, add atomic_ops_sparc=1 to your
          platform_macros.GNU file

Sat Mar  3 17:35:52 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h (ACE_UINT64_MAX):

          Re-wrap the integer constant with the ACE_UINT64_LITERAL macro
          to ensure the appropriate type specifier is used.

Fri Mar  3 5:01:19 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h (ACE_UINT64_MAX):

          Reintroduced this constant for the case where 64 bit integers
          are natively supported.  It was inadvertently removed.

          Removed stray semi-colon in ACE_LACKS_{UNSIGNED}LONGLONG_T
          case.

Fri Mar  2 21:42:54 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h (ACE_UINT64_MAX):

          Corrected value for the ACE_LACKS_{UNSIGNED}LONG_LONG_T case.

          (ACE_U64_TO_U32, ACE_CU64_TO_CU32):

          Converted these macros to inlined functions.

          (ACE_LONGLONG_TO_PTR):

          Cast pointer to intptr_t instead of ptrdiff_t before casting
          to the pointer type.  The ptrdiff_t type  is meant for pointer
          differences.

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp (dump):

          Drop ACE_CU64_TO_CU32 macro in favor of standard static_cast<>.
          There was no real use for that macro in this case.

        * ace/Numeric_Limits.h (ACE_Numeric_Limits):

          Added a specialization for ACE_U_LongLong.

        * ace/Sample_History.cpp (dump_samples):

          Removed unnecessary cast to 32 bit value.

          Corrected Log_Msg format specifier for unsigned type.

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp (operator*=):
        * tests/Time_Value_Test.cpp (run_main):

          Removed ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS preprocessor conditional.  Use
          ACE_Numeric_Limits<> instead.  It is always available.

        * ace/Time_Value.h (to_usec):
        * ace/Time_Value.inl (to_usec):

          Enabled support for this method when ACE_LACKS_LONGLONG_T is
          defined.

        * ace/UUID.cpp (get_systemtime):

          Fixed support for ACE_U_LongLong type.

Fri Mar  2 20:48:45 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Improved the description of using Pharlap ETS and
          described the ACE_PHARLAP_TESTLOG_TO_FILE config setting.

        * ace/config-pharlap.h: Add a IN_CLASSD(i) macro that always reports
          false. Although Pharlap is supposed to support multicast, the
          IN_CLASSD macro is only added at WinSock 2.

        * tests/Test_Output.cpp: Allow Pharlap to log to a file by setting
          ACE_PHARLAP_TESTLOG_TO_FILE in config.h. The default behavior of
          logging to the system console still stands.

Fri Mar  2 18:18:25 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Override the targets method to supply a list of targets that can
          be used with Eclipse.

Fri Mar  2 17:48:09 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Truncate.h (Truncator):

          Fixed one more typo in the ACE_U_LongLong partial specialization
          of this functor.  Also corrected truncation logic.

Thu Mar  1 16:30:13 UTC 2007  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.h (ACE_Log_Msg): Updated the document to remove the
          claim that stdout can be used.  Thanks to Ian C White
          <Ian_C_White at raytheon dot com> for reporting this.

Thu Mar 1 13:15:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Removed ACE_HAS_VSWPRINTF, there are dependencies on this
          define and no time to handle this fully.

Thu Mar 1 12:28:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Fixed sun warning

Thu Mar 1 12:18:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Reactor/Misc/test_signals_2.cpp:
          Removed HPUX disabling, compiles fine on our system

Thu Mar 1 9:42:12 UTC 2007  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/PerlACE/Process_Unix.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Unix.pm:
          Some fixes for running VxWorks 6.x RTP tests.

Thu Mar  1 08:51:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.{cpp,inl}:
          Introduced new ACE_HAS_VSWPRINTF that we can set when a platform
          has this method

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Added ACE_HAS_VSWPRINTF

Wed Feb 28 21:34:45 UTC 2007  Wallace Zhang  <zhang_w@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added two new TAO tests.

Wed Feb 28 19:16:12 UTC 2007  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:
        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
          Fixed pointer conversion warnings on OpenVMS.

Wed Feb 28 17:44:20 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Truncate.h (Truncator):

          Fixed typo in the ACE_LACKS_UNSIGNEDLONGLONG_T case.
          s/ACE_UIN32/ACE_UINT32/.

Wed Feb 28 13:32:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
          Moved ACE_HAS_SSIZE_T outside of the compiler specific part, gcc
          and aCC do have ssize_t. Also moved ACE_HAS_XPG4_MULTIBYTE_CHAR
          outside of the compiler part.

Wed Feb 28 11:09:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.cpp (num_processors):
          Implemented for HPUX

Wed Feb 28 09:58:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ADDIDL.DSM:
          Moved to TAO

        * bin/msvc_cidlc.pl:
          Moved to CIAO

        * indent_macros.perl:
        * indent_macros.pl:
          Renamed extension to .pl

Wed Feb 28 09:44:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/corba-boolean.perl:
        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:
        * bin/subst_env.pl:
        * bin/tao_env.pl:
        * bin/tao_svcconf.pl:
          Moved to TAO/bin, no need to ship these with ACE

Wed Feb 28 08:14:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp:
          Fixed a deadlock that could occur when a dll is loaded which itselfs
          also loads a dll in its static initialisation. This fixes bugzilla bug
          2830.

Tue Feb 27 21:18:07 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Time_Request_Reply.cpp:
        * tests/Integer_Truncate_Test.cpp:
        * tests/CDR_File_Test.cpp:

          s/ACE_Utils::Truncate/ACE_Utils::truncate_cast/g.  The former is
          deprecated.

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp:

          Improved variable types to make use of
          ACE_Utils::truncate_cast<> unnecessary.

Tue Feb 27 18:55:12 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          The intent of the change is to better detect (and be able to
          recover from) a situation when memory allocation fails in
          constructing or initializing an ACE_Data_Block. It fixes a
          problem with the change from "Mon Feb 26 19:06:36 UTC 2007"
          which wasn't accounting for the new datablock size correctly.

Tue Feb 27 19:33:13 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Truncate.h:

          Added specializations for ACE_U_LongLong.

          Added yet another const specialization for BCB6 to work around
          its inability to use valid specializations with template
          parameters that are not const.

          Removed ACE_Utils::Truncate<> altogether.  Use
          ACE_Utils::truncate_cast<> instead.

Tue Feb 27 15:18:50 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/docs/templates/gnu.txt:

          Added documentation for template variables used by the gnuace
          project type.  This is used by document_template.pl found in
          MPC/devtools.

Tue Feb 27 14:59:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Process_Manager_Test.cpp:
          Fixed incorrect initialized variable

Tue Feb 27 14:20:26 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          Reverting my patch from "Mon Feb 26 19:06:36 UTC 2007". It needs
          more work.

Tue Feb 27 13:57:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp:
        * ace/DLL_Test.cpp:
          Removed check for KCC, that compiler is not supported anymore

Tue Feb 27 11:45:06 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * tests/Notification_Queue_Unit_Test.cpp:
          Fixed compilation error in Redhat_Enterprise_Linux_3_Debug_WChar
          build.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for letting me know.

Tue Feb 27 03:34:40 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * tests/Notification_Queue_Unit_Test.cpp:
          Use functions instead of macros to workaround compiler warnings
          in the HP-UX_11iv2_IA64_aCC_wchar build.
          The warnings were harmless, but the code is more readable this
          way in any case.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for bringing the
          warnings to my attention.

Mon Feb 26 20:58:05 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp (insert):

          Removed the usage of fprintf to print messages about service
          descriptors, inserted using static initializers. It is the only
          way if you want to see what is being inserted before ACE_Log_Msg
          gets initialized but because it uses stderr directly, it may
          affect some aplications' expected output.

        * ace/Service_Repository.cpp (insert):

          Fixing a defective debug statement.

Mon Feb 26 19:06:36 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (grow_and_adjust, clone_nocopy):

          For large sizes the message block constructor may fail to
          allocate and/or initialize the necessary ACE_Data_Block
          instances. The failure to initialize can go unnoticed and may
          cause an unlimited number of recursive invocations of
          grow_and_adjust. The change adds a test for the invariant of the
          newly allocated ACE_Message_Block instance.

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp (clone_nocopy):

          When memory is scarce the allocation of ACE_Data_Block may
          succeed while the initialization can fail.  Adding a test,
          before the message block is declared good.

Mon Feb 26 17:17:08 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/PerlACE/Run_Test.pm:

          Set up the $PerlACE::CIAO_ROOT variable, just like $PerlACE::TAO_ROOT
          except for CIAO.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          Find CIAO tests relative to the $CIAO_ROOT directory.

Mon Feb 26 13:56:42 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ACETAOCIAO.style:
          Updated to version 1.12 of StyleManager

Mon Feb 26 13:03:19 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:

          Added code to surround all libraries with a -Wl,--start-group and
          -Wl,--end-group only if the compiler is g++, we're linking static
          libraries, it's an executable and the 'link_groups' template
          variable is set.

Mon Feb 26 10:08:19 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * tests/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast_Test.cpp:
          Pass correct buffer length to ACE_OS::vsnprintf().
          Thanks to Yves Alloyer <alloyer at ipanematech dot com> for
          reporting this and providing initial patch.

Mon Feb 26 08:50:13 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Process.cpp (command_line):
          Pass correct buffer length to ACE_OS::vsnprintf().
          Thanks to Yves Alloyer <alloyer at ipanematech dot com> for
          reporting this and providing initial patch.

Sun Feb 25 17:26:37 UTC 2007  Jaiganesh B  <jai.dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added the DiffServ policy test's run_test.pl.

Sat Feb 24 23:01:16 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configure.ac: Added ACE_CHECK_LACKS_FUNCS(alphasort)

Sat Feb 24 22:51:09 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-sunos5.5.h:
        * ace/config-sunos5.10.h: Add ACE_LACKS_ALPHASORT at Solaris 2.5 and
          remove it at Solaris 10. Solaris 8 and 9 have an alphasort() but
          only for use with the BSD cc compiler and with disclaimer that it's
          not supported for use with system libraries nor with multiple
          threads. Solaris 10 brings it into supported use.

Sat Feb 24 17:03:47 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/NT_Service/main.cpp:
        * examples/NT_Service/nt_svc.{h cpp}: Don't check for disabling
          macros until a config file has been included, else it never builds
          anywhere. Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for pointing this out.

Sat Feb 24 09:01:19 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/config-linux.h:

          AIO support pulls in the rt library, which pulls in the pthread
          library.  Disable AIO in single-threaded builds.

        * tests/Recursive_Mutex_Test.cpp:

          Check if ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex::get_nesting_level() is
          supported before attempting to use it.

Sat Feb 24 08:34:08 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-openvms.h:
        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h:
        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-pre62x.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ALPHASORT.

Fri Feb 23 23:10:17 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * tests/Recursive_Mutex_Test.cpp (test_recursion_depth):

          Issue error messages instead of assert()ing.  VxWorks builds
          will hang on a crash.  Thanks to Johnny for pointing this out.

Fri Feb 23 19:24:30 USMST 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/SCTP/SOCK_SEQPACK_srv.cpp:

          Made run_server() and other functions and structures only compiled
          when ACE_HAS_SCTP is defined. This should resolve the warning that the
          run_server() is defined but not used on some platforms.

Fri Feb 23 17:47:28 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * tests/Bug_2815_Regression_Test.cpp:
          The test should be enabled only if the notification queue is
          also enabled.  Basically purge_pending_notifications() is not
          supported without the notification queue, and that is the
          operation we want to test.

Fri Feb 23 15:37:03 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl (alphasort): Use a bigger hammer on the casts.

Fri Feb 23 10:50:41 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:
          Fixed casts again. Hopefully now I got it right.

Fri Feb 23 08:56:15 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:
          Added casts to fix compile errors.

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.2.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.3.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks6.4.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ALPHASORT.

Thu Feb 22 18:37:00 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.inl:
        * ace/Service_Config.cpp:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:
        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Fixing build troubles caused by the different ACE_TSS interface
          for single-threaded builds. Eliminated the intermediary class
          (TSS_Resources) and now storing the actual service gestalt
          pointer in TSS, thus reducig the memory allocation overhead.

Thu Feb 22 16:45:30 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/MT_SOCK_Test.cpp: Document the actual cause of what's been
          observed for some time with some Windows systems exhibiting a
          "delayed rejection" of connections in excess of the listener's
          backlog. Thank you to Aleksandar Vukajlovic <vukajlo at finsoft
          dot co dot yu> for citing the full cause with its supporting
          documentation and explanation.

Thu Feb 22 15:59:12 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Change the comments around ACE_HAS_PENTIUM
          to more accurately reflect its use and setting. With the switch to
          QueryPerformanceCounter() for high-res timers on Windows, this
          setting doesn't have any affect on timers, but it is used in
          some CDR operations. This resolves Bugzilla #1410.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.inl (gethrtime):
        * ace/gethrtime.cpp: Remove the comments directing the reader to a
          description of using RDTSC on Windows. The comment is long gone, and
          RDTSC isn't used on Windows/VC any longer anyway.

Thu Feb 22 15:07:22 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/modules/GNUACEProjectCreator.pm:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd:
          Additions to support DDS specific build rules and versioning.

Thu Feb 22 13:56:42 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added Notification_Queue.{h,cpp,inl}:

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:
          Added include when ACE_LACKS_ALPHASORT is defined

Thu Feb 22 13:03:01 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * Merged changes from the bug_2815 branch.  From revision 77182 to
          revision 77315.

        Tue Feb 20 18:17:00 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:
          Add Notification_Queue.cpp to this file too.  Thanks to Johnny
          Willemsen for pointing this out.

          Mon Feb 19 21:53:58 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * ace/Intrusive_List.inl:
          I learned a minute ago that std::swap() was kosher.  Use it in
          favor of ACE_Swap<>.

          Mon Feb 19 21:47:48 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/Bug_2815_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Adjusted the number of iterations so the test would pass on my
          G4-based laptop without optimizations or inlining.  The previous
          numbers were just guesses anyway and I hope the new numbers will
          result in no failures for the scoreboard.

          Mon Feb 19 21:29:32 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * ace/Notification_Queue.cpp:
          Modified the purging algorithm.  The algorithm used a temporary
          list to store the elements not purged, so basically all nodes
          were either moved to the free list or to the temporary list.
          The new algorithm only removes the nodes that needs purging.
          In the vast majority of the cases this is more efficient because
          most nodes are not purged.
          This resulted in a factor of 2 improvement for
          tests/Bug_2815_Regression_Test, keep in mind that in this
          program 1/16th of the nodes are purged.  So in practice I would
          expect even better results.
          I also changed the order in which the free nodes are re-used, I
          think LIFO order has a better chance of re-using the cache, but
          I have no evidence or experiments to prove this.

        * ace/Intrusive_List.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_List.cpp:
          Renamed the remove_i() function to unsafe_remove() and promoted
          its access to "public".  The function is not safe to use in
          general, thus the name, but it resulted in a factor of 2
          performance improvement for ACE_Notification_Queue.

        * tests/Bug_2815_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Fixed memory leaks (in the test not the library)

          Mon Feb 19 20:32:34 UTC 2007  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * ace/Notification_Queue.h:
        * ace/Notification_Queue.inl:
        * ace/Notification_Queue.cpp:
          Re-factored to use ACE_Intrusive_List in the implementation.
          This eliminates memory allocations during additions and removal
          of elements.  Also, many of the operations cannot fail, so the
          code became smaller.

        * ace/Intrusive_List.h:
        * ace/Intrusive_List.inl:
          Add a swap() member function.

          Mon Feb 19 04:49:35 UTC 2007  coryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * ace/Notification_Queue.h:
        * ace/Notification_Queue.cpp:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
          New class to encapsulate the implementation of a user-space
          based notification queue.  The code was duplicated in both
          Select_Reactor.{h,cpp} and Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h,cpp}

        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
        * tests/Notification_Queue_Unit_Test.cpp:
          New unit test for the notification queue class.

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.h:
        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
          Refactored notification queue code to a new class
          (ACE_Notification_Queue)

        * tests/Bug_2815_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Add code to help with debugging.  Basically my refactoring above
          had at least one bug, and this test uncovered it.  But it was
          hard to debug because there was no single breakpoint to detect
          when the failure condition was triggered.

        * tests:
          Add new files to svn:ignore property.  Also added some old
          files.

        * tests/SSL:
        * include/makeinclude:
          Add missing files to svn:ignore

          Sun Feb 18 21:13:41 UTC 2007  coryan  <coryan@atdesk.com>

        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/Bug_2815_Regression_Test.cpp:
          Add new regression test for bug 2815.  I have not added the test
          to the automated test suite because (1) it fails, and (2) it is
          a test to reproduce performance

Thu Feb 22 12:58:42 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor:
          Removed BCB4/5 support

Thu Feb 22 11:19:59 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_dirent.inl:
          Added ACE_OS::alphasort(). alphasort() is a BSD extension found
          on Linux as well.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ALPHASORT_PROTOTYPE.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_ALPHASORT.

        * ace/os_include/os_dirent.h:
          Added alphasort prototype.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:
          Chaged to use use ACE_OS::alphasort().

Thu Feb 22 09:24:42 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Truncate.h (Truncate, truncate_cast):
          Also renamed the Borland part

Thu Feb 22 04:57:42 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp (test_connect):

          Fixed syntax error.  s/sizeof ACE_TCHAR/sizeof (ACE_TCHAR)/.

Wed Feb 21 21:46:18 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-pharlap.h:
        * ace/config-WinCE.h:
        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl: Changed ACE_LACKS_SETFILEPOINTEREX to
          ACE_LACKS_WIN32_SETFILEPOINTEREX to be consistent with the other
          ACE_*_WIN32_*things.

        * ace/config-pharlap.h:

        * examples/NT_Service/main.cpp:
          Also added ACE_LACKS_WIN32_SERVICES for Pharlap and CE. This marks
          a platform that is Windows, but doesn't have Windows services.

        * ace/Configuration.{h cpp}:
        * ace/Registry.{h cpp}: Rather than exclude registry-using code using
          ACE_HAS_PHARLAP, use a new setting ACE_LACKS_WIN32_REGISTRY.

        * ace/config-pharlap.h: Added ACE_LACKS_WIN32_REGISTRY.

        * protocols/ace/HTBP/HTBP_Environment.cpp:

          if ACE_LACKS_WIN32_REGISTRY is set.

        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Window_Messages.cpp: Don't try this if

          Decide on whether or not to compile the asynch support classes
          based on ACE_HAS_WIN32_OVERLAPPED_IO, not ACE_WIN32. ACE_WIN32
          is broader than that overlapped I/O-capable ones; Pharlap ETS
          doesn't do overlapped I/O, for instance.

Wed Feb 21 19:27:14 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/Array_Base.cpp (size):

          Simplified return value logic.

        * ace/Auto_Ptr.h (ACE_auto_ptr_reset):

          Added missing "brief" documentation.

        * ace/Caching_Strategies_T.inl:
        * ace/Svc_Handler.cpp (init):

          Removed unnecessary uses of ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro.  Just comment
          out the parameter name instead.

        * ace/DLL_Manager.cpp (unload_all):
        * ace/Functor.inl (operator()):
        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.h (sbrk):

        * ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp:

          Corrected type used to store pointer value.
          s/ptrdiff_t/{u}intptr_t/.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:

          Fixed unused argument warning.

        * ace/String_Base_Const.cpp:

          Workaround npos constant run-time initialization problem in some
          mixed shared/static linking conditions by making it easy for the
          compiler to embed the value of the constant in the object file
          at compile-time.

        * ace/Truncate.h (Truncate, truncate_cast):

          Deprecated ACE_Utils::Truncate() function name in favor of
          ACE_Utils::truncate_cast().  The former better reflects what the
          function template actually does.

        * ace/Unbounded_Set.cpp:
        * ace/Unbounded_Set.h:
        * ace/Unbounded_Set.inl:

          Implement find() method in terms of begin/end iterators to prevent
          search from looping indefinitely under some race condition
          scenarios.

          Added missing const_iterator factory methods.

          Added missing const_iterator equality and inequality operators.

          s/ACE_Utils::Truncate/ACE_Utils::truncate_cast/g.  The former is
          deprecated.

        From Andrew Schnable
        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h (X_OK):

          Windows has no access() test for X_OK.  Use R_OK instead.

        From Russell Mora
        * ace/ACE.inl (hex2byte):
        * ace/Capabilities.h (is_line, is_empty):
        * ace/Capabilities.cpp (parse, fillent, is_entry, is_empty, is_line):
        * ace/Get_Opt.cpp (long_option):
        * ace/OS_NS_ctype.inl (ace_isalnum):

          Added ACE::ace_isalnum, ACE::ace_isdigit and ACE::ace_islower
          and changed to use them where appropriate.  This prevents the
          narrow char versions being called with wide chars.

        * ace/Asynch_IO.cpp:

          Fixed preprocessor scoping issue in builds where
          ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS is undefined and versioned namspaces are
          enabled.   ACE_END_VERSIONED_NAMESPACE_DECL ended up being
          preprocessed when it should not have.

        * ace/Configuration_Import_Export.cpp (export_config):

          Check the return value of fclose() is required because data may
          have been buffered and will be fflush()d with the fclose().

        * ace/Log_Msg.h:
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:

          Changed message offset to correct type, ptrdiff_t, since it
          contains a pointer difference value.

        * ace/Null_Semaphore.h:

          Added include to get definition of size_t.  This is required for
          static single-threaded builds on Darwin.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (cuserid):

          Check for unexpected failure of getpwuid function; don't
          dereference null pointer.

        * ace/Process.cpp (spawn):

          On Windows platforms a process handle is a pointer, not an int.
          Corrected format specifiers accordingly.

        * ace/RB_Tree.cpp (remove_i):

         Fixes for Coverity REVERSE_INULL issues.  Check for null pointer
         before dereferencing.

        * ace/Recursive_Thread_Mutex.cpp (get_nesting_level):

          Reverted change that altered implementation for IA64 Windows
          builds.  The returned nesting level was incorrect.  Use the
          implementation used by both 32-bit and AMD 64 bit builds.

        * tests/Recursive_Mutex_Test.cpp (test_recursion_depth):

          Added test cases for the above problem.

        * ace/SOCK_Connector.cpp (shared_connect_finish):

          On Windows, in order to detect when the socket that has been
          bound to is in TIME_WAIT we need to do the connect (which will
          always return EWOULDBLOCK) and then do an
          ACE::handle_timed_complete() (with timeout==0, i.e. poll).  This
          will do a select() on the handle which will immediately return
          with the handle in an error state.  The error code is then
          retrieved with getsockopt().

          Good sockets however will return from the select() with ETIME -
          in this case return EWOULDBLOCK so the wait strategy can
          complete the connection.

        * ace/Service_Manager.cpp (list_services):

          Type conversion - it is unlikely the name of the service is a
          string bigger than 2GB (on 32-bit systems) so a static_cast<> is
          safe here.

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer.cpp (scan):

          Changed the loop indexing to allow loop variable to be the same
          type as variable used to initialise the loop.  This avoids
          conversion warnings.

          (yylex):

          Fixed unused variable warning.

        * ace/UNIX_Addr.inl (set):

          Correct wide string to narrow string conversion.

        * ace/config-cxx-common.h:

          Eliminated copious amounts of warnings.

        * ace/config-linux.h (ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME):
        * ace/config-linux-common.h (ACE_HAS_CLOCK_GETTIME):

          On linux clock_gettime/clock_settime are not available for
          single-threaded builds.

        * ace/os_include/os_dlfcn.h (ACE_DEFAULT_SHLIB_MODE):

          Added DYNAMIC_PATH to the default flags used to call shl_load()
          on HP 11.00 (PARISC1.1/32-bit) so that RPATH and SHLIB_PATH are
          searched to find the requested .sl.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd (FORCED_IDL_STUBS):

          PCH source files are also dependent on the IDL compiler
          generated files.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU (SONAME):

          HP platform (non-g++) was missing the appropriate LDFLAGS for
          building versioned shared libraries.  Copied from the hpux
          section of platform_g++_common.GNU.

          Disable warnings when 64 bit file offsets are enabled in HP
          11.11 builds.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_irix6.x_sgic++.GNU (AR, ARFLAGS):

          By default IRIX uses a prelinker to instantiate templates, thus
          archives need to be created via CC (using the -ar option) so
          that the required templates can be instantiated.  This was the
          cause of the missing symbols problems reported by users of the
          static libraries.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_cxx.GNU:

          It seems that the default debug level in the Compaq C++ compiler
          really goes to town when a template is instantiated - it seems
          to add debug information for every scrap of code that the
          template instantiation ever see resulting in debug template
          instantiations that are up to 1000x bigger than their release
          counterparts.  Dialing the level back down to -g1 (-g2 is the
          default) seems to avoid this issue and we still get debug
          symbols for the template instantiation itself.

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp (test_connect):

          Fixed potential buffer overrun error.

        From Duane Binder
        * ace/ace_wchar.h:

          Added ACE_TEXT_ macros needed by some apps.

        * ace/Process.inl (creation_flags):
        * ace/Naming_Context.cpp:
        * ace/Registry_Name_Space.cpp:
        * ace/Registry_Name_Space.h:

          Use ACE_USES_WCHAR not UNICODE.  Whether ACE uses Windows
          wchar_t APIs is controlled by ACE_USES_WCHAR and not UNICODE.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_freebsd.GNU:

          Remove pthread and semaphore references for singled threaded
          FreeBSD builds.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU (LIBS):

          Prevent single threaded linux builds from linking libpthread
          (via librt).

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:

          Not all static libraries have template instantiations.  Test if
          $(TEMPINCDIR) exists before trying to add objects in an archive
          library (was a problem on Tru64 with debug builds).

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

Tue Feb 20 19:15:30 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Adding Object_Manager_Flipping_Test to the list of running
          tests.

Tue Feb 20 18:08:47 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * tests/Object_Manager_Flipping_Test.cpp:
        * tests/tests.mpc:

          Adding new test verifying that after ACE::fini has been called,
          the correct pointer value has been stored in TSS for the Service
          Config.  A subsequent call to ACE::init may SEGV
          otherwise. Thanks to Bjoern Rasmussen <bjoern.d.rasmussen at
          gmail dot com> for reporting it.

Tue Feb 20 17:15:37 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_qnx_rtp_gcc.GNU:

          Moved the version detection from the platform_macros file to the
          config file.  This allows us to use the QNX system-defined macro
          _NTO_VERSION, which works in cross-compile environments.  The old
          method of reading the version number from the "uname -a" output is
          not compatible with cross-compilation.

Tue Feb 20 16:38:24 UTC 2007  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/global.features

          Added logic in gnu template for new XSC custom type in CIAO,
          and disabled xsc by default in global.features.

Tue Feb 20 16:12:57 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Bug_2820_Regression_Test.cpp: ACEify use of auto_ptr.

Tue Feb 20 16:06:12 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_stdlib.h:

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl:
        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:

Tue Feb 20 15:54:20 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Reverted my change to check PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.  I just realized
          that it may not be defined as an integral value (i.e., Solaris).

Tue Feb 20 15:46:06 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:

          Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG(id) for RTEMS and modified code to check
          that size (which is of type size_t) is less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
          only if PTHREAD_STACK_MIN is greater than zero.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp:

          Fixed a compile error on VxWorks where an attempt to cast
          ACE_thread_t to ACE_RANDR_TYPE failed (since ACE_thread_t is char*
          on VxWorks).

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.cpp:

          The iov_len element of the iovec struct is unsigned on RTEMS (as
          it is with Linux and Borland C++), so use the same #if check to
          avoid code that causes warnings.

Tue Feb 20 15:06:04 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp:

          Reverted a bug that was introduced many years ago where threads
          would be spawned and then the main thread would exit.

          Check addr.get_host_addr() for non-zero before passing it to
          ACE_OS::strcmp().

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h: Clarify description of ok_to_wait().

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (ok_to_wait): Since WinCE can't use the
          waitAll arg to atomically wait for both the lock and ok_to_wait
          event, use a 2-step process to get both individually. This avoids
          entering wfmo either without the ok_to_wait event or without
          the lock. Thanks to Craig Johnson for reporting this. Also see:

          Reverting my changes since "Tue Feb 13 15:35:54 UTC 2007" as it

          no-threads builds.

Fri Feb 16 12:47:03 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.cpp (global): Removed the ACE_INLINE qualifier
          from global() - if it's in the .cpp file, it shouldn't be marked
          as inline, and isn't marked thusly in the .h file. Fixes unsats.

        * ace/Service_Config.h: Fixed spelling error.

Thu Feb 15 20:04:01 UTC 2007  Ossama Othman  <ossama_othman at symantec dot com>

        * ace/OS_NS_stdlib.cpp (mkstemp_emulation):

          Include process and thread ID in random number generator seed
          value.  Addresses problems where the same seed value would end
          up being used for different processes and/or threads, resulting
          in identical filenames being generated.

          Addressed potential race condition on platforms that do not
          inline the value of ACE_Numeric_Limits<>::max().

        * examples/OS/Process/imore.cpp:

          Removed an enclosing block around code that caused issue with
          SunCC 5.8.  There was a comment claiming that the block was needed
          so that the ACE_Process_Options could elegantly close the file
          handlers that it kept, however the ACE_Process_Options object does
          not close the file handlers.  The ACE_Process does the handle
          closing.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Moved the ACE_Unmanaged_Singleton usage to the implementation
          file and eliminated the unnecesary #includes, aiming to reduce
          the footprint.

Wed Feb 14 17:33:22 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Fixing a compile problem with g++ and borland compiler, which
          treat members of private nested classes as "hidden" even when
          the enclosing type has been exported.

Wed Feb 14 12:59:58 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Acceptor.h:
          Doxygen improvement

Wed Feb 14 11:31:58 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/os_include/os_stdio.h:
        * ace/os_include/os_unistd.h:
          Move ACE_STDIN, ACE_STDOUT and ACE_STDERR from stdio to unistd
          file and use STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO and STDERROR_FILENO if
          these are defined yet, this way we use the same defines and header
          files as in the posix specification. This fixes bugzilla bug 2731.
          Thanks to Abdul Sowayan <abdullah dot sowayan at lmco dot com>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/Truncate.h:

Tue Feb 13 15:35:54 UTC 2007  Iliyan Jeliazkov  <iliyan@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Service_Config.{h,inl,cpp}:

          Refactoring to simplify the TSS usage, reduce overhead and
          eliminate a memory leak.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:

          Fixed a memory leak in Service_Type_Dynamic_Guard dtor. Updated
          logging.

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:
        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Dependency.cpp:

          Updated to use SC::instance () to better express the contract
          for these classes. They simply don't need to be aware whether
          they are using a global, or a TSS-local gestalt .

Tue Feb 13 14:44:06 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:

          Changed the print() and message() methods to const.  There was no
          reason for thease to be non-const and it makes it possible to
          catch const references of the ACEXML exception types.

Mon Feb 12 14:38:06 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/CORBA_macros.h:
          Use ACE_LACKS_DEPRECATED_MACROS to make it possible to build without
          all the emulated exception macros. Will make sure people can't use them
          anymore in core code without noticing that

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
          Just define ACE_THROW_SPEC again as about a week ago, we need a fuzz check
          to make sure people don't use this anymore in TAO

        * ace/Reactor.h:
          Layout change

        * tests/Thread_Manager_Test.cpp:

Mon Feb 12 14:35:25 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/doxygen-convert-h.pl:

          Allow filenames or directories.  If a directory is passed, it is

Mon Feb 12 13:57:06 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * etc/*.doxygen:
          Removed ACE_THROW_SPEC

Sat Feb 10 23:13:06 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Svc_Conf_Lexer.cpp (ace_yy_buffer_state): Disable VC8 warning
          C4351 (input_ elements will be default-initialized) for this
          block. The new behavior is good and desireable, so the warning
          noise can be silenced in this case.

        * ace/Timer_Hash_T.cpp (reschedule, schedule_i): When calculating the
          hash value, truncate the seconds value down to size_t range because
          the modulo value used to hash is a size_t. Avoids a compile warning
          about losing data when time_t is larger than size_t.

Fri Feb  9 21:40:02 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.inl:
        * ace/High_Res_Timer.cpp:

          Removed ACE_WIN32 specific code in ACE_High_Res_Timer to reflect
          the change in the default value of ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION.
          Removed uses of ACE_HRTIME_CONVERSION and use
          ACE_Utils::Truncate instead.

        * ace/OS_NS_time.h:

          Changed the check for defining ACE_HRTIME_CONVERSION and
          ACE_HRTIME_TO_U64 from ACE_HRTIME_T_IS_BASIC_TYPE to
          ACE_LACKS_UNSIGNEDLONGLONG_T.

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp:

          Updated the test to use ACE_Utils::Truncate instead of
          static_cast which caused 0 to be output when time_t is 64-bit.

Fri Feb  9 12:19:57 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:

          Fixed a bug where the end of the ACE_THROW_SPEC would not be
          recognized.

          Thanks to Mouna Seri <seri at crhc dot uiuc dot edu> for
          reporting this.

Thu Feb  8 19:40:30 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Makefile.am:
        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Time_Request_Reply.{h cpp}:
        * netsvcs/lib/Makefile.am:
        * netsvcs/lib/lib.mpc:
        * netsvcs/lib/Time_Request_Reply.{h cpp}: Moved Time_Request_Reply
          from ace to netsvcs; it's only used from netsvcs and is only useful
          as an example of some ACE usage. Real time synch needs should be
          met using NTP.

        * ace/Name_Request_Reply.{h cpp}: Changed the sec_timeout_ transfer
          member from ACE_UINT32 to ACE_UINT64 to accomodate 64-bit time_t.

        * netsvcs/lib/TS_Clerk_Handler.h:
        * netsvcs/lib/TS_Server_Handler.h: Time_Request_Reply.h now is included
          from netsvcs/lib, not ace.

        * netsvcs/lib/Time_Request_Reply.{h cpp}: Changed the time-passing
          API arguments in the constructor and time() methods from ACE_UINT32
          to time_t. The on-wire protocol buffer fields that carry seconds
          values between clerk and server were changed from ACE_UINT32 to
          ACE_UINT64 to accomodate 64-bit time_t values.

        * NEWS: Explained the user-visible ramifications of these changes.

Thu Feb  8 09:23:50 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/MMAP_Memory_Pool.cpp:
          Removed empty else statement.

Thu Feb  8 08:03:57 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:

Wed Feb  7 23:04:49 UTC 2007  Wallace Zhang  <zhang_w@ociweb.com>

        * bin/tao_other_tests.lst:

          Added two existing Notify Service examples into the autotest list.

Wed Feb  7 21:01:39 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Added a bit of info about building for National
          Instruments' LabVIEW RT which uses Pharlap ETS. In particular, if
          building for LabVIEW's Pharlap, add #define ACE_PHARLAP_LABVIEW_RT
          to your config.h file along with #include "ace/config-pharlap.h"
          to adjust for slight differences between stock Pharlap and
          LabVIEW RT's variant.

        * ace/config-pharlap.h: Pharlap doesn't supply InterlockedExchangeAdd
          and doesn't do SetFilePointerEx (needs ACE_LACKS_SETFILEPOINTEREX).

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (sched_params): Don't attempt SetPriorityClass
          on Pharlap - it's not defined.

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl (thr_getprio): For Pharlap ETS, use
          EtsGetTimeSlice() to determine the scheduling policy; if the time
          slice is anything other than 0, it's multitasking ACE_SCHED_OTHER.

        * ace/OS_NS_stdio.inl (cuserid): Pharlap doesn't go GetUserName() so
          make it ACE_NOTSUP_RETURN.
          (adjust_flock_params): Use SetFilePointer() instead of
          SetFilePointerEx(), even with 64 bit offsets, if
          ACE_LACKS_SETFILEPOINTEREX is set.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (pwrite): For Windows platforms without
          overlapped I/O, don't rely on availability of SetFilePointerEx -
          platforms that have it also have overlapped I/O. In this case, use
          SetFilePointer with appropriate call differences for 32/64 bit
          file offsets.

        * ace/Pagefile_Memory_Pool.{h inl cpp}: Pharlap doesn't do this class.

        * ace/Configuration.{h cpp}:
        * ace/Registry.{h cpp}: The Windows registry is not available in
          Pharlap.

Wed Feb  7 14:44:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:

          Added the ability to remove the ACE_THROW_SPEC's completely.

Tue Feb  6 16:44:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Global_Macros.h:
          For the moment expand ACE_THROW_SPEC to nothing, we want to deprecate
          this in TAO and want to see the impact of this on the tests

Tue Feb  6 15:36:00 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Time_Value.inl: Remove the #if around #include "ace/Truncate.h"
          because ACE_Utils::Truncate is needed in a case that's not in a
          ACE_HAS_TIME_T_LONG_MISMATCH block.

Mon Feb  5 19:58:39 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp (operator>>): Use ACE_Utils::Truncate to truncate
          the received 64-bit time seconds to time_t.

Mon Feb  5 17:16:20 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-8.h: Added a new setting for Windows VC8,
          ACE_HAS_TIME_T_LONG_MISMATCH, to capture the case that requires
          a replacement timeval def. See the following for details:
          Thu Feb  1 23:46:27 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>
          This change isolates just the desktop VC8 compiler for the change,
          avoiding compilers that don't need it and/or can't deal with
          the code.

        * ace/Time_Value.{h inl}: Change code that uses a replacement timeval
          from ACE_WIN32 to ACE_HAS_TIME_T_LONG_MISMATCH.

Fri Feb  2 14:45:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:
          Fixed compile error

Fri Feb  2 14:32:06 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:
          Modified default behavior (if no -a, -o, -t, -C options are given)
          so that the script looks for TAO in $TAO_ROOT as well as
          $ACE_ROOT/TAO and similarly for CIAO.  This change supports the peer
          style layout.

Fri Feb  2 14:08:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/rm_exception_macros.pl:
          Also zap ACE_THROW_RETURN from application code, that is also
          deprecated now

Fri Feb  2 12:03:00 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/TSS_T.cpp:
          Fixed merge error

Fri Feb  2 11:43:00 UTC 2007  Simon Massey  <sma@prismtech.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Supress 3.xx warnings about non-return from functions
          (Anoyingly it doesn't seem to think that a throw
          terminates the execution flow of a function.)

Fri Feb  2 10:47:55 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/Proactor.cpp:
          Layout change.

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Enabled POSIX_SIG_PROACTOR and made some cleanups.

        * ace/os_include/net/os_if.h:
          Removed LynxOS specific include.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp:
          Enabled these tests again even if ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SIGEVENT_STRUCT
          is defined.

Fri Feb  2 10:31:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/CORBA_macros.h:
          Removed workaround for ACE_THROW_RETURN for HP aCC compiler. This is
          only needed for the HP 3.x compiler and we can suppress just this
          warning. When this has been build on the scoreboard we will
          zap the usage of this macro.

Fri Feb  2 06:56:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/ACETAOCIAO.style:
          Configuration file for profactor (see www.profactor.co.uk), a
          code beautifier tool that we want to use to reformat the code
          in ACE/TAO/CIAO.

Thu Feb  1 23:46:27 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * NEWS: Note change to ACE_Log_Record constructor.

        * ace/Log_Record.h (constructor): The "long time_stamp" argument was
          changed from long to time_t to correspond with what's expected.

        * ace/Log_Record.{h inl cpp}: The secs_ value was changed from
          ACE_UINT32 to time_t and is handled as a ACE_CDR::LongLong in the
          CDR insertion and extraction operators. The encode() and decode()
          methods are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
          ACE.

        * ace/Message_Block.cpp (priority_status): Cast sec() value to
          suseconds_t size to avoid truncation warnings.

        * ace/Time_Value.{h inl cpp}: Use a private struct to manage time
          internally for Windows since Windows' struct timeval uses long
          values internally instead of the standard time_t/suseconds_t
          that the class API uses (and POSIX uses in timeval). When a
          real OS-defined timeval is needed, build it on the fly for Windows.

        * tests/High_Res_Timer_Test.cpp: When logging ACE_Time_Value-obtained
          sec/usec values, truncate them down to u_int size. Avoids passing
          64-bit values to ACE_Log_Msg when only 32 bits will be taken from
          the arg vector for a %u format spec. Fixes crashing of this test
          on Win/VC8.

        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Monitor.cpp:
        * examples/APG/Naming/Temperature_Monitor2.cpp: Treat time as an int
          instead of a time_t; makes the logic easier even though it'll break
          sometime in 2038.

        * examples/ASX/UPIPE_Event_Server/event_server.cpp: Unify use of time_t
          to hold time values from ACE_OS::time().

        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP-inclient.cpp: When measuring messages
          per second, truncate seconds down to a 'long' to avoid truncation
          warnings at compile time from converting to double.

        * examples/Reactor/Misc/notification.cpp (svc): Initialize an
          ACE_Time_Value with secs / 2 instead of getting the seconds,
          multiplying into usecs, then dividing by 2. Avoids data truncation
          issues.

        * examples/Reactor/Multicast/Log_Wrapper.cpp (log_message): Cast
          result of time() to long to insert in the multicast buffer. Avoids
          truncation warning. Will stop recording a legit result sometime in
          2038 but the receiver isn't looking at the time field.

        * apps/gperf/src/Gen_Perf.cpp:
        * ASNMP/tests/test_config.h (randomize):
        * examples/Reactor/WFMO_Reactor/Multithreading.cpp:
        * protocols/ace/RMCast/Link.cpp:
        * protocols/ace/RMCast/Simulator.cpp:
        * protocols/examples/TMCast/Member/member.cpp:
        * tests/Auto_Event_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Handle_Set_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Recursive_Mutex_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Semaphore_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Thread_Mutex_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Timer_Queue_Test.cpp: Cast time_t to u_int for use as an
          ACE_OS::srand() seed - we just want some bits, not to fit it back in
          range with ACE_Utils::Truncate.

Thu Feb  1 11:21:32 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp:
        * ace/Proactor.cpp:
        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/config-lynxos.h:

          Introduced a new feature test macro ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SIGEVENT_STRUCT
          to make POSIX_CB_Proactor compile on FreeBSD 7.0-CURRENT.

        * tests/Proactor_Test.cpp:
        * tests/Proactor_Test_IPV6.cpp:

          Modified due to changes above.

Thu Feb  1 08:05:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Message_Queue.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Fixed compile errors in the NT Message Queue when build without
          threading under windows

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp:
          Layout changes

Wed Jan 31 23:06:42 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h:

          Replaced ACE_LACKS_CUSERID with ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID to get the ACE
          library to provide us with a cuserid() function.

        * ASNMP/asnmp/asn1.cpp:
        * apps/drwho/global.h:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/C-inclient.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/C-inserver.cpp:
        * examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/CPP-inclient.cpp:

        * examples/Reactor/Multicast/Log_Wrapper.cpp:
        * examples/Reactor/Multicast/server.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Name_Handler.cpp:

          Replaced htonl, htons, ntohl, and ntohs with the appropriate
          ACE_XTOYZ macro (ACE_HTONL, for example).  QNX doesn't have htonl and
          friends without adding extra #includes.

Wed Jan 31 19:03:37 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Basic_Types.h:

          Added constants ACE_FLT_MIN and ACE_DBL_MIN to provide consistency
          with ACE_FLT_MAX AND ACE_DBL_MAX.

        * ace/CDR_Base.h:
        * ace/CDR_Base.cpp:

          Enhanced the ACE_CDR::LongDouble class which is used on platforms
          where the native long double is not 16 bytes.

          Provided operators to support multiplication, division, addition
          and subtraction as well as conversion to the native long double.

          An assign() method is also provided to set the value of the
          ACE_CDR::LongDouble.  Since this class will be stored in a union
          (if used as an IDL type), it can not have a non-trivial constructor
          or assignment operator.  The existing
          ACE_CDR_LONG_DOUBLE_INITIALIZER macro is used to initialize the
          LongDouble and a new macro, ACE_CDR_LONG_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT, is
          used to assign to the LongDouble in a portable fashion.

        * bin/tao_orb_tests.lst:

          Added the new TAO LongDouble test.

Wed Jan 31 17:30:46 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: If stdcpplib=0 is
          selected at build time, explicitly set -AP compile option to use
          old C++ libraries and no std namespace. Also set
          ACE_LACKS_NUMERIC_LIMITS when -AP is set - there is a numeric_limits
          but not in std. Note that ACE_Array_Map won't build with stdcpplib=0
          but pre-ACE-5.5 legacy code will still build.

          Also removed the HP-UX 10.x remnants and pre-3.0 aC++ support
          from platform_hpux_aCC.GNU. Could probably safely remove more old
          compiler support (anything older than 3.56 probably) but I played
          it a little conservative for now.

Wed Jan 31 17:22:11 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * protocols/examples/examples.mwc:

          Removed the implicit usage.  It is not necessary since each
          example has a .mpc file.

        * protocols/examples/example_base.mpb:

          Removed this file.  It was not needed.

Wed Jan 31 16:55:23 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-qnx-rtp-62x.h:

          Removed #define ACE_HAS_INLINED_OSCALLS as it seems to be both rarely
          used (only oddball platforms like unixware and other QNX versions
          have it) and also incompatible with inline=0 builds.
          Also added new config macros ACE_LACKS_STRPTIME (June 2006) and
          ACE_HAS_3_PARAM_READDIR_R (December 2006).
          These modifications have been tested with QNX 6.3 but from the docs
          on the QNX web site I believe they apply to QNX 6.2 as well.

Wed Jan 31 15:44:54 UTC 2007  Olli Savia  <ops@iki.fi>

        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.h:
        * ace/POSIX_CB_Proactor.cpp:
          Use sigval (which is SUS defined) instead of sigval_t. If this
          change doesn't break on any platform I'll remove unnecessary
          typedef and related stuff.

Wed Jan 31 13:31:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Removed obsolete checks for environment macros

        * ace/Recycable.h:
          Removed empty brief doxygen tag

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl:
        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Renamed ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SZ_PAGESIZE to ACE_HAS_NOTSUP_SC_PAGESIZE

Wed Jan 31 13:21:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Added improvement for GCC on HPUX IA64

Wed Jan 31 10:17:14 UTC 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU:
          Improved support for GCC on HPUX IA64

Wed Jan 31 07:50:44 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.cpp (ACE_OS::sched_params):  Check if the
          ACE_id_t id that is being passed in is equal to ACE_SELF.  If
          so, pass ::GetCurrentProcessId() to ::OpenProcess() instead of
          id.  ACE_SELF is defined to be 0 on ACE_WIN32; process id 0 is
          the zero-page process, and we certainly don't want to attempt to
          set it to REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS :-)

Wed Jan 31 03:25:51 UTC 2007  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@nospam.invalid.domain>

        * ace/High_Res_Timer.h:

          Removed the special case default definition of
          ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION to ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_MSECS on Windows;
          added a #ifndef around the default definition in case the user
          wishes to change it.  This was done to prevent useless values
          like 0 showing up in calculations using ACE_Basic_Stats when the
          time intervals are of the order of a few microseconds.  Most of
          the current machines have a QueryPerformanceCounter()
          implementation that returns a value of atleast 3 MHz.  So it
          should be completely safe to use the definition of
          ACE_ONE_SECOND_IN_USECS as the default value for
          ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION on contemporary x86 machines running
          Windows.

        * ace/Message_Block.inl:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp:

          Moved the definition of
          ACE_Dynamic_Message_Strategy::priority_status() from
          Message_Block.inl to Message_Block.cpp.  It was a big function
          and it currently has code that causes a warning with VC8 on
          Windows.

Tue Jan 30 19:21:50 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Module.h:

          Removed the trailing comma from the last element of the enum.

Tue Jan 30 16:26:43 UTC 2007  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/sets-manager.py:

          Modified to pin the version of MPC at the time of branching/tagging
          under modules/ACE/MPC.  Note:  This does not branch OR tag MPC,
          it simply causes the branch/tag to check out a specific
          revision of MPC.

Tue Jan 30 13:51:32 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Module.h:
        * ace/Module.cpp:

          There was no way to distinguish between flags not being set and
          flags to indicate that tasks should not be deleted.  I have
          changed the M_DELETE_NONE enum value to 4 and added a new enum
          value for use in flag initialization.  With this change, the
          close() method can determine if it needs to use the flags passed
          in or the internal flags.  This fixes Bugzilla #2497.

Tue Jan 30 11:35:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Countdown_Time.{h,cpp}:
          Readded destructor, missed that it updates the max_wait_time
          passed to the constructor

Tue Jan 30 10:44:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          When pipes is set to 1, also add -pipe to the CCFLAGS

        * include/makeinclude/platform_rtems.x_g++.GNU:
          Set pipes to 1, set DCCFLAGS

Tue Jan 30 10:14:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Unbounded_Set.cpp:
          Initialise pointer with 0.

        * ace/OS_NS_unistd.inl (getpagesize):
        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          RTEMS does define _SC_PAGESIZE, but using sysconf with _SC_PAGESIZE
          results in -1. Added a new define ACE_HAS_BROKEN_SC_PAGESIZE to be
          able to disable the usage of sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE) for rtems 4.6,
          the ::getpagesize() function returns a correct value.

Tue Jan 30 09:46:14 2007  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/OS_Test.cpp:
          Added a test for ACE_OS::getpagesize(), it should return a value
          bigger then 0 else the memory pools don't work

Tue Jan 30 00:25:00 UTC 2007  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-hpux-11.00.h: If the user sets RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE to
          keep a lot of the standard C++ library out of the std namespace,
          avoid setting ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB, and also
          hoist everything else from std into the global namespace. This is
          necessary because RW wasn't consistent with using their internal
          _RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE and the user-settable RWSTD_NO_NAMESPACE and
          some things end up in std and some not; so get the ones that ended
          up in std out to global with the rest of them.

        * ace/config-tru64.h:
          Removed ACE_HAS_MEMCHR

        * ace/config-doxygen.h:
          Enabled COIOP and Transport Current

        * ace/config-macros.h:
          Deprecated ACE_TYPENAME, users can still use it, but in some builds
          on the daily scoreboard it now can't be used anymore

        * ace/config-mvs.h:
          Improved MVS support

        * ace/os_include/sys/os_types.h:
        * ace/Task.cpp:
          Added support for MVS

        * ace/OS_NS_string.{h,cpp,inl}:
          Replaced ACE_HAS_MEMCHR with ACE_LACKS_MEMCHR, this way a platform that
          lacks this method has to set an explicit define, maybe it now shows
          that all platforms have this method and we don't need an emulation
          anymore. Also removed several emulations that are not needed anymore

        * ace/OS_NS_Thread.inl:
          Layout changes

        * ace/OS_NS_wchar.{h,cpp}:
          Changed second argument of wcschr_emulation to wchar_t, that way we don't
          need a cast anymore

        * ace/Rtems_init.c:
          Improved this file

        * ace/Sock_Connect.cpp:
          Initialise some pointers with 0

        * bin/cvslog:
          Removed, not needed anymore

        * bin/fuzz.pl:
          Removed checks for emulated exception macros

        * examples/Export/run_test.pl:
          Use ACE_ROOT
