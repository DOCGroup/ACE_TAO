        * ace/ace_for_tao.mpc:
          Add uuid as base project. For building COIOP as part of the
          TAO strategies library we need uuid. The nicest solution would
          be to make the uuid feature dependent on the ace_for_tao
          feature and let the user overrule this but that is not
          possible yet. If you are using ace_for_tao and don't want
          to have uuid pulled in, set uuid explicitly to 0 in your
          default.features file.

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Refactored handling of %W. Added a check for a nill pointer
          as we have for ascii strings. Fixes bugzilla 2277.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:
          Added test for %W with a string as argument and with a
          nill pointer. Fixes bugzilla 2715.

        * ace/FlReactor*.*:
        * ace/XtReactor*.*:
        * ace/TkReactor*.*:
          Moved these reactors to their own subdirectories to make
          maintenance a lot easier.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core_anytypecode.mpb:
          Removed svn:executable property

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/core_strategies.mpb
          New base project for the strategies library when build in
          ace_for_tao configuration

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/orbsvcslib.mpb:
          Removed -GT so that we also don't generate TIE files for the
          orbsvcs anymore. Will speedup builds and simplify other mpc
          files

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/config/strategies.mpb
          Derive from core_strategies. Now the strategies library
          does get build in an ace_for_tao configuration but
          shmiop and uiop are not build at all, other protocols
          can be build. This way we can build COIOP in an ace_for_tao
          setup

        * bin/make_release:
          Removed dsp/dsw reference, corrected naming of the ACE
          packages when the version number gets added.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU:
          Removed HPUX 10.20 support

        * include/makeinclude/platform_lynxos.GNU:
          ACE_HAS_BROKEN_THREAD_KEYFREE is now set in the config file

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Removed ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 checks

        * docs/run_test.txt:
          Document ACE_RUN_VX_TGT_HOST

        * docs/bczar/bczar.html:
          Updated this file

        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/POSIX_Proactor.cpp:
          Added ACE_HAS_SIGVAL_SIGVAL_INT, this fixes bugzilla
          bug 2716. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues
          <rodrigc at crodrigues dot org> for reporting this.

        * ace/ace.mpc:
          Added missing OS.inl. This fixes bugzilla bug 2705.
          Thanks to Daniel Black <dragonheart at gentoo dot org>
          for reporting this.

        * Release:
          Removed dsw files

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
        * ace/config-posix-nonetworking.h:
          Moved the configuration to build without no networking
          support to its own file so that we can reuse this for
          example on linux

        * ace/config-rtems.h:
          Added support for rtems 4.7

        * ace/config-unixware-7.1.0.udk.h:
          Cleanup

        * ace/config-lyxos.h:
          Added support for LynxOS 4.2

        * ace/config-linux.h:
        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
          Moved ACE_HAS_GETIFADDRS to the common file and added
          support for ACE_LACKS_NETWORKING on linux

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:
        * ace/OS_NS_netdb.cpp
          Fixed compile problem when using ACE_LACKS_NETWORKING on
          linux

        * ace/Obstack.h:
          Use ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARATION to resolve link errors
          on FC6. Thanks to Ken Sedgwick <ken at bonsai dot com> for
          reporting this and testing out the patch.

        * ace/OS_NS_string.inl:
          Initialise pointer with 0
