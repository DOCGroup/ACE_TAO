        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.inl (recv_i): Remove the incorrect comment
          form the syscall case about falling through to the default. That's
          not right. Thanks to Simon Massey for pointing this out.

        * ace/Sig_Handler.cpp (remove_handler_i): Check if the event handler
          pointer is 0 before calling through it. Thanks to Adam Mitz
          for catching this one.

        * ace/Sig_Handler.h:
        * ace/Sig_Handler.cpp: Call back to ACE_Event_Handler::handle_close()
          when a signal handler is removed by any means. The callback was
          previously made only when dispatched handle_signal() returned -1.
          This adds the callback when the signal handler is unregistered
          either explicitly or by a containing reactor closing. Resolves
          Bugzilla #2368.

        * ace/Process_Manager.h:
        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp: Added a handle_close() method to be notified
          when a reactor with which SIGCHLD is registered closes, so no
          attempt is later made to remove the SIGCHLD registration.

        * NEWS: Describe the above enhancement.

        * tests/Bug_2368_Regression_Test.cpp: Register the two handlers for
          different signals so they're both tracked and removed properly.

        * tests/run_test.lst: Enable Bug_2368_Regression_Test.

Thu Sep  6 15:06:15 UTC 2012  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (close): Don't try to lock/unlock the
          ACE_LOG_MSG_INSTANCE lock if it's already been freed.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.inl (recv_i): Added back in logic to wait
          for data available to receive when called with a timeout. Thanks
          to Ossama Othman for helping to sort this out. For reference, the
          issues involved here are well-explained in "SSL and TLS" by
          Eric Rescorla, section 8.9.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (recv_n): Removed the hack-y retry on
          EWOULDBLOCK - the proper handling of timeouts is now in its proper
          place in recv_i() - see above.

        * ace/config-macosx-leopard.h:
          Added missing defines to get ACE to compile on MacOSX, thanks to
          Thomas Lockhart <Thomas dot Lockhart at jpl dot nasa dot gov>
          for reporting this

        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.h:
        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.inl:
        * Kokyu/Dispatch_Deferrer.cpp:
          These files have been removed. They appear to be completly unreferenced by any
          other files in the whole ACE/TAO/CIAO/DAnCE distribution and are not even currently
          built within the Kokyu library itself. They appear to be incomplete relics of the
          original 2003 development of this library, and include references to an incomplete
          class Dispatch_Deferrer_Attributes which has no declaration or definition anywhere
          in the current distribution. These files would not compile even if they where listed
          in the kokyu MPC file.
