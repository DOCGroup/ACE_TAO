        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.{h inl cpp}: Refinements to the way notifies
          are handled:
            1. The notify handler was being dispatched multiple times per
               notify; this has been fixed, which increases performance.
            2. Notifications are now dispatched in only one thread at a time.
               This brings more parity to the way notifies are handled in
               other reactor implementations.

Wed Mar 17 11:58:10 UTC 2010  Vladimir Zykov  <vladimir.zykov@prismtech.com>

        Committed the changes that I had to revert before x.7.7.

        * ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
          Changed the code so that close() is called in case of failure
          instead of destroy().

        * ace/Connector.cpp:
        * ace/Connector.h:
          Changed the fix for bug#3731. Now NBCH adds a reference in
          constructor and removes it in destructor if the SVC_HANDLER that
          it owns is reference counted. This is a cleaner solution than the
          one used before.

        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.h:
        * tests/Process_Strategy_Test.cpp:
        * tests/NonBlocking_Conn_Test.cpp:
          Extended NonBlocking_Conn_Test and changed Process_Strategy_Test
          because of the change in Strategies_T.cpp.

        * tests/MT_NonBlocking_Connect_Test.cpp:
        * tests/tests.mpc:
        * tests/run_test.lst:
          Added a new test. This can be a reproducer for the bug#3731 which
          currently doesn't have its own test.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.h:
        * ace/Service_Config.h:
          Extended doxygen documentaion related to the order of processing
          of command-line directives and service configuration files.

        * ace/Service_Gestalt.cpp:
          Changed the order of processing. First, service configuration files
          are processed then command-line directive. This way default svc.conf
          can not override results of user provided command-line directives.

        * NEWS:
          Added a news entry for this change.

        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX.pm:
        * bin/PerlACE/ProcessVX_Unix.pm:

          Added an option to use the 'expect' program to interact with
          the remote target (via telnet).  This is only enabled when the
          environment variable ACE_RUN_VX_USE_EXPECT is defined.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:

          Updated the ACE_VXWORKS version check to include version 6.8.

        * tests/run_test.lst:

          Added !VxWorks to exclude Pipe_Test which can't be run
          on VxWorks (kernel mode) because it depends on ACE_Process::spawn().

        * bin/mpc.pl:
        * bin/mwc.pl:

          Some platforms have been reported to return undef from

          Fixed gcc warning

Mon Mar  8 08:35:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          Added specializations for bool/unsigned short/short, is around 7 times
          faster than the default atomic op

Mon Mar  8 08:24:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:

Fri Mar  5 14:02:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configure.ac:
          Added test for GCC builtin support

Fri Mar  5 12:40:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
          We did a benchmark on a FC10 64bit system with the GCC builtin support
          for long/unsigned long. In a release/inline build the performance
          results using the GCC builtin support is around 2 times faster than
          when using the ACE assembly version. When we have the GCC builtin support,
          we now also going to use that for long/unsigned long.

Fri Mar  5 12:20:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Atomic_Op.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op.inl:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.cpp:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.h:
        * ace/Atomic_Op_GCC_T.inl:
          Added new Atomic template for the GCC builtin atomic op support.
          This is used on PPC64/PPC32/IA64 for int/unsigned int/long/unsigned long.
          On EM64T we do use this for int/unsigned int, the ACE assembly version for
          long/unsigned long is faster than the GCC.

          On FC10 64bit the int/unsigned int Atomic_Op is now around 6 to 7 times
          faster than before this change

        * ace/config-g++-common.h:
          Enable the new builtin atomic also for EM64T

        * ace/ace.mpc:
        * ace/Makefile.am:
          Added new files

Fri Mar  5 11:30:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Print the number of iterations

Fri Mar  5 11:28:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Also measure postfix increment/decrement

Fri Mar  5 11:21:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Added more checks to make sure Atomic_Op does work

Tue Mar  2 21:02:51 UTC 2010  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Dev_Poll_Reactor.cpp (mask_ops_i): If the specified handle is
          not registered, return -1 instead of crashing.

Thu Mar  4 09:15:54 UTC 2010  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Fix for problems with creating MPC release tag.

Thu Mar  4 07:50:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Atomic_Op_Test.cpp:
          Rewritten this test to use a template method so that we can
          test atomic op easily for various data types

        * ace/Time_Value.cpp:
          Layout changes and fixed compile problem with CB2010. This fixes
          bugzilla 3835, thanks to Jan Kalin <jan dot kalin at zag dot si>
          for reporting this.

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          CB also has long timevalue mismatch

Thu Mar  4 07:50:54 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * NEWS:

          Several updates because we now package on a FC12 system

        * debianbuild/rules:
          Removed commented out part

        * bin/make_release.py:
          Next micro release will not ship msvc71 solutions, it is still
          supported but the end user should generate the solutions him self.
          Also WinCE solutions are not generated anymore for CIAO and the
          autoconf bootstrapping is done much earlier in the release process
          so when it fails we know early. The hostname check has been removed

        * bin/diff-builds-and-group-fixed-tests-only.sh:
          Updated because of micro release
