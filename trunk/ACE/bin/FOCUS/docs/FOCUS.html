<h3><b><a name="MOT">Introduction</a></b></h3>
TAO is a highly flexible ORB that contains a wide range of ORB
configuration options. One or more of these options can be combined
to meet various application requirements, such as low-latency,
predictable real-time behavior, or small memory footprint. TAO's ORB
configuration options are managed by an object-oriented framework
within the ORB Core.  TAO ORB internally uses several objects called
<b>Resources</b>, such
as a <em>reactor</em> framework that demultiplexes new connection and
data requests from a client or <em>pluggable protocol</em> framework
to seamlessly work across different protocols.  <b>Strategies</b>, are
objects that use the <b>Resource</b> entities to perform various ORB tasks,
such as connection management, concurrency, and demultiplexing.
The <b>Service Configurator</b> is a framework that can be used
to statically and dynamically configure components into middleware and
applications.

Most often, applications that run on top of TAO use only one concrete type
of each resource. For example, predominantly TAO applications use the IIOP
protocol for communication.  In this case, the underlying framework that
realizes the feature can be specialized to remove dynamic dispatching
overheads. The Feature Oriented Customizer (FOCUS) tool provides a
generic approach to enable middleware developers to specialize middleware
Frameworks when the concrete resource type is known a priori.
FOCUS provides an XML based transformation engine, where the
specialization transformations are captured in XML file and a
weaver specializes the code. Some important points to note about FOCUS
and specialization:
<ul>
 <li>It does not modify an interface. So no application level changes are
     necessary.
 </li>
 <li>Once a framework has been customized using FOCUS for a concrete component,
     other components do not work. For example, specializing the protocol
     framework with IIOP, precludes the ability to plug-in other protocol
     implementations.
 </li>
 <li>It provides a source-to-source transformations that require re-compiling
     the source.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3><b><a name="FCS-ORG">FOCUS Tool Organization</a></b></h3>
FOCUS tool structure is organized as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Parser directory has all parser related modules</li>
  <li>specializations: Rules data base that has the XML files required for
      performing the individual specialization transformations. For each
      specialization we have the following sub directories:
      <ul>
        <li>Reactor_Family: Specializations for ACE_Reactor family</li>
        <li>Protocol_Family: Specializations for TAO's protocol family</li>
        <li>Messaging_Strategy: Specializations for TAO's Messaging Strategy</li>
        <li>Wait_Strategy: Specializations for TAO's Wait strategies</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

A detailed overview of the FOCUS specialization language, that specifies the
different types for specialization transformations supported in FOCUS is
discussed here: {To be updated shortly!}

<h3><b><a name="FCS-ORG">Extending FOCUS</a></b></h3>
To add a new specializations, to FOCUS, one needs to do the following:
<ol>
 <li>Use the FOCUS specification language to model the different specialization
     Transformations required. Add this to the repository under
     FOCUS/specializations. Current convention is to use a directory for each
     family or specific type of specialization and add specialization files
     for each type in the family.
 </li>
 <li>Annotate the middleware source code where ever applicable to perform the
     transformations.
 </li>
 <li>Modify the FOCUS.pl script to add a specific option similar to --reactor-spl
     option for executing the specializations. Also update the specialization
     table that maps the command-line option to the appropriate specialization
     file within the repository.
  </li>
</ol>
