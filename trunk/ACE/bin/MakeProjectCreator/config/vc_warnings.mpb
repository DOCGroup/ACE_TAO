// This file contains a number of optional features that disable VC
// warnings regarding various items that VC turned into warnings that were
// not present in earlier versions. Some people may consider these superfluous
// or have already checked code to be sure it causes no trouble. So these
// warnings are disabled by default. To enable them, generate your projects
// with the feature set to 0.
