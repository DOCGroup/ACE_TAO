# This is for HP-UX 11.x using the aC++ compiler.
#
# HP-UX 11 supports both 32-bit and 64-bit builds, regardless of which
# architecture the build is done on.  This file is set up to build native
# to the machine it's running on.  To cross-build for another platform, add
# "buildbits=32" to make a 32-bit build, and "buildbits=64" to do a 64-bit
# build.  Note that if you explicitly specify a 64-bit build, the option
#  -Wl,+vnocompatwarnings is added to shut up the "At least one PA 2.0 object
# file detected..." messages.
