# This file should allow to build ACE for mingw32 with mingw tools.
# Edit to change TCPU below.
#
# Don't forget to define the ACE_ROOT environment variable!

# mingw32 packages as distributed from sourceforge:
# http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&release_id=15084
# See also http://www.mingw.org.
#
# You will also need a GNU Make for win32 (so you can actualy
# USE this file :-). Tested with MSYS from MinGW
#
# Caveat:
#
#   If ld complains about not finding crt2.o, dllcrt2.o or gcrt2.o
#   when linking executables, you will need to modify the specs file for gcc:
# 	lib/gcc-lib/mingw32/2.95.2/specs
#   look for the line after the one begining ``*startfile:'', and add
#   full path as prefix for crt2, dllcrt2 and gcrt2
#   (i.e., change
#    ... %{!shared:%{!mdll:crt2%O%s}} ...
#    with
#    ... %{!shared:%{!mdll:c:/mingw32/lib/gcc-lib/mingw32/2.95.2/crt2%O%s}} ...
#    or something similar depending on the location of your instalation).

#
# Chose your target CPU (by default we set it to pentiumpro. In your
# platform_macros.GNU file you can override this to pentium, i486 or i386
#

# MingW doesn't allow to add the version number of ACE to the dll name
