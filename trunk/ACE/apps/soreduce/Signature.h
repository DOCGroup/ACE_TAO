// Signature class encapsulates a single line of nm output. This line may be 
// either an "undefined" name to be resolved, or text or data which resolves 
// the unknowns. Some of the features of the Signature class are currently 
// unused, such as owner_, which is anticipation of analysis that may lead to 
// further code reduction. The premise being that unresolved symbols that are 
// defined within otherwise unused code should not be resolved. However this 
// information is not available in the output of nm. Further research is 
// required.
// 
// Signatures are reference counted to avoid duplication.
