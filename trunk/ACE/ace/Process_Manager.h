/**
 * @class ACE_Process_Manager
 *
 * @brief Manages a group of processes.
 *
 * This class allows applications to control groups of processes,
 * similar to how the \<ACE_Thread_Manager\> controls groups of
 * threads.  Naturally, it doesn't work at all on platforms, such
 * as VxWorks or pSoS, that don't support process.
 * There are two (main) ways of using \<ACE_Process_Manager\>,
 * depending on how involved you wish to be with the termination
 * of managed <ACE_Process>es.  If you just want <Process>es to
 * go away when they're finished, simply register the
 * <Process_Manager> with an \<ACE_Reactor\>:
 * ACE_Process_Manager mgr( 100, some_reactor )
 * -or-
 * ACE_Process_Manager mgr;
 * ...
 * mgr.open( 100, some_reactor );
 * Then, the <Process_Manager> will clean up after any
 * <Process>es that it spawns.  (On Unix, this means executing a
 * wait(2) to collect the exit status -- and avoid zombie
 * processes; on Win32, it means closing the process and thread
 * HANDLEs that are created when CreateProcess is called.)
 * If, on the other hand (and for some inexplicable reason) you
 * want to explicitly invoke the terminated <Process> cleanup
 * code, then *don't* register the <Process_Manager> with a
 * Reactor, and be sure to call one of the
 * <Process_Manager::wait> functions whenever there might be
 * managed <Process>es that have exited.
 * Note that in either case, <Process_Manager> allows you to
 * register "<Event_Handlers>" to be called when a specific
 * <Process> exits, or when any <Process> without a specific
 * <Event_Handler> exits.  When a <Process> exits, the
 * appropriate <Event_Handler>'s <handle_input> is called; the
 * ACE_HANDLE passed is either the Process' HANDLE (on Win32),
 * or its pid cast to an ACE_HANDLE (on unix).
 * It is also possible to call the <Process_Manager::wait>
 * functions even though the <Process_Manager> is registered with
 * a <Reactor>.
 * Note also that the wait functions are "sloppy" on Unix,
 * because there's no good way to wait for a subset of the
 * children of a process.  The wait functions may end up
 * collecting the exit status of a process that's not managed by
 * the <Process_Manager> whose <wait> you invoked.  It's best to
 * only use a single <Process_Manager>, and to create all
 * subprocesses by calling that <Process_Manager>'s <spawn>
 * method.
 * Incidentally, when you register your <Process_Manager> with a
 * <Reactor> its notification pipe is used to help "reap" the
 * available exit statuses.  Therefore, you must not use a
 * <Reactor> whose notify pipe has been disabled.  Here's the
 * sequence of steps used to reap the exit statuses in this case:
 * + The <Process_Manager> registers a signal handler for
 *   SIGCHLD.
 * + The SIGCHLD handler, when invoked, uses the <Reactor>'s
 *   <notify> method to inform the <Reactor> to wake up.
 * + Next, the <Reactor> calls the <Process_Manager>'s
 *   <handle_input>, this happens synchronously, not in
 *   sighandler-space.
 * + The <handle_input> method collects all available exit
 *   statuses.
