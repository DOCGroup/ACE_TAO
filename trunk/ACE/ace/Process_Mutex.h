/**
 * @class ACE_Process_Mutex
 *
 * @brief A wrapper for mutexes that can be used across processes on
 * the same host machine, as well as within a process, of
 * course.
 *
 * @attention The mechanism upon which @c ACE_Process_Mutex is based
 * can be configured at build time to be either @c ACE_SV_Semaphore_Complex
 * (on platforms that support it) or @c ACE_Mutex. On platforms that
 * require interprocess mutexes be allocated from shared memory (Pthreads
 * and UI Threads are examples), @c ACE_SV_Semaphore_Complex provides a
 * more reliable mechanism for implementing inter-process mutex than
 * @c ACE_Mutex. However, at least on some platforms,
 * @c ACE_SV_Semaphore_Complex is limited to a small number of
 * objects by the underlying System V IPC kernel parameters. If you
 * want to force use of @c ACE_Mutex as the underlying mechanism, set
 * @c ACE_USES_MUTEX_FOR_PROCESS_MUTEX in your @c config.h file.
 * Also, if you require the ability to do a timed @c acquire(), you must
 * set @c ACE_USES_MUTEX_FOR_PROCESS_MUTEX, as timed acquire does not
 * work with System V semaphores.
 * @attention Currently there is also the operational difference between
 * pthreads and semaphores based @c. For semaphore base @c the semaphore
 * is destroyed after the last instance of @c in OS. In contrary, pthread based
 * @c is destroyed when the owner, namely the process which created the
 * first instance of @c destroys the mutex. For protable applications it is better
 * to always ensure that the owner of the mutex destroys it after the
 * other processes.
