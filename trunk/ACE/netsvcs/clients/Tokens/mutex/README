test_mutex

test_mutex tests ACE_Local_Mutex and ACE_Remote_Mutex with both local
and global proxies.  "Local proxies" mean that each thread uses its
own proxy (but same logical token.)  "Global proxy" means that all
threads access the same proxy (and, of course, the same logical
token.)

test_mutex can take the number of threads to run from the
command-line.  Thus, to run the test with one thread and local
mutexes, type:

% ./test_mutex

To run the test with 10 threads and local mutexes, type:

% ./test_mutex -t 10

To run the test with 10 threads and remote mutexes, type:

% ./test_mutex -t 10 -r
