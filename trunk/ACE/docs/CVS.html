This page contains the minimum (and then some) commands necessary to
access and update <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a>
through <a href="file:/project/doc/pkg/cvs/cvs-1.10/doc/cvs.ps">CVS</a>
version control.  The intended audience is local ACE developers, so
it's not by any means a general introduction to CVS.  And some HTML
links and other references are local only.<p>

The information here is based on CVS versions 1.9 and 1.10.5 and later.<p>

Notes to emacs users: the emacs Tools/Version Control (or vc) pulldown
has CVS commands:  it's well worth checking out.  And, see the
<a href="#Preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> section for a handy
addition to your .emacs file.<p>

If you'd like to update your CVS workspace remotely, see
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~nanbor/">Nanbor Wang</a>'s&nbsp&nbsp
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~nanbor/CVSUP/">CVSup</a>&nbsp page.<p>

Please <a href="mailto:levine@cs.wustl.edu">email me</a> any corrections or

<h3>1. <a name="The Model">The Model</a></h3>
The following terms are used in the discussion in this web page:<br>
<ul>
  <li><em>Repository</em>: The master store of all versions of all
    controlled files.<p>
  <li><em>Workspace</em>: A user's collection of controlled files.
    The user may modify these files at will.<p>
  <li><em>Check out</em>: Retrieve one or more files from the
    repository, and place them in a workspace.  Any version of any
    file may be retrieved; typically, that will be the latest version.<p>
  <li><em>Check in, or commit</em>: Update the latest version of
    one or more files in the repository.  This is done from a workspace.<p>
  <li><em>Module</em>: Directory.
</ul>

Our use of CVS fits into the
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~levine/ACE_wrappers/docs/ACE-development-process.html">ACE development process</a>.<p>


<hr><p>
<h3>2. <a name="Preliminaries">Preliminaries</a></h3>
<p>The <code>CVSROOT</code> environment variable listed below is <font
color=red> <strong><blink>required</blink></strong></font>.  If you
want to use CVS from within emacs, you'll have to restart it from a
shell that has <code>CVSROOT</code> defined.<p>

Emacs users might want to add <var>(setq vc-follow-symlinks t)</var>
to your .emacs file to instruct emacs to follow symlinks to
version-controlled plain files.<p>

For lack of a better place to put the following, I'll put it here.
It's a good idea to insert a CVS/RCS keyword string at the top of
every file that you place under CVS control.  This includes source
files, Makefiles, config files, <em>etc</em>.  It will embed in the
file a concise record of the filename, last update time, revision
number, and last user who updated it.  For C++ files, the keyword
string is:
  <pre>
  // $<!-- -->Id$
  </pre>
It's not necessary to fill in the fields of the keyword string,
or modify them when you edit a file that already has one.  CVS
does that automatically when you checkout or update the file.<p>

On Unix systems, you might want to create a file called <code>.cvsrc</code>
in your home directory with the following contents:
<pre><code>
co -P
update -P
</code></pre>
That will cause CVS to prune empty directories on checkout or update.
<p>

<h3>3. <a name="Getting started with ACE on CVS">Getting started with ACE on CVS</a></h3>
Note:  the first three steps are for UNIX platforms.  See the
<a href="#Windows NT setup">Windows NT setup</a> section for
setup information for Windows NT.
<ol>
  <li>% <code>setenv CVSROOT /project/cvs-repository </code> ####
      site-specific location<p>
  <li>cd to the directory that you want your ACE_wrappers workspace
      to be under.<p>
  <li>% <code>setenv ACE_ROOT `pwd` </code> #### to set the ACE_ROOT
      environment<p>
  <li>Change your umask to something like 022 <strong>if</strong> you want
      others to be able to view your workspace.<p>
  <li>% <code>cvs checkout ACE_wrappers</code><p>
  <li>Add the ace/config.h and include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
      symlinks.  For example, for Sun C++ on SunOS 5.5:
      <pre><code>
      % ln -s config-sunos5.5.h ace/config.h
      % ln -s platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
      </code></pre><p>
  <li>Hack away in your own workspace.  All files have user write
      permission.
</ol><p>


<hr><p>
<h3>4. <a name="Windows NT setup">Windows NT setup</a></h3>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~brunsch/">Darrell Brunsch</a>
and <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~irfan/">Irfan Pyarali</a> for
providing this NT setup information.  (It contains a site-specific
<code>CVSROOT</code>.)<p>

You can use the CVS client under Windows NT to keep a local repository
of ACE.  To set it up, follow these steps:<P>
<ol>
  <li>Find or create a directory in your path (I just created a utils
      directory and added it to my path).<p>
  <li>Download the files cvs.exe, patch.exe, and win32gnu.dll.  They're
      in a zip file on
      <a href="http://download.cyclic.com/pub/cvs-1.10.5/windows/">Cyclic
      Software's download site.</a>  (Cyclic Software hsa been acquired
      by SourceGear Corporation.)<p>

      Alternatively, <a href="http://www.wincvs.org">WinCVS</a> provides
      a graphical front-end on Windows.  <strong>NOTE: </strong>if
      you use WinCVS, beware that it enables read-only checkout by
      default.  So be sure not to check out that way if you want to
      edit files.<p>

      Thanks to <a href="http://www.riverace.com">Steve Huston</a> for that
      note.<p>
  <li>Be sure that the <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS">SourceGear</a>
      cvs utilities precede any
      <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">Cygnus
      GNU-Win32 utilities</a> in your path, something like this:<p>

      <pre>
      d:\utilities\cvs;D:\utilities\gnuwin32\b18\H-i386-cygwin32\bin
      </pre>
  <li>Add to your environment: <BR>
      <code>LOGNAME = </code><em>username</em><br>
      <code>CVSROOT = ace.cs.wustl.edu:/project/cvs-repository</code><br>
</ol>
Please note that this approach uses a remote shell.  So, your
account must be able to rsh to the server machine.<p>

For an alternative approach that uses CVS pserver instead of rsh,
please see Darrell's <a
href="http://tao.cs.wustl.edu/howto/use_win32_pserver.html">CVS
pserver page for Win32</a>.<p>


<hr><p>
<h3>5. <a name="Checking in changes">Checking in changes</a></h3>
By convention, any repository change should be documented in
an appropriate ChangeLog.  The ChangeLog entry should start with
a line of this form:
<pre>
  ChangeLogTag: <em>date</em>  <em>name</em>  &lt;<em>email address</em>&gt;
</pre><p>

In all examples below, <code>ChangeLog</code> refers to appropriate
ChangeLog.<p>

<h4>5.1. Command line</h4>
    To enter your workspace changes into the master repository from
    the command line::<p>
<pre>
    % cvs commit -m "ChangeLogTag: `head -1 ChangeLog`" <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em> ChangeLog
</pre><p>

<h4>5.2. From emacs</h4>
    To checkin one file or directory to the repository:<p>
<ol>
  <li><code>C-x v v </code>(vc-next-action) to check the file or directory
       in<p>
  <li>Insert the ChangeLogTag, using the first line of your ChangeLog entry<p>
  <li><code>C-c C-c </code> to finish checkin
</ol><p>


<hr><p>
<h3>6. <a name="Workspace update">Workspace update</a></h3>
To update your workspace from the master repository, to pick up changes
by others:<p>
   <blockquote>% <code>cvs update ACE_wrappers</code></blockquote><p>

cvs will print out a line for each directory that it enters
(by default, it will recurse through the directory tree; to
disable this and only update one directory, add <code>-l</code>
after <code>update</code>).<p>

cvs will print out a line for each file that differs from what is
in the repository.  This first character indicates the file status:
<ul>
  <li><code>U</code> the file was brought <strong>up-to-date</strong>, so
                     now it agrees with what is in the repository
  <li><code>P</code> same as <code>U</code>, except used by CVS server
                     when it sends a patch instead of the entire file
  <li><code>M</code> the file is <strong>modified</strong> in your
                     workspace with respect to the repository; without any
                     other message, it means that the file was not modified
                     by this update operation.  If changes were
                     successfully merged (without conflict), then cvs will
                     note on the previous lines.
  <li><code>C</code> the file needs to be updated, but a
                     <strong>conflict</strong> was detected.  The file now
                     contains the differences, demarcated with
                     <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and
                     <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.  The
                     unmodified file was moved to <em>.#file.revision</em>.
                     You'll need to edit the file to resolve the
                     differences.  I get a lot of false positives on files
                     that I know I didn't modify locally:  for those cases,
                     I just remove the file and rerun update.
  <li><code>A</code> or <code>R</code> The file has been
                     <strong>added</strong> or <strong>removed</strong>
                     to/from your workspace, but the add or
                     remove has not yet been committed.
  <li><code>?</code> the file is <strong>private</strong> to your
                     workspace:  it does not exist in the repository
</ul>

To show what update would do to the currently directory (recursively),
without actually doing it:
<blockquote>% <code>cvs -n update <strong>.</strong></code></blockquote>
<blockquote>
  The -q option to update suppresses the ``Updating'' message for each
  directory:
  <blockquote>%
              <code>cvs -nq update <strong>.</strong></code></blockquote>
</blockquote>

To get the status of the current directory (recursively) with respect to
the repository:
<blockquote>% <code>cvs status <strong>.</strong></code></blockquote>

To get the status of a single file with respect to the repository,
with symbolic tags displayed:
<blockquote>% <code>cvs status -v <em>file</em></code></blockquote>

To show local (in current workspace) changes to one or more files,
relative to the versions that they were checked out from:
<blockquote>% <code>cvs diff <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em></code>
</blockquote>

To show local (in current workspace) changes to one or more files,
relative to the latest versions in the repository:
<blockquote>% <code>cvs diff -rHEAD <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em></code>
</blockquote><p>


<hr><p>
<h3>7. <a name="Adding/removing files/directories">Adding/removing files/directories</a></h3>
Adding one or more text files requires two steps:
<pre>
    % cvs add <em>file . . .</em>
    % cvs commit <em>file . . .</em>
</pre><br>
The commit may be done later, on the entire directory, etc.
Note that cvs <strong>add</strong> is not recursive, so
that the files in each directory of a hierarchy must be
added in separate commands.  Also, only files in the current
directory can be added.<p>

Binary files require the <code>-kb</code> option to <code>cvs add</code>:
<pre>
    % cvs add -kb <em>file . . .</em>
    % cvs commit <em>file . . .</em>
</pre><br>
If not applied during the <code>add</code> operation, <code>-kb</code>
can be applied using <code>cvs admin -kb</code>.<p>

Removing files is similar, except the cvs <strong>remove</strong>
command is used instead of the <strong>add</strong> command:
<pre>
    % cvs remove <em>file . . .</em>
    % cvs commit <em>file . . .</em>
</pre><p>

An add of an empty directory doesn't require a commit.<p>

Removing a directory is more problematic.  There is no CVS command to
remove (or rename) a directory:  it has to be done behind CVS' back,
directly in the repository.  This is by design; a CVS command can't be
used to irrevocably destroy information.  Therefore, never remove a
directory.  You can safely remove all of the files in it, using the
above steps.

To just remove a directory from a workspace (without removing it from
the repository):  first, remove the directory and all of its files
using usual OS commands.  Second, run
<pre>
    % cvs update -P <em>directory-path </em>
</pre><br>
to prune the directory from the workspace.<p>


<hr><p>
<h3>8. <a name="Modules">Modules</a></h3>
Instead of referring to ``ACE_wrappers'' above, you can refer
to a module, such as ace, tests, performance-tests, and so on.
To get a list of known modules, use the -c option to checkout:
<blockquote>% <code>cvs checkout -c</code></blockquote><p>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:  if a subdirectory is added to ACE, it
<strong>must</strong> be added to the list of known modules in
<code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules</code>!  If you don't want to edit that
file, please tell <a href="mailto:levine@cs.wustl.edu">David</a>.  The
<code>CVSROOT</code> files are under RCS control.  emacs' VC tools
handle them the same way that they handle CVS-controlled files.  So,
you can check them out and back in with <code>C-x v v</code>.<p>

To add an entirely new module:
<ol>
  <li>Create the directories/files.<p>
  <li>Add the module to <code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules</code>, as
      mentioned above.<p>
  <li>Create a new directory in <code>$CVSROOT</code>, owned by the appropriate
      group and with sufficient (probably group write+setuid) permissions.<p>
  <li>Change to the directory just above the top-level directory for
      the module in your workspace.<p>
  <li><code>cvs checkout <em>new module name</em></code><p>
  <li>Add all of the new directories/files in the module, as described
      <a href="#Adding/removing files/directories">above</a>, then commit.
</ol>


<hr><p>
<h3>9. <a name="ChangeLog updates">ChangeLog updates</a></h3>
To automatically update the ChangeLog, use the emacs command:
<pre>
  C-u C-x v a
</pre>
Thanks to James Hu &lt;jxh@cs.wustl.edu&gt; for this useful tidbit.<p>

To set a specific host address in your ChangeLog entries, add a line
like this to your <code>~/.emacs</code>:
<pre>
  (setq mail-host-address "cs.wustl.edu")
</pre><p>

To set a specific name in your ChangeLog entries, add a line like
this to your <code>~/.emacs</code>:
<pre>
  (setq user-full-name "my full name")
</pre>
Otherwise, CVS uses the name (GECOS field) from your passwd entry.<p>


<hr><p>
<h3>10. <a name="File revisions">File revisions</a></h3>
File revisions in and below the current directory may be tagged with:
<pre>
    % cvs tag <em>tag</em> <strong>.</strong>
</pre><p>

To retrieve an old revision of a file, use the -r option to cvs
<strong>update</strong>:
<pre>
    % cvs update -r<em>tag file</em>
</pre>
The revision tags of a file can be viewed
with the cvs <strong>log</strong> command.<p>

Or, to retrieve the file and/or directory versions as of a
certain date and time, use the -D option to cvs <strong>update</strong>,
for example:
<pre>
    % cvs update -D "last Saturday" OS.{h,i,cpp}
</pre>

<strong>NOTE:  </strong>The -r and -D options are ``sticky''; they will
apply to the file(s)/directories until overwritten with another revision
tag or date, or until disabled.
They are disabled by using the update -A option, which also checks out
the latest revision:
<pre>
    % cvs update -A <em>file</em>
</pre><p>

To change the log message for a particular revision of a file:<p>
<pre>
    % cvs admin -m<em>revision</em>:"<em>new message</em>" <em>file</em>
</pre><p>


<hr><p>
<h3>11. <a name="File reversion">File reversion</a></h3>
There are a few ways to revert a file to the last revision that is in
the repository, if you want to abandon your changes to it:

<ul>
  <li>The easiest way to abandon your changes <strong>in your
    workspace</strong> is to use the emacs command <code>C-x v u </code>
    (vc-revert-buffer).  Or from the shell, you could remove the
    file and update it with <code>cvs update <em>file</em></code>.<p>

  <li><strong>Do not remove a revision from the cvs repository
    directly.</strong> To revert a revision that you made, use the
    following command to revert the change in your workspace and
    check in the reverted version:
<pre>
    % cvs update -j<em>after_change</em> -j<em>before_change</em> <em>file</em>
</pre>
    For example, if the version containing the version you want to
    revert is 4.10, then, <em>after_change</em> should be
    <code>4.10</code> and <em>before_change</em> should be
    <code>4.9</code>.<p>

    <strong>NOTE:</strong> this doesn't seem to work with CVS version 1.10.<p>

    Make sure the patch succeeded (if you are not reverting a change
    you made long time ago, most likely it will succeed) before
    checking in the reverted version.<p>

    Also make sure the you add a ChangeLog entry explaining why
    you reverted the change.
</ul>

<hr><p>
<h3>12. <a name="Renaming a file">Renaming a file</a></h3>
There are three ways to rename a CVS-controlled file.  The first
preserves the revision log, but it must be accessed by either the
original or new name, depending on what you want to see.  And
revision numbers will start over at 1.0 unless set with the
<code>-r</code> option.  It's all done in the user's workspace:
<pre>
    Add ChangeLog entry containing:
    Renamed <em>OLD</em> to <em>NEW</em>
    % mv <em>OLD</em> <em>NEW</em>
    % cvs remove <em>OLD</em>
    % cvs add <em>NEW</em>
    % cvs commit -m "ChangeLogTag: `head -1 ChangeLog`" <em>OLD</em> <em>NEW</em> ChangeLog
</pre><br>

The second method maintains the revision log in one place and the
revision number sequence.  It makes fetching old releases of the
module more difficult, which may be an advantage or disadvantage
depending on local circumstances.  It is more dangerous because the
repository is modified directly; see the warning in the cvs info page
about other users accessing the history file while it is being moved:
<pre>
    % cd $CVSROOT/<em>MODULE</em>
    % mv <em>OLD</em>,v <em>NEW</em>,v
</pre><br>

The third method is to copy the history file in the repository.
Instead of moving the history file, as in the second method above,
copy it.  It's not necessary to prevent others from accessing the
file.  The cvs info pages show other steps, to remove the old tags
from the new history file.  While technically correct, I don't think
that's necessary for our purposes.<p>

While the first method is the safest, it has the distinct disadvantage
of hindering access of old versions.  If that's not a problem for a
particular file, then it is the preferred approach.  As Carlos would
probably say if you asked him, ``it's the right thing to do.''<p>

If easy access to old versions is desired, I would use the third
approach:  copy the history file in the repository.<p>


<hr><p>
<h3>13. <a name="Local version control">Local version control</a></h3>
All version control with CVS is done through the master repository.
CVS doesn't provide any facility for local checkpoints.  If you want
local version control in your workspace, there's nothing to stop you
from using RCS or SCCS locally (but it might confuse emacs' version
control).  The preferred approach is to create a branch, and
checkpoint as much as you want on that branch.  When the time comes to
make the changes public, just merge the branch.  See the <a
href="#Branches">Branches</a> section of this page, and the cvs man
page, for instructions on creating and using a branch.<p>


<hr><p>
<h3>14. <a name="Branches">Branches</a></h3>
To create a branch, you must first create a tag to identify the
branch.  Then, you can checkout on that branch.  There are various
ways to go about doing this, but these steps show how when starting
from scratch:

<pre>
    % cvs rtag -b <em>branch_tag</em> <em>module(s)</em>
    % cvs checkout -r <em>branch_tag</em> <em>module(s)</em>
</pre>

It's not necessary to checkout all the files in a directory or module
on the branch, but it's probably the easiest and least confusing
approach in the long run.  <strong>Note</strong> that it's usually
tricky to tag individual files on a branch because CVS won't
be able to identify which module they're in.  By way of example,
to checkout just <code>ace/OS.h</code> on a branch, you'd have to do
this, assuming that you're already in the <code>ace</code> directory:
<pre>
    % cd ..
    % cvs rtag -b <em>branch_tag</em> ace/OS.h
    % cvs checkout -r <em>branch_tag</em> ace/OS.h
    % cd ace
</pre>
This can be done after modifying files, and CVS will retain your
modifications.  However, if you don't trust CVS, it's best to backup
your files first.<p>

Checkouts on a branch are sticky, and will apply until the head
version of the file(s) have been checked out with the <code>-A</code>
option to <code>cvs update</code>.  Presumably, this will be done
after merging the branch to the main trunk.  See the
<a href="#Old file revisions">Old file revisions</a> section of this
page for similar discussion of sticky tags.<p>

To merge an entire branch to the main trunk, use the <code>-j</code>
(for <em>join</em>) option to <code>cvs checkout</code>.  That just
merges in your workspace; the repository can then be updated from the
workspace using <code>commit</code> as usual:
<pre>
    Add ChangeLog entry containing:
    merged <em>branch_tag</em>
    % cvs checkout -P -Aj <em>branch_tag</em> <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em>
    % cvs commit -m "ChangeLogTag: `head -1 ChangeLog`" <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em> ChangeLog
</pre>
(The <code>-A</code> is needed if you are in the workspace that has
the checkouts on the branch.  It updates the workspace to the latest
versions on the main trunk.  So, <strong>don't</strong> use it if
you want to keep working on the branch.)<p>

To merge any changes on the main trunk to a branch, the first time:
<pre>
    Add ChangeLog entry containing:
    merged main trunk changes
    % cvs update -jHEAD <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em>
    % cvs commit -m "ChangeLogTag: `head -1 ChangeLog`" <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em> ChangeLog
    % cvs tag <em>merged_foo_branch</em> <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em>
</pre>

<strong>AFTER MERGING, APPLY A LABEL TO THE SOURCE BRANCH,
as shown above.</strong>
For example, if you merged from the main trunk to a branch,
apply a new label to the main trunk.  You can use that label
later to merge any subsequent changes on the main trunk.  The
<code>cvs</code> info pages have a good example of this.
Briefly:

<pre>
    Add ChangeLog entry containing:
    merged main trunk changes
    % cvs update -j<em>merged_foo_branch</em> -jHEAD <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em>
    % cvs commit -m "ChangeLogTag: `head -1 ChangeLog`" <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em> ChangeLog
    % cvs tag <em>merged_foo_branch_again</em> <em>file(s)/directori(es)</em>
</pre>


Note that any files created on the branch won't be visible on
the main trunk, even after the merge.  I'm not sure of right
way to take care of this, but I follow these steps for each
file created on the branch:<p>
<ol>
  <li>In the repository, move the RCS file from the <var>Attic</var>
      directory up to its parent directory.
  <li>Edit the RCS file, replacing the "dead" state with "Exp".
  <li>Merge from the branch to the main trunk:
    <pre>
      Add ChangeLog entry containing:
      merged <em>branch_tag</em>
      % cvs update -Aj <em>branch_tag</em> <em>file</em>
      % cvs commit -m "ChangeLogTag: `head -1 ChangeLog`" <em>file</em> ChangeLog
    </pre>
</ol>

To create a file on a branch, in a directory that has not been
checked out on the branch:
<ol>
  <li>Add the file and commit it to the main branch
  <li>Create the branch tag on the file, and check the file out
    on the branch.
  <li>Remove the file, cvs remove the file, and commit the removal.
  <li>Check the file out on the branch.
</ol>
Alternatively, the recommended procedure is to simply check the
entire directory out on the branch, then create the file.<p>

In general, deleting branch tags is not recommended.  But it's often
necessary, especially when getting started with branches.  The
<code>-d</code> option to <code>cvs rtag</code> can be used to delete
a branch tag.<p>

The use of a branch for maintaining a release is illustrated
in the section on the <a href="#ACE release bug-fix branch">ACE
release bug-fix branch</a>.<p>

<h3>15. <a name="Remote repositories">Remote repositories</a></h3>
Before setting up a repository for remote access, be sure to see
the <a href="file:/project/doc/pkg/cvs/cvs-1.10/doc/cvs.ps">CVS
documentation</a>.  There are important security considerations.<p>

An easy way to access a remote repository is via rsh.  These steps
ought to get you going:
<ol>
  <li>Install cvs on the local system, if it doesn't already have it.<p>
  <li>Add yourself to an <code>.rhosts</code> file on the remote machine
      of a user that can access the repository.<p>
  <li>Set your <code>CVSROOT</code> environment variable to:<br>
        <pre>
          <em>remote user</em>@<em>remote host</em>:<em>remote repository</em>
        </pre>
</ol>
Then, you can issue cvs commands just as you would on the remote machine.<p>

If you have ssh on your client machine, you can use ssh instead of
rsh.  Just set your <code>CVS_RSH</code> environment variable to
<code>ssh</code>.  You don't need to add an <code>.rhosts</code>
entry with ssh, so it's the best alternative for remote repository
access.<p>

Another way to access to remote cvs repository is to run cvs in
client-server mode.  To use this feature, first check if you have your
<code>HOME</code> environment variable set properly.  Then, set your
<code>CVSROOT</code> to:<p>
<pre>
        :pserver:your_user_id@ace.cs.wustl.edu:/project/cvs-repository
</pre><p>
Then, do a cvs login as
<pre>
    % cvs login
</pre><p>
Type in your password when CVS prompts you to enter your password.
This will create a file call "<code>.cvspass</code>" in your home
directory (as defined by <code>$HOME</code>) that contains the
encripted password for the server.  You can now perform regular CVS
operation directly.<p>

<strong>Notice:</strong> It's not difficult to decode the passwords in
<code>.cvspass</code> file.  Therefore, never use cvs in client-server
mode in a unsafe environment.  (Where others can read your .cvspass
file.)<p>

To speed up client-server mode operations, it might help to use
the <code>cvs</code> <code>-z</code> option.  It requires that
<code>gzip</code> be on your search path on both the client and
server.  An example use is:<p>
<pre>
    % cvs -z 1 update
</pre><p>

and <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~brunsch/">Darrell Brunsch</a>
for figuring out and providing this documentation for cvs
client-server mode.<p>

<h3>16. <a name="Exporting from CVS">Exporting from CVS</a></h3>
There are two different strategies for exporting CVS-controlled files,
such as for code releases.  The first, preferred approach is to use
the cvs <strong>export</strong> command to stage a version of the
controlled files to a non-controlled directory.  This version will
not have any of the CVS files in it.  THe second approach is to
create a release from a user's CVS-controlled workspace.<p>

To use cvs <strong>export</strong>, either a date or revision
tag must be specified.  It's usually a good idea to tag the sources
with a revision tag and use that.  So, the steps would be:<br>
<pre>
    % cd <em>root of directory tree</em>
    % cvs tag <em>tag</em> <strong>.</strong>
    % cd <em>staging directory</em>
    % cvs export -r <em>tag</em>
    % find . -print | cpio -o -H tar | gzip -9 &gt; <em>tar filename</em>
</pre>

To tag and create a release in the form of a gzip'ped tar file
from a user's workspace:
<pre>
    % cd <em>root of directory tree</em>
    % cvs tag <em>tag</em> <strong>.</strong>
    % find . -name CVS -prune -o -print | cpio -o -H tar | gzip -9 &gt; <em>tar filename</em>
</pre>

The relative advantage of the first, export approach is that you will
be sure that only CVS-controlled files will be released.  However, it
requires the extra step and creation of the staging area.<p>

This extra step is one reason why we don't currently stage releases of
ACE.  Instead, they are built from Doug's personal workspace.  That
workspace is visible on the web, so that ACE users can track the very
latest changes without any explicit action by Doug.  If we were to
stage it, to make any change visible would require an explicit move to
the staging area.<p>

<h3>17. <a name="ACE_wrappers-frozen workspace">ACE_wrappers-frozen workspace</a></h3>

This section applies to the DOC group at Wash. U. only:<p>

There's now a ``frozen'' ACE in
<strong>/project/cvs-repository/ACE_wrappers-frozen/</strong>.
It contains the latest official release of ACE.<p>

There are complete g++ 2.7.2.1 and Sun C++ 4.2 builds in the
<strong>build</strong> directory below the directory noted above.
To use one of these builds, set or prepend to these environment variables:<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<th>Compiler</th>
<th>set <strong>WRAPPER_ROOT</strong> to:</th>
<th>prepend to <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>:</th>
<tr>
<td>g++</td>

<h3>18. <a name="ACE release bug-fix branch">ACE release bug-fix branch</a></h3>

This section applies to the DOC group at Wash. U. only:<p>

The ``main line'' CVS branch will (continue to) be the ``new features''
branch.  If you want the very latest and greatest ACE at all times, no
changes to the use of your workspace are required.  Just
<code>cvs update</code> it as usual.<p>

Bug fixes to the official release will go on a branch.  For the ACE
4.2 release, for example, this branch is name
<strong>ACE-4_2</strong>.  (CVS does not allow periods in branch names
or any other tags.)  To use it, do this in your workspace:
<pre>
    % cd ..
    % cvs checkout -r ACE-4_2 ACE_wrappers
</pre>

From that point on, all updates and commits in that workspace
will be from/to the <strong>ACE-4_2</strong> branch.<p>

<dl>
<blockquote>

  <dt><pre>cvs update: conflict: <em>foo </em>is modified but no longer in the repository<br>
U <em>bar</em></pre>
  <dd>That might indicate that file <em>foo</em> was renamed to <em>bar</em>.
      If so, <em>foo</em> should be removed from the current workspace.  (And
      that warning will not reoccur for the workspace, because its CVS will
      have removed <em>foo</em> from the workspace entries and checked out
      <em>bar</em>.)<p>

  <dt><pre>cvs update: [<em>time</em>] waiting for <em>user</em>'s lock in <em>repository</em></pre>
  <dd>Check for lock files and directories in the <code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT</code>
      and lock files anywhere in the <code>$CVSROOT</code> hierarchy.  Remove
      ones that no longer appear to be in use and retry.  Lock files and
      directories have names starting with ``.#'', I think.<p>

  <dt>Why does a file in the repository not have group and/or other read
      permission?<p>
  <dd>Because it didn't have those permissions when it was added to the
      repository.  To fix it, those permissions can be added to the ,v file in
      the repository.  To avoid it, those permissions should be added to the
      file before it is created/committed the first time.<p>

  <dt>Why does CVS keep removing group/and or other read permission from a
      file in my workspace?<p>
  <dd>Because your umask is something like 7 or 77.  Change it to something
      like 22.  If you don't want to change it for everything, then alias cvs;
      in t/csh:<br>
      <blockquote>% <code>alias cvs '(umask 22; \cvs \!*)'</code></blockquote>
      <p>
      Also, the file will have to have mode 644 before you commit it.  So if
      your editor removes group/other read permission, you'll have to ``fix''
      that as well.<p>

  <dt>I modified Makefile in my workspace so I don't build static or shared
      ACE libraries.  But, I forgot about it and commited the modified
      Makefile to the repository.  Help?<p>
  <dd>You'll have to correct the Makefile and commit your corrections.<p>

      Instead of modifying your makefile, try these commands to build the
      ACE static and shared libraries, respectively:
      <blockquote>% make <code>static_libs_only=1</code></blockquote>

      <blockquote>% make <code>shared_libs_only=1</code></blockquote>

</blockquote>
