<h3>ACE Software Development Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>General</strong><p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every text file must end with a newline.<p>

    <li>Use spaces instead of tabs, except in Makefiles.  Emacs users
        can add this to their <strong>.emacs</strong>:

        <pre>(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)</pre></p>

        Microsoft Visual C++ users should do the following:

        <pre>
        Choose:  Tools -- Options -- Tabs
        Then Set:  "Tab size" to 8 and "Indent size" to 2, and
        indent using spaces.
        </pre><p>

    <li>Do not end text lines with spaces.  Emacs users can add this to
        their <strong>.emacs</strong>:

        <pre>(setq-default nuke-trailing-whitespace-p t)</pre>

        <strong>Note for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Users:</strong>
        <p>There is a macro project <code>(ace_guidelines.vsmacros)</code>
        located in <code>$ACE_ROOT/docs</code> that replaces tabs with spaces
        and removes trailing spaces each time you save a file.</p>

    <li>Try to limit the length of source code lines to less than 80
        characters.  Users with 14 inch monitors appreciate it when
        reading code.  And, it avoids mangling problems with email
        and net news.<p>

        <li>Try to avoid creating files with excessively long names (45 characters).
        Moreover, ensure that the names of generated files e.g. <code>MakeProjectCreator</code>,
        <code>tao_idl</code> do not also go beyond that limit. Some operating
        systems cannot handle very long file names correctly.<p>

    <li>If you add a comment to code that is directed to, or
        requires the attention of, a particular individual:
        <strong>SEND EMAIL TO THAT INDIVIDUAL!</strong>.<p>

    <li>Every program should have a "usage" message.  It should be
        printed out if erroneous command line arguments, or a
        <strong><code>-?</code></strong> command line argument, are
        provided to the program.<p>

    <li>An ACE-using program's entry point should use the portable form:
        <pre>
        int ACE_TMAIN (int argc, ACE_TCHAR *argv[])
        </pre>
        This form is portable to all ACE platforms whether using narrow
        or wide characters. The other two common forms:
        <pre>
        int main (int argc, char *argv[])
        int wmain (int argc, wchar_t *argv[])
        </pre>
        as well as any other main entrypoint form should only be used
        when there is some overarching reason to not use the portable form.
        One example would be a Windows GUI program that requires WinMain.
        <p>See <a href="wchar.txt"><code>$ACE_ROOT/docs/wchar.txt</code></a>
        for more information on ACE support on <code>wchar</code>.<p>

    <li>The program entry point function, in any form mentioned above, must
        always be declared with arguments, <em>e.g.</em>,
        <pre>
        int
        ACE_TMAIN (int argc, ACE_TCHAR *argv[])
        {
          [...]

          return 0;
        }
        </pre><p>

        If you don't use the <code>argc</code> and/or <code>argv</code>
        arguments, don't declare them, <em>e.g.</em>,
        <pre>
        int
        ACE_TMAIN (int, ACE_TCHAR *[])
        {
          [...]

          return 0;
        }
        </pre><p>

        Please declare the second argument as <code>ACE_TCHAR *[]</code>
        instead of <code>ACE_TCHAR **</code> or <code>char *[]</CODE>.
        Ancient versions of MSC++
        complained about <code>ACE_TCHAR **</code> and <code>char
        *[]</CODE> is not Unicode-compliant.<p>

        <code>main</code> must also return 0 on successful
        termination, and non-zero otherwise.<p>

    <li>Avoid use of floating point types (<code>float</code> and
            <code>double</code>) and operations
        unless absolutely necessary.  Not all ACE platforms support them.
        Therefore, wherever they are used, <code>ACE_LACKS_FLOATING_POINT</code>
        conditional code must be also be used.<p>

    <li>Avoid including the string "<code>Error</code>" in a source
            code filename. GNU Make's error messages start with
            "<code>Error</code>".  So, it's much easier to search for
            errors if filenames don't contain "<code>Error</code>".<p>


    <li>Narrow interfaces are better than wide interfaces.  If there
        isn't a need for an interface, leave it out.  This eases maintenance,
        minimizes footprint, and reduces the likelihood of interference
        when other interfaces need to be added later.  (See the
        <a href="#ACE_Time_Value example">ACE_Time_Value</a> example
        .<p>

     <li> Never use <CODE>assert()</CODE> macros or related constructs
         (such as abort()) calls in core ACE, TAO, and CIAO
         library/framework code.  These macros are a major problem for
         production software that uses this code since the
         error-handling strategy (i.e., abort the process) is
         excessive.  Instead, extract out the expressions from
         assert() macros and use them as
         precondition/postconditions/invariants in the
         software and return any violations of these
         conditions/invariants via exceptions or error return values.
         It's fine to use <CODE>assert()</CODE> macros et al. in test
         programs, but make sure these tests never find their way into
         the core ACE, TAO, and CIAO library/framework code base. <P>

  </ul>

  <li><strong>Code Documentation</strong><p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use comments and whitespace (:-) liberally.  Comments
        should consist of complete sentences, <em>i.e.</em>, start
        with a capital letter and end with a period.<p>

    <li>Insert a svn keyword string at the top of every source file,
        Makefile, config file, <em>etc</em>.  For C++ files, it is:
        <pre>
        // $<!-- -->Id$
        </pre>
        It is not necessary to fill in the fields of the keyword string,
        or modify them when you edit a file that already has one. SVN
        does that automatically when you checkout or update the file.<p>

        To insert that string at the top of a file:
        <pre>
        perl -pi -e \
          'if (! $o) {printf "// \$<!-- -->Id\$\n\n";}; $o = 1;' <em>file</em>
        </pre><p>

    <li>Be sure to follow the guidelines and restrictions for use of the
        documentation tools for ACE
        header files, which must follow the
        <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>
        format requirements.
        The complete documentation for Doxygen is available in the
        <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestman">
        Doxygen manual</a>.
        For an example header file using Doxygen-style comments,
        please refer to <a href="../ace/ACE.h">ACE.h</a>.<p>

    <LI>All binary options for ACE and TAO should be specified in
        terms of the integral values 0 and 1, rather than "true" and
        "false" or "yes" and "no".  All TAO options should be
        documented in the <A HREF="../TAO/docs/Options.html">online
        TAO options document</A>. <P>.

  </ul>

  <li><strong>Preprocessor</strong><p>
  <ul>
    <li>Never #include standard headers directly, except in a few
        specific ACE files, <em>e.g.</em>, OS.h and stdcpp.h.  Let
        those files #include the correct headers.  If you do not do
        this, your code will not compile with the Standard C++ Library.<p>

    <li>Always use <strong><code>#if defined (MACRONAME)</code></strong>
        to test if a macro is defined, rather than the simpler
        <strong><code>#if MACRONAME</code></strong>. Doxygen requires this.
        The one exception to this the macros used to prevent multiple
        inclusion of header files, as shown below.

    <li>Always follow a preprocessor <strong><code>#endif</code></strong>
        with a <strong><code>/*  */</code></strong> C-style comment. Using
        C-style comments with preprocessor code is required for some old
        compilers. It should correspond to the condition in the matching
        <strong><code>#if</code></strong> directive.  For example,
        <pre>
        #if defined (ACE_HAS_THREADS)
        # if defined (ACE_HAS_STHREADS)
        #   include /**/ &lt;synch.h&gt;
        #   include /**/ &lt;thread.h&gt;
        #   define ACE_SCOPE_PROCESS P_PID
        #   define ACE_SCOPE_LWP P_LWPID
        #   define ACE_SCOPE_THREAD (ACE_SCOPE_LWP + 1)
        # else
        #   define ACE_SCOPE_PROCESS 0
        #   define ACE_SCOPE_LWP 1
        #   define ACE_SCOPE_THREAD 2
        # endif /* ACE_HAS_STHREADS */
        #endif /* ACE_HAS_THREADS */
        </pre><p>

    <li>Be sure to put spaces around comment delimiters, e.g.,
        <strong><code>char * /* foo */</code></strong> instead of
        <strong><code>char */*foo*/</code></strong>.  MS VC++
        complains otherwise.<p>

    <li>Always insert a <strong><code>/**/</code></strong> between an
        <strong><code>#include</code></strong> and
        <strong><code>filename</code></strong>, for system headers and
        <strong><code>ace/pre.h</code></strong> and
        <strong><code>ace/post.h</code></strong> as
        shown in the above example.  This avoids dependency problems
        with Visual C++ and prevents Doxygen from including the
        headers in the file reference trees.  <p>

    <li>Be very careful with names of macros, <code>enum</code> values, and variables
        It's always best to prefix them with something like <code>ACE_</code>
        or <code>TAO_</code>.  There are too many system headers out
        there that <code>#define</code> <code>OK</code>, <code>SUCCESS</code>,
        <code>ERROR</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>s_type</code>,
        and so on.<p>

    <li>When using macros in an arithmetic expression, be sure to test
      that the macro is defined, using <code>defined(<em>macro</em>)</code> before specifying
      the expression.  For example:
<pre>
#if __FreeBSD__ &lt; 3
</pre>

will evaluate true on any platform where <code>__FreeBSD__</code> is
not defined.  The correct way to write that guard is:
<pre>
#if defined (__FreeBSD__)  &&  __FreeBSD__ &lt; 3
</pre>

If using g++, problems like this can be flagged as a warning by using the "<code>-Wundef</code>" command line option.

    <li>Try to centralize <code>#ifdef</code>s with <code>typedef</code>s
        and <code>#define</code>s.  For example, use this:
        <pre>
        #if defined(ACE_PSOS)
          typedef long ACE_NETIF_TYPE;
        # define ACE_DEFAULT_NETIF 0
        #else  /* ! ACE_PSOS */
          typedef const TCHAR* ACE_NETIF_TYPE;
        # define ACE_DEFAULT_NETIF ASYS_TEXT("le0")
        #endif /* ! ACE_PSOS */
        </pre><p>

        instead of:

        <pre><p>
        #if defined (ACE_PSOS)
          // pSOS supports numbers, not names for network interfaces
          long net_if,
        #else  /* ! ACE_PSOS */
          const TCHAR *net_if,
        #endif /* ! ACE_PSOS */
        </pre><p>

    <li>Protect header files against multiple inclusion with this
        construct:
        <pre>
        #ifndef FOO_H
        #define FOO_H

        [contents of header file]

        #endif /* FOO_H */
        </pre><p>

        This exact construct (note the <code>#ifndef</code>)
        is optimized by many compilers such they only open the
        file once per compilation unit.  Thanks to Eric C. Newton
        &lt;ecn@smart.net&gt; for pointing that out.<p>

        If the header <code>#include</code>s an ACE library header,
        then it's a good idea to include the <code>#pragma once</code>
        directive:
        <pre>
        #ifndef FOO_H
        #define FOO_H

        #include "ace/ACE.h"
        #if !defined (ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE)
        # pragma once
        #endif /* ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE */

        [contents of header file]

        #endif /* FOO_H */
        </pre><p>

        <code>#pragma once</code> must be protected, because some
        compilers complain about it.  The protection depends on
        <code>ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE</code>, which is defined in
        some ACE config headers.  Therefore, the protected
        <code>#pragma once</code> construct should only be used after
        an <code>#include</code> of an ACE library header.  Note that
        many compilers enable the optimization if the <code>#ifndef</code>
        protection construct is used, so for them, <code>#pragma once</code>
        is superfluous.<p>

        <strong>No</strong> code can appear after the final
        <code>#endif</code> for the optimization to be effective and
        correct.<p>

    <li><p>Files that contain parametric classes should follow this style:
      <pre>
      #ifndef FOO_T_H
      #define FOO_T_H

      #include "ace/ACE.h"
      #if !defined (ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE)
      # pragma once
      #endif /* ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE */

      // Put your template declarations here...

      #if defined (__ACE_INLINE__)
      #include "Foo_T.inl"
      #endif /* __ACE_INLINE__ */

      #if defined (ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE)
      #include "Foo_T.cpp"
      #endif /* ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE */

      #if defined (ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_PRAGMA)
      #pragma implementation "Foo_T.cpp"
      #endif /* ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_PRAGMA */

      #endif /* FOO_T_H */
</pre></p>
      <p>
      Notice that some compilers need to see the code of the template,
      hence the <code>.cpp</code> file must be included from the
      header file.
      </p>
      <p>
      To avoid multiple inclusions of the <code>.cpp</code> file it
      should also be protected as in:
      <pre>
      #ifndef FOO_T_CPP
      #define FOO_T_CPP

      #include "Foo_T.h"
      #if !defined (ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE)
      # pragma once
      #endif /* ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE */

      #if !defined (__ACE_INLINE__)
      #include "ace/Foo_T.inl"
      #endif /* __ACE_INLINE__ */

      // put your template code here

      #endif /* FOO_T_H */
</pre></p>
      <p>Finally, you may want to include the template header file from a
      non-template header file (check
      <code>$ACE_ROOT/ace/Synch.h</code>); in such a case the template
      header should be included <strong>after</strong> the inline
      function definitions, as in:</p>
      <p><pre>
      #ifndef FOO_H
      #define FOO_H

      #include "ace/ACE.h"
      #if !defined (ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE)
      # pragma once
      #endif /* ACE_LACKS_PRAGMA_ONCE */

      // Put your non-template declarations here...

      #if defined (__ACE_INLINE__)
      #include "Foo.inl"
      #endif /* __ACE_INLINE__ */

      #include "Foo_T.h"

      #endif /* FOO_H */
</pre></p></li>

    <li>Avoid <code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;</code> if at all possible.
      The <code>/usr/include/math.h</code> on SunOS 5.5.1 through 5.7
      defines a struct name <strong>exception</strong>, which complicates
      use of exceptions.<p>

    <li>On a <code>.cpp</code> file always include the corresponding
      header file <em>first</em>, like this:<p>
<pre>
        // This is Foo.cpp

        #include "Foo.h"
        #include "tao/Bar.h"
        #include "ace/Baz.h"

        // Here comes the Foo.cpp code....
</pre><p>

      In this way we are sure that the header file is self-contained
      and can be safely included from some place else.

    <li>In the TAO library <strong>never</strong> include
      <code>&lt;corba.h&gt</code>, this file should only be included
      by the user and introduces cyclic dependencies in the library
      that we must avoid.<p>

    <li>Never include a header file when a forward reference will do,
      remember that templates can be forward referenced too.
      Consult your favorite C++ book to find out when you must include
      the full class definition.<p>
  </ul>

  <li><strong>C++ Syntax and Constructs</strong><p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><code>for</code></strong> loops should look like:
        <pre>
        for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i)
          ++total;
        </pre>
        Though, I prefer to always wrap the body of the loop in braces,
        to avoid surprises when other code or debugging statements are
        added, and to maintain sanity when the body consists of a macro,
        such as an <code>ACE_ASSERT</code> without a trailing semicolon:
        <pre>
        for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i)
          {
            ACE_ASSERT (++total &lt; UINT_MAX;)
          }
        </pre><p>

        Similarly, <strong><code>if</code></strong> statements should have
        a space after the "<strong>if</strong>", and no spaces just after
        the opening parenthesis and just before the closing parenthesis.<p>

    <li>If a loop index is used after the body of the loop, it
        <strong>must</strong> be declared before the loop.  For example,

        <pre>
        size_t i = 0;
        for (size_t j = 0; file_name [j] != '\0'; ++i, ++j)
          {
            if (file_name [j] == '\\' && file_name [j + 1] == '\\')
              ++j;

            file_name [i] = file_name [j];
          }

        // Terminate this string.
        file_name [i] = '\0';
        </pre><p>

   <li>Prefix operators are generally more efficient than postfix
       operators.  Therefore, they are preferred over their postfix
       counterparts where the expression value is not used.<p>

       Therefore, use this idiom for iterators, with prefix operator
       on the loop index:
       <pre>
       ACE_Ordered_MultiSet&lt;int&gt; set;
       ACE_Ordered_MultiSet_Iterator&lt;int&gt; iter(set);

       for (i = -10; i &lt; 10; ++i)
         set.insert (2 * i + 1);

       </pre>
       rather than the postfix operator:
       <pre>
       for (i = -10; i &lt; 10; i++)
         set.insert (2 * i + 1);
       </pre><p>

    <li>Prefer using <strong> <code> if (...) else .... </code> </strong>
    instead of <strong> <code> ?: </code> </strong> operator. It is a lot
    less error prone, and will help you avoid bugs caused due to the
    precedence of <strong> <code> ?: </code> </strong>, compared with other
    operators in an expression.

    <li>When a class provides <code>operator==</code>, it must also provide
        <code>operator!=</code>.  Also, both these operators must be
        <code>const</code> and return <code>bool</code>.

    <li>Avoid unnecessary parenthesis.  We're not writing Lisp :-)<p>

    <li>Put inline member functions in a <strong><code>.inl</code></strong>
        file.  That file is conditionally included by both the
        <strong><code>.h</code></strong> file, for example:<p>

            <pre>
            class ACE_Export ACE_High_Res_Timer
            {
              [...]
            };

            #if defined (__ACE_INLINE__)
            #include "ace/High_Res_Timer.inl"
            #endif /* __ACE_INLINE__ */
            </pre><p>

        and <strong><code>.cpp</code></strong> file:<p>

            <pre>
            #define ACE_BUILD_DLL
            #include "ace/High_Res_Timer.h"

            #if !defined (__ACE_INLINE__)
            #include "ace/High_Res_Timer.inl"
            #endif /* __ACE_INLINE__ */

            ACE_ALLOC_HOOK_DEFINE(ACE_High_Res_Timer)
            </pre><p>

        <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is very important to ensure than an
        inline function will not be used before its definition is seen.
        Therefore, the inline functions in the .inl file should be arranged
        properly.  Some compilers, such as <code>g++</code> with the
        <code>-Wall</code> option, will issue warnings for violations.<p>

    <li>Some inlining heuristics:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>One liners should almost always be inline, as in:
<pre>
ACE_INLINE

        <li>The notable exception is virtual functions, which should
            generally not be inlined.<p>

        <li>Big (more than 10 lines) and complex function (more than one if ()
          statement, or a switch, or a loop) should not be inlined.<p>

        <li>Medium sized stuff depends on how performance critical it is.
          If you know that it's in the critical path, then make it
                inline.  When in doubt, profile the code.<p>
      </ul>

    <li><code>ACE_Export</code> must be inserted between the
        <code>class</code> keyword and class name for all classes that
        are exported from libraries, as shown in the example above.
        <strong>However</strong>, do <strong>not</strong> use
        <code>ACE_Export</code> for template classes or classes that
        are not used out of the ACE library, for example.!<p>

    <li>Mutators and accessors should be of this form:<p>

        <pre>
        /// Sets @c object_addr_ cache from @c host and @c port.
        void object_addr (const ACE_INET_Addr &);

        /// Returns the ACE_INET_Addr for this profile.
        const ACE_INET_Addr &object_addr const (void);
        </pre><p>

        instead of the "set_" and "get_" form.<p>

    <li>Never use <strong><code>delete</code></strong> to deallocate
        memory that was allocated with <strong><code>malloc</code></strong>.
        Similarly, never associate <strong><code>free</code></strong> with
        <strong><code>new</code></strong>.
        <strong><code>ACE_NEW</code></strong> or
        <strong><code>ACE_NEW_RETURN</code></strong> should be used to
        allocate memory, and <strong><code>delete</code></strong> should
        be used to deallocate it.  And be careful to use the correct form,
        <strong><code>delete</code></strong> or
        <strong><code>delete []</code></strong> to correspond to the
        allocation.<p>

    <li>Don't check for a pointer being 0 before deleting it.  It's
        always safe to delete a 0 pointer.  If the pointer is visible
        outside the local scope, it's often a good idea to 0 it
        _after_ deleting it.  Note, the same argument applies to
        free().<p>

    <li>Always use <strong><code>ACE_NEW</code></strong> or
        <strong><code>ACE_NEW_RETURN</code></strong> to allocate memory,
        because they check for successful allocation and set errno
        appropriately if it fails.<p>

    <li>Never compare or assign a pointer value with <strong>NULL</strong>;
        use <strong>0</strong> instead.  The language allows any pointer to
        be compared or assigned with <strong>0</strong>.  The definition
        of <strong>NULL</strong> is implementation dependent, so it is
        difficult to use portably without casting.<p>

    <li>Never cast a pointer to or from an <strong><code>int</code></strong>
        or a <strong><code>long</code></strong>.  On all currently supported
        ACE platforms, it is safe to cast a pointer to or from
        <strong><code>intptr_t</code></strong> or
        <strong><code>uintptr_t</code></strong> (include ace/Basic_Types.h).<p>

    <li>Be very careful when selecting an integer type that must be a
        certain size, <em>e.g.</em>, 4 bytes.  <strong>long</strong> is
        not 4 bytes on all platforms; it is 8 bytes on many 64-bit
        machines.  ACE_UINT32 is always 4 bytes, and ACE_UINT64 is
        always 8 bytes.<p>

    <li>If a class has any virtual functions, and its destructor is
        declared explicitly in the class, then the destructor should
        <strong>always</strong> be virtual as well.  And to support
        compiler activities such as generation of virtual tables and,
        in some cases, template instantiation, the virtual destructor
        should <strong>not be inline</strong>.  (Actually, any non-pure
        virtual function could be made non-inline for this purpose.  But,
        for convenience, if its performance is not critical, it is usually
        easiest just to make the virtual destructor non-inline.)<p>


    <li><a name="ACE_Time_Value example">Avoid default arguments</a>
        unless there's a good reason.  For an example of how they got
        us into a jam is:
        <pre>
        ACE_Time_Value (long sec, long usec = 0);
        </pre>

        So, <code>ACE_Time_Value (2.5)</code> has the unfortunate
        effect of coercing the 2.5 to a long with value 2.  That's
        probably not what the programmer intended, and many compilers
        don't warn about it.<p>

        A nice fix would be to add an <code>ACE_Time_Value (double)</code>
        constructor.  But, that would cause ambiguous overloading
        due to the default value for the second argument of
        <code>ACE_Time_Value (long sec, long usec = 0)</code>.
        We're stuck with <code>ACE_Time_Value</code>, but now we
        know that it's easy to avoid.<p>

    <li>Constructor initializers must appear in the same order as
        the data members are declared in the class header.  This avoids
        subtle errors, because initialization takes place in the order
        of member declaration.<p>

    <li>Initialization is usually cleaner than assignment, especially
        in a conditional.  So, instead of writing code like this:

        <pre>
        ssize_t n_bytes;

        // Send multicast of one byte, enough to wake up server.
        if ((n_bytes = multicast.send ((char *) &reply_port,
          sizeof reply_port)) == -1)
        </pre>

        Write it like this:

        <pre>
        ssize_t n_bytes = multicast.send ((char *) &reply_port,
          sizeof reply_port)

        // Send multicast of one byte, enough to wake up server.
        if (n_bytes == -1)
        </pre><p>

        But, beware if the initialization is of a static variable.
        A static variable is only initialized the first time its
        declaration is seen.  Of course, we should avoid using
        static (and non-constant) variables at all.<p>

    <li>It is usually clearer to write conditionals that have
        both branches without a negated condition.  For example,<p>

        <pre>
        if (test)
          {
            // true branch
          }
        else
          {
            // false branch
          }
        </pre><p>

        is preferred over:<p>

        <pre>
        if (! test)
          {
            // false test branch
          }
        else
          {
            // true test branch
          }
        </pre><p>

    <li>If a cast is necessary, avoid use of C-style "sledgehammer"
            casts.  Use standard C++ casts
            (e.g. <code>static_cast&lt;int&gt; (foo)</code>) instead.<p>

    <li>In general, if instances of a class should not be copied,
        then a private copy constructor and assignment operator should
        be declared for the class, but not implemented.  For example:

        <pre>
        // Disallow copying by not implementing the following . . .
        ACE_Object_Manager (const ACE_Object_Manager &);
        ACE_Object_Manager &operator= (const ACE_Object_Manager &);
        </pre><p>

        If the class is a template class, then the
        <code>ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC</code> macro should be used:

        <pre>
        // = Disallow copying...
        ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC (ACE_TSS (const ACE_TSS&lt;TYPE&gt; &))
        ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC (void operator= (const ACE_TSS&lt;TYPE&gt; &))
        </pre><p>

        <code>ACE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FUNC</code> can be used with non-template
        classes as well.  Though for consistency and maximum safety, it
        should be avoided for non-template classes.<p>

    <li>Never use <code>BOOL</code>, or similar types.
            (<code>ACE_CDR::Boolean</code> and
            <code>CORBA::Boolean</code> are acceptable).  Use the
            standard C++ <code>bool</code> for boolean variables, instead.<p>

    <li>Functions should always return -1 to indicate failure, and
        0 or greater to indicate success.<p>

    <li>Separate the code of your templates from the code for
        non-parametric classes: some compilers get confused when
        template and non-template code is mixed in the same file.<p>

    <li>It's a good idea to specify the include path (with <code>-I</code>)
        to include any directory which contains files with template
        definitions.  The Compaq Tru64 cxx <code>-ptv</code> compiler option
        may help diagnose missing template instantiation problems.<p>

    <li>When referring to member variables and functions, use
        <code>this-&gt;</code><em>member</em>. This makes it clear to the
        reader that a class member is being used. It also makes it crystal
        clear to the compiler which variable/function you mean in cases
        where it might make a difference. <p>

    <li>Don't use template template arguments, this C++ construct is not
        supported by the HP aCC 3.70 compiler at this moment. For example the
	following template decleration is one that just doesn't work.
        <pre>
        template&lt;typename S_var, size_t BOUND, template &lt;typename&gt; class Insert_Policy&gt; class A {};
        </pre>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>I/O</strong><p>
  <ul>
     <li>Use <strong><code>ACE_DEBUG</code></strong> for printouts,
         and <strong><code>ACE_OS::fprintf ()</code></strong> for
         file I/O.  Avoid using iostreams because of implementation
         differences across platforms.<p>
     <li>After attempting to open an existing file, always check for success.
         Take appropriate action if the open failed.<p>
     <li>Notice that <strong><code>ACE_DEBUG</code></strong> and
         <strong><code>ACE_ERROR</code></strong> don't support
         <code>%ld</code> of any other multicharacter format.<p>
  </ul>

  <li><strong>WCHAR conformity</strong><p>

  <ul>
     <li>For ACE, use <code>ACE_TCHAR</code> instead of char for strings and <code>ACE_TEXT()</code>
         around string literals.  Exceptions are <code>char</code>
            arrays used for data  and strings that need to remain as 1
            byte characters.

     <li>If you have a char string that needs to be converted to <code>ACE_TCHAR</code>,
         use the <code>ACE_TEXT_CHAR_TO_TCHAR()</code> macro.  If you have a <code>ACE_TCHAR</code>
         string that needs to be converted to a <code>char</code> string, use the
         <code>ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR()</code> macro

     <li>Do not use the Win32 <code>TCHAR</code> macros.  The wide character-ness of ACE
         is separate from UNICODE and _UNICODE.

     <li>For TAO, don't use <code>ACE_TCHAR</code> or <code>ACE_TEXT</code>.  The CORBA specification
         defines APIs as using char.  So most of the time there is no need
         to use wide characters.
  </ul><P>

  <li><strong>Exceptions</strong><p>

  <ul>
    <li>There are many ways of throwing and catching exceptions. The
        code below gives several examples.  Note that each method has
        different semantics and costs. Whenever possible, use the
        first approach.<p>

        <pre>
        #include "iostream.h"

        class exe_foo
        {
        public:
          exe_foo (int data) : data_ (data)
            { cerr &lt;&lt; "constructor of exception called" &lt;&lt; endl; }
          ~exe_foo ()
            { cerr &lt;&lt; "destructor of exception called" &lt;&lt; endl; }
          exe_foo (const exe_foo& foo) : data_ (foo.data_)
            { cerr &lt;&lt; "copy constructor of exception called"
                   &lt;&lt; endl; }
          int data_;
        };


        void

        };

        void
        bad (int a)

            }
          catch (exe_foo &foo)
            {
              cerr &lt;&lt; "exception caught: " &lt;&lt; foo.data_
                   &lt;&lt; endl;
            }

          cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Second exception" &lt;&lt; endl
               &lt;&lt; endl;
          try
            {
              good (0);
            }
          catch (exe_foo foo)
            {
              cerr &lt;&lt; "exception caught: " &lt;&lt; foo.data_
                   &lt;&lt; endl;
            }

          cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Third exception" &lt;&lt; endl
               &lt;&lt; endl;
          try
            {
              bad (1);
            }
          catch (exe_foo &foo)
            {
              cerr &lt;&lt; "exception caught: " &lt;&lt; foo.data_
                   &lt;&lt; endl;
            }

          cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Fourth exception" &lt;&lt; endl
               &lt;&lt; endl;
          try
            {
              bad (1);
            }
          catch (exe_foo foo)
            {
              cerr &lt;&lt; "exception caught: " &lt;&lt; foo.data_
                   &lt;&lt; endl;
            }

          return 0;
        }

<h3><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-overview.html">ACE</a>
  Shared Libary Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create a separate export macro for each dynamic library.  A
          header file containing the export macro and additional
          support macros should be generated by using the <a
            href="../bin/generate_export_file.pl">ACE_wrappers/bin/generate_export_file.pl</a> Perl script.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure that your classes, structures and free functions
          are annotated with this export macro.  The only exceptions
          are pure template classes, structures and free functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only classes (and structures, free functions, etc) that are
          part of the library public interface must be exported
          (e.g. declared with an export macro).  Those that are only
          meant to be used internally need not be exported,
          particularly for g++ <code>&gt;=</code>4.0  since doing so
          defeats some neat optimizations.  Here's a common case in
          where an export macro is generally used unnecessarily:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
class FooExport Foo
{
public:
  virtual void kung_fu () = 0;
};

class FooExport Bar : public Foo
{
public:
  virtual void kung_fu ()  { ... }
};

class FooExport FooFactory
{
public:
  Foo * make_foo ()
    {
      // Assume that this implementation is hidden from
      // the application and is consequently out of line.
      return new Bar();
    }
};
          </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Here the application is only meant to invoke operations
          through a pointer or reference to the abstract base class
          "<code>Foo</code>" created by the "<code>FooFactory</code>",
          not the "<code>Bar</code>" subclass.  In this case,
          exporting "<code>Bar</code>" is unnecessary.  If your
          concrete class is meant to be used outside of the shared
          library (e.g. as a template parameter, within a
          <code>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;</code>, etc) you must then export
          it.  Otherwise, avoid doing so if you can.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure that you specify that you are creating a dynamic
          library in your <a href="../MPC/README">MPC</a> file by adding
          a <code>sharedname</code> tag.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure that you add the <code>FOO_BUILD_DLL</code>
          preprocessor symbol to the <code>dynamicflags</code> of the
          MPC project that is used to build a library.  Note that the
          export files are setup such that when this macro is defined,
          the symbols are exported, otherwise they are imported.  The
          default behaviour is to set up for import so that clients of
          your library don't need to worry about arcane build flags
          like <code>FOO_BUILD_DLL</code> in their build setup.  This
          ties back to the first item.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When you specify the order of libraries to link to, make
          sure that the dependent libraries come after the libraries
          which depend on them, i.e., your link line should always
          contain <code>-lDependsOnFoo -lFoo</code>.  Note that this
          is not a requirement on GNU/Linux but linkers on other
          platforms are not as forgiving.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the <code>ACE_SINGLETON_DECLARE</code> macro to declare
          a class as a singleton.  Declare exported (i.e. default
          visibility)  singleton templates prior to typedefs that
          reference them.  This prevents g++ 4.0 from silently making
          their visibility hidden (see <a
            href="http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2260">Bug 2260</a> for details).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid inlining virtual functions in classes that must be
          exported since doing so can cause RTTI related problems
          (e.g. <code>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt; failures</code>) when using
          g++ &gt;= 4.0 due to our use of that compiler's "visibility
          attribute" support that is tied in to the export macros.
          This includes virtual destructors automatically created by
          the compiler when you don't declare one.  Make sure you
          define a no-op out-of-line virtual destructor if your base
          class has a virtual destructor since you may otherwise run
          into the mentioned RTTI problems.

<h3><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-overview.html">ACE</a>
  Usage Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always use the <strong><code>ACE_OS</code></strong>
      namespace functions instead of bare OS system calls.<p>

  <li>As a general rule, the only functions that should go into the
      <strong><code>ACE_OS</code></strong> namespace are ones that
        have direct equivalents on some OS platform.  Functions that
        are extensions should go in the
        <strong><code>ACE</code></strong> namespace.<p>

  <li>Use the <strong><code>ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX</code></strong> macro,
      instead of using one of the specific mutexes, such as
      <strong><code>ACE_Thread_Mutex</code></strong>.  This provides
      portability between threaded and non-threaded platforms.<p>

  <li>Avoid creating a static instance of user-defined (class) type.
      Instead, either create it as an
      <strong><code>ACE_Singleton</code></strong>,
      <strong><code>ACE_TSS_Singleton</code></strong>, or as an
      <strong><code>ACE_Cleanup</code></strong> object.  See the
      <strong>ACE</strong>
      <a href="../ace/Singleton.h"><code>Singleton.h</code></a>,
      <a href="../ace/Object_Manager.h"><code>Object_Manager.h</code></a>, and
      <a href="../ace/Managed_Object.h"><code>Managed_Object.h</code></a>
      header files for more information.<p>

      Static instances of built-in types, such as
      <strong><code>int</code></strong> or any pointer type, are fine.<p>

      Construction of static instance of a user-defined type should
      <em>never</em> spawn threads.  Because order of construction of
      statics across files is not defined by the language, it is usually
      assumed that only one thread exists during static construction.
      This allows statics suchs as locks to be safely created.  We do not
      want to violate this assumption.<p>

  <li>Do not use C++ exception handling directly.  Some platforms do
      not support it.  And, it can impose an execution speed penalty.
      Instead use the TAO/ACE try/catch macros.<p>

  <li>Because ACE does not use exception handling, dealing with
      failures requires a bit of care.  This is especially true
      in constructors.  Consider the following approach:

      <pre>
      ACE_NEW_RETURN (this-&gt;name_space_, LOCAL_NAME_SPACE, -1);

      if (ACE_LOG_MSG-&gt;op_status () != 0)
      ....
      </pre>

      This snip of code is from
      <a href="../ace/Naming_Context.cpp"><code>ACE_Naming_Context</code></a>.
      All failed constructors in ACE (should) call ACE_ERROR.  This sets
      the thread-specific <strong>op_status</strong>, which can be checked
      by the caller.  This mechanism allows the caller to check for a failed
      constructor without the requiring the constructor to throw
      exceptions.<p>

  <LI>Another consequence of ACE's avoidance of exception handling is
      that you should use <CODE>open()</CODE> methods on classes that
      perform initializations that can fail.  This is because <CODE>open()</CODE>
      returns an error code that's easily checked by the caller,
      rather than relying on constructor and thread-specific status
      values. <P>

  <li>Avoid using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in our
      applications.  Some platforms do not support it yet. It is
      safe to use the STL generic algoritms. The following have been
      used already and don't seem to cause any portability issues:
      <pre>
	std::swap
	std::for_each
	std::fill
	std::generate
	std::transform
	std::copy
      </pre><p>

  <li>Be <em>very</em> careful with <code>ACE_ASSERT</code>.  It
      must only be used to check values; it may never be used to
      wrap a function call, or contain any other side effect.  That's
      because the statement will disappear when ACE_NDEBUG is enabled.
      For example, this code is BAD:
      <pre>
      ACE_ASSERT (this-&gt;next (retv) != 0);  // BAD CODE!
      </pre>

      Instead, the above should be coded this way:

      <pre>
      int const result = this-&gt;next (retv);
      ACE_ASSERT (result != 0);
      ACE_UNUSED_ARG (result);
      </pre><p>

  <li>Never put side effects in <code>ACE_DEBUG</code> code:
      <pre>
      ACE_DEBUG ((LM_DEBUG,
                 "handling signal: %d iterations left\n",
                 --this-&gt;iterations_));        // BAD CODE!
      </pre>

      Note that this won't work correctly if <code>ACE_NDEBUG</code> is
      defined, for the same reason that having side-effects in
      <code>ACE_ASSERT</code>s won't work either, <em>i.e.</em>, because
      the code is removed.<p>

  <li>Be <strong>very</strong> careful with the code that you put
      in a signal handler.  On Solaris, the man pages document systems
      calls as being Async-Signal-Safe if they can be called from signal
      handlers.  In general, it's best to just set a flag in a signal
      handler and take appropriate action elsewhere.  It's also best
      to avoid using signals, especially asynchronous signals.<p>

  <li>Immediately after opening a temporary file, unlink it.  For
      example:
      <pre><code>
      ACE_HANDLE h = open the file (filename);

      ACE_OS::unlink (filename);
      </code></pre><p>

      This avoids leaving the temporary file even if the program crashes.<p>

  <li>Be sure to specify the <code>THR_BOUND</code> thread creation
    flag for time-critical threads.  This ensures that the thread competes
    for resources globally on Solaris.  It is harmless on other platforms.<p>
</ul>

<h3><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-overview.html">Other
  ACE</a> and
  <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-overview.html">TAO</a>
  Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When enhancing, updating, or fixing ACE or TAO, always:
  <ol>
    <li>Test your change on at least Windows and Linux before commiting.
      After commiting watch the scoreboard to catch errors your change
      may be related to on other platforms.
    <li>An an entry to the appropriate ChangeLog.  TAO and some
      ACE subdirectories, such as <a href="../ASNMP">ASNMP</a>,
      <a href="../apps/JAWS">JAWS</a>, and
      <a href="../apps/gperf">gperf,</a> have their
      own ChangeLogs.  If you don't use one of those, use the
      <a href="../ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> in the top-level
      <a href="..">ACE_wrappers</a> directory. A ChangeLog entry should
      have the form:
      <pre>&lt;tab&gt; * dir/file.ext [(methods)]: description...</pre>
      If you have a number of files, the names should be on separate lines.
      In this case, it's also ok to start the description on a new line
      indented to "dir."
    <li>Commit your change using a message of this form:<p>
<code>
ChangeLogTag: Thu Jul 22 09:55:10 UTC 1999  David L. Levine
 &lt;levine@cs.wustl.edu&gt;
</code>
    <li>If the change is in response to a request by someone else:
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure that person is acknowledged in
        <a href="../THANKS">ACE_wrappers/THANKS</a>, and<p>
      <li>Respond to that person.<p>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li><strong>Never</strong> add copyrighted, confidential, or otherwise
      restricted code to the ACE or TAO distributions without reviewing
      the situation with DOC management (i.e. Doug Schmidt). You will also
      most likely need to get written permission from the owner. The
      particular language and form needed will be relayed to you after
      discussing it with DOC management.<p>
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>SVN Usage Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always make sure that a change builds and executes correctly
    on at least one platform before checking it into the SVN repository.
    All changes <strong>must</strong> be tested with g++ before commiting.
    That means you may need to test on at least two platforms.<p>
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>Script Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In general, it's best to write scripts in Perl.  It's
    OK to use Bourne shell.  Never, never, never use csh, ksh,
    bash, or any other kind of shell.<p>

  <li>Follow the Perl style guide guide as closely as
    possible.  <code>man perlstyle</code> to view it.

  <li>Don't specify a hard-coded path to Perl itself.  Use
    the following code at the top of the script to pick up
    perl from the users <code>PATH</code>:<br>
      <pre>
eval '(exit $?0)' && eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    & eval 'exec perl -S $0 $argv:q'
    if 0;
      </pre><p>

  <li>Never, never, never start the first line of a script
    with "<code>#</code>", unless the first line is "<code>#! /bin/sh</code>".
    With just "<code>#</code>", t/csh users will spawn a new shell.
    That will cause their <code>.[t]cshrc</code> to be
    processed, possibly clobbering a necessary part of
    their environment.<p>

  <li>If your Perl script relies on features only available
    in newer versions of Perl, include the a statement similar
    to the following:<br>
      <pre>
        require 5.003;
      </pre>

  <li>Don't depend on <strong><code>.</code></strong> being
    in the user's path.  If the script spawns another executable
    that is supposed to be in the current directory, be sure the
    prefix its filename with <strong><code>.</code></strong>.<p>
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>Software Engineering Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advise</strong>:  Keep other developers informed of problems
      and progress.<p>

  <li><strong>Authorize</strong>:  We have contractual obligations to not
      unilaterally change interfaces.  If you need to change or remove an
      interface, get an OK.<p>

  <li><strong>Minimize</strong> risk:  Test all changes.  Solicit review of
      changes.<p>

  <li><strong>Revise</strong> only when necessary:  Every change has risk,
      so avoid making any change unless there is a good reason for it.<p>

  <li><strong>Normalize</strong>:  Factor out commonality.  For example,
      maintain a data value in only one place.<p>

  <li><strong>Synthesize</strong>:  Build stubs and scaffolding early to
      simulate the complete system.  Maintain a checked-in version of the
      system that cleanly builds and tests at all times.<p>

  <li><strong>Be available</strong>:  Breaking compilation in one
      platform or another should be avoided (see above),
      but it is bound to happen when so many platforms are in use.
      Be available after making a change,
      if you won't be available for at least 48 hours after the change
      is made then don't make it!<p>
</ul>
