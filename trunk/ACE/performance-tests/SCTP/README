This directory provides programs that measure the round trip latency
of synchronous octet messaging using ACE wrapper-facades for the SCTP
protocol. Currently these programs provide the only example code on
how to use ACE's wrapper-facades for SCTP. In the future additional
code will be placed in the ACE_wrappers/examples/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP
directory.

SOCK_STREAM_clt and SOCK_STREAM_srv use the SOCK_STREAM service
provided by SCTP via ACE's SOCK_Connector, SOCK_Stream,
SOCK_Association wrapper-facade classes. 

SOCK_SEQPACK_clt and SOCK_SEQPACK_srv use the SOCK_SEQPACKET service
provided by SCTP via ACE's SOCK_SEQPACK_Connector,
SOCK_SEQPACK_Association and SOCK_SEQPACK_Acceptor wrapper-facade
classes.

The following table provides a summary of relationships between two main
Linux SCTP implementations (OpenSS7 and LKSCTP), and ACE Wrapper Facades
support that is provided. Built on top of the ACE Wrapper Facade support is
the SCIOP support in TAO. SCIOP works identically on both OpenSS7 and
LKSCTP implementations. Please read additional README* files listed below.
