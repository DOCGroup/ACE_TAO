		TTCP for c_version and ACE-wrappers
		----------------------------------------------------

This is the super-readme file for the "ttcp" code. This directory
contains the C and ACE-wrappers versions of ttcp code. To compile the
code, you have to do the following:

1. You should have ACE installed in your system and configured
   correctly. (see the reference manual for installation and
   configuration procedure) 

2. Copy this directory (ttcp) in the same directory structure to your
   disk space. 

3. setup the following environment parameters (before compilation stage):
   ACE_ROOT, LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For example:
ACE_ROOT=/project/adaptive/ACE_wrappers
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/project/adaptive/ACE_wrappers/build/SunOS5.4/ace

4. Do make (using GNU make) in this directory level. This will create
   the executable ttcp target code for each ttcp version.

5. Read the README or How_to_run_tests file existing in each directory
   to know how to use the  executable.

6. Have fun.
