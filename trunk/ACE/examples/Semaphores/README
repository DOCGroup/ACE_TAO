This is a small example how to use process semaphores. We use it to
synchronize between multiple processes and it was used to analyze
some differences between ACE 5.6 and 5.6.2.

To run do:
1. Start a init-app. It will create the semaphore a go to sleep.
2. Start a worker-app while the init-app still sleeps. This worker app will
block on the semaphore.
3. The init-app wakes up and releases the semahpre and exists.
4. The worker-app will now lock the semphore and go to sleep.
5. Start another worker-app while the first worker-app still sleeps. It will
block on the semaphore.
6. The first worker-app finally wakes up and releases the semaphore and
start doing its work.
