// Test the ability of the Reactor/Signal_Handler to register multiple
// handler per-signal.

/* This test works as follows:

	1. To test the "original" semantics of ACE (i.e., only one
	   ACE_Event_Handler can be registered per signal), you don't
	   need to do anything special.  Existing programs work the
	   same since giving the Reactor's constructor a 0 value
	   (which is the default argument, BTW) instructs it to behave
	   as before.  When a 0 is given, the ACE_Reactor's
	   constructor/open method creates an instance of
	   ACE_Sig_Handler and assigns this to an internal pointer.
	   This pointer is then used to dispatch all signal-related
	   methods within the Reactor.  The default ACE_Sig_Handler
	   only allows *one* ACE_Event_Handler to be registered
	   per-signal.

	   To run this version of the test do the following:

	   % ./test-signal
	   ./test_signals
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^C
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 0, 0) with count = 1
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^\
	   signal Quit occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 0, 0) with count = 2
	   shutting down SIGQUIT in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 0, 0)
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^C
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 0, 0) with count = 3
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^\Quit (core dumped)

           Note that in this test only one handler (the last one --
	   "Sig_Handler_2 (fruity)") is actually registered.  BTW, the
	   core dump is the expected behavior since the default
	   disposition is restored when there are no more handlers
	   (see the code below).

	2. To test the "multiple handlers per-signal semantics", you
	   need to pass the constructor/open method of the ACE_Reactor
	   a pointer to a an instance of ACE_Sig_Handlers (note the
	   plural "s").  ACE_Sig_Handlers is a class that derives from
	   ACE_Sig_Handler.  The difference between these two classes
	   is that (1) ACE_Sig_Handlers::register_signal allows
	   multiple ACE_Event_Handlers to be registered per-signal and
	   (2) it enables SA_RESTART by default.  This class also
	   implements Detlef Becker's algorithm for integrating ACE
	   signal handling with 3rd party libraries.

	   To run this version of the test do the following:

	   % ./test_signals 1

	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^C
	   signal Interrupt occurred in external handler!
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_1 (howdy, 3, 1) with count = 1
	   shutting down SIGINT in Sig_Handler_1 (howdy, 3, 1)
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_1 (doody, 5, 4) with count = 1
	   shutting down SIGINT in Sig_Handler_1 (doody, 5, 4)
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (tutty, 7, 6) with count = 1
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 9, 8) with count = 1
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^\
	   signal Quit occurred in Sig_Handler_1 (howdy, 3, 1) with count = 2
	   shutting down SIGQUIT in Sig_Handler_1 (howdy, 3, 1)
	   signal Quit occurred in Sig_Handler_1 (doody, 5, 4) with count = 2
	   shutting down SIGQUIT in Sig_Handler_1 (doody, 5, 4)
	   signal Quit occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (tutty, 7, 6) with count = 2
	   shutting down SIGQUIT in Sig_Handler_2 (tutty, 7, 6)
	   signal Quit occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 9, 8) with count = 2
	   shutting down SIGQUIT in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 9, 8)
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^C
	   signal Interrupt occurred in external handler!
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (tutty, 7, 6) with count = 3
	   signal Interrupt occurred in Sig_Handler_2 (fruity, 9, 8) with count = 3
	   waiting for SIGINT or SIGQUIT
	   ^\Quit (core dumped)

           When this test begins all four handlers are registered and
           dispatched when a SIGINT or SIGQUIT occurs.  After the
           first SIGINT, the handle_signal method of the Sig_Handler_1
           objects unregister themselves.  At that point there are 4
           SIGQUIT handlers left, but only 2 of our SIGINT handlers
           left (and the 1 external handler).  After the first
           SIGQUIT, there are no SIGQUIT handlers left since they all
           deregister themselves (which restores the "SIG_DFL"
           disposition).  On the second SIGINT there are only 3
           handlers left (2 of ours and 1 external).  Finally, on the
           second SIGQUIT we exit and dump core since that's what
           happens with the default disposition for SIGQUIT. */
