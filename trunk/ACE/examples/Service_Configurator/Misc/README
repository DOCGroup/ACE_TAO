This directory contains an example that illustrates how the ACE
Service Configurator can configure static and dynamic services, both
from the command-line and from a svc.config file.  We define several
instances, i.e., Timer_Service_1 and Timer_Service_2 of the SAME
service just to exercise different configuration options.  A "real"
application would usually define different services.

Windows CE:
-----------

When using Windows CE (WCE) emulator, make sure that you use the
following command to copy the svc.conf files into the top-level
directory in CE emulator.

  empfile -c svc.conf1 wce:\svc.conf1
  empfile -c svc.conf2 wce:\svc.conf2

The command "empfile" moves the files to emulator's root directory and
resigters the files with CE emulator's object store.

Also make sure you type in at least one argument (which is argv[0],)
when the program dialog box requests you to key in the program
arguments.  Otherwise, the program won't run at all.
