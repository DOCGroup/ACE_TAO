$Id$

This directory contains groups of client and server test programs that
exercise the various C++ wrappers for SSL sockets.  In general, the
test programs do more or less the same thing -- the client establishes
a connection with the server and then transfers data to the server,
which keeps printing the data until EOF is reached (e.g., user types
^D).

Unless noted differently, the server is implemented as an "iterative
server," i.e., it only deals with one client at a time.  The following
describes each set of tests in more detail:

  . SSL-{client,server}.cpp -- This test allows you to test
          oneway and twoway socket communication latency and
          throughput over SSL between two processes on the same
          machine or on different machines.
