THE ADAPTIVE COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT (ACE)

An Object-Oriented Network Programming Toolkit

Overview of ACE

The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is an object-oriented
toolkit that implements strategic and tactical design patterns to
simplify the development of concurrent, event-driven communication
software.  ACE provides a rich set of reusable C++ wrappers, class
categories, and frameworks that perform common communication software
tasks across a range of operating system platforms.  The communication
software tasks provided by ACE include event demultiplexing and event
handler dispatching, connection establishment, interprocess
communication, shared memory management, message routing, dynamic
(re)configuration of distributed services, multi-threading, and
concurrency control.

ACE is targeted for developers of high-performance concurrent network
applications and services.  The primary goal of ACE is to simplify the
development of concurrent OO communication software that utilizes
interprocess communication, event demultiplexing, explicit dynamic
linking, and concurrency.  In addition, ACE automates communication
software configuration and reconfiguration by dynamically linking
services into applications at run-time and executing these services on
one or more processes or threads.

ACE has been ported to a wide range of uni-processor and multi-process
OS platforms including Win32 (i.e., WinNT and Win95), most versions of
UNIX (e.g., SunOS 4.x and 5.x, SGI IRIX, HP-UX, OSF/1, AIX, Linux, and
SCO), VxWorks, and MVS OpenEdition.  It is currently used in
commercial products by dozens of companies including Ericsson,
Bellcore, Siemens, Motorola, and Kodak.

The remainder of this document outlines the structure and participants
of the layers in this diagram.

C++ Wrappers for OS Interfaces

The lower-level portions of ACE provide a set of portable and
type-secure C++ wrappers that encapsulate the following C language OS
interfaces:

        . IPC mechanisms 
                -- e.g., Internet- and UNIX-domain sockets, TLI, Named
		   Pipes (for UNIX and Win32) and STREAM pipes;

        . Event demultiplexing
                -- e.g., select(), poll(), and Win32
		   WaitForMultipleObjects and I/O completion ports;

        . Multi-threading and synchronization
                -- e.g., Solaris threads, POSIX Pthreads, and Win32
		   threads;  

        . Explicit dynamic linking
                -- e.g., dlopen/dlsym on UNIX and LoadLibrary/GetProc
		   on Win32;

        . Memory-mapped files and shared memory management
		-- e.g., BSD mmap(), SYSV shared memory, and Win32
		   shared memory;

        . System V IPC 
                -- e.g., shared memory, semaphores, message queues.

The OS Adaptation Layer shields the upper levels of ACE from platform
dependencies associated with the underlying OS interfaces.

Frameworks and Class Categories

ACE also contains a higher-level network programming framework that
integrates and enhances the lower-level C++ wrappers.  This framework
supports the dynamic configuration of concurrent distributed services
into applications.  The framework portion of ACE contains the
following class categories:

        . The Reactor
		-- Supports both Reactive and Proactive I/O;

        . The Service Configurator
		-- Support dynamic (re)configuration of objects;

        . The ADAPTIVE Service Executive
		-- A user-level implementation of System V STREAMS,
		   that supports modular integration of
		   hierarchically-related communicaion services;

	. Concurrency
		-- Various types of higher-level concurrency
		   control and synchronization patterns (such as
		   Polymorphic Futures and Active Objects);

	. Shared Malloc
		-- Components for managing dynamically allocation
		   of shared and local memory;

	. CORBA integration 
		-- Integrates ACE with CORBA implementations 
		   (such as single-threaded and multi-threaded
		   Orbix and Visibroker for C++).

Distributed Services and Components

Finally, ACE provides a standard library of distributed services that
are packaged as components.  These service components play two roles
in ACE:

	1. They provide reusable components for common distributed
	   system tasks such as logging, naming, locking, and time 
	   synchronization.

	2. They illustrate how to utilize ACE features such as the
	   Reactor, Service Configurator, Service Initialization,
	   Concurrency, and IPC components.
	   
ACE is currently being used in many commercial products including the
Bellcore Q.port ATM signaling software product, the Ericsson EOS
family of telecom switch monitoring applications, the Motorola Iridium
global mobile communications system, and enterprise-wide electronic
medical imaging systems for Kodak Health Imaging Systems and Siemens
medical engineering.

OBTAINING ACE

The current ACE release is provided as a tar file that is slightly
larger than 1.5 Meg compressed using GNU gzip.  ACE may be obtained
electronically from http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-obtain.html.
This release contains contains the source code, test drivers, and
example applications for C++ wrapper libraries and the higher-level
ACE network programming framework developed as part of the ADAPTIVE
project at the University of California, Irvine and at Washington
University.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING ACE

Please refer to the INSTALL file for information on how to build and
test the ACE wrappers.  The overall ACE release is very large (~1
Meg).  Therefore, I'm sorry, but I will be unable to distribute the
ACE wrappers via email.  The BIBLIOGRAPHY file contains information on
where to obtain articles that describe the ACE wrappers and the
ADAPTIVE system in more detail.

The current release has been tested extensively on Sun workstations
running Sun OS 4.1.x and Solaris 2.x (on both SPARC and Intel
platforms) using Sun C++ 4.x and GNU G++ 2.7.x.  The release has also
been ported to SCO UNIX, HP-UX, SGI, OSF/1, AIX, Linux, Windows NT and
Windows '95.  I expect that major portions of the release will port
easily to other platforms.  If you can help port ACE to other
platforms I'd appreciate it. 

ACE MAILING LIST

A mailing list is available for discussing bug fixes, enhancements,
and porting issues regarding ACE.  Please send mail to me at the
ace-users-request@cs.wustl.edu if you'd like to join the mailing list.

I would particularly like to thank Paul Stephenson, who worked with me
at Ericsson and is now at ObjectSpace.  Paul devised the recursive
Makefile scheme that underlies this distribution and also spent
countless hours with me discussing object-oriented techniques for
developing distributed application frameworks. 

Finally, I'd also like to thank Todd L. Montgomery
<tmont@cerc.wvu.edu>, fellow heavy metal head, for fulfilling his
quest to get ACE to compile with GCC!
