Fri Jan  4 15:50:42 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):
          On ACE::select-reported timeout or failure, set status to return
          a -1 to caller, not 0. Thanks to Vladimir Chovanec
          <Vladimir.CHOVANEC@asset.sk> for reporting this and sending a fix.

Fri Jan  4 08:31:49 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

	* tests/Thread_Manager_Test.cpp (test_task_record_keeping): Fixed
	  a typo in an expression on line 226.  Thanks to Harvinder
 	  Sawhney <harvindersawhney@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Fri Jan  4 05:51:22 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Future.{h,cpp}: Made the get() and ready() methods const.
	  Thanks to Ran Kohavi <ran@kashya.con> for reporting this.

Fri Jan  4 15:06:31 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/String_Base.h (operator=): Add <CHAR> to ACE_String_Base
          return type. Fixes compile error on IBM C/C++.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):
          If SSL_get_error() returns SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL and it's EWOULDBLOCK,
          don't blindly set both read and write handles for select. Check
          if SSL is indicating SSL_want_write() and set the proper handle.
          Also, don't ACE_ASSERT SSL_pending before return... if there's
          an SSL handshake screw-up (like someone trying to break in)
          just report the failure, don't abort/crash.

Wed Jan 02 13:27:09 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/INET_Addr.h:
	* ace/INET_Addr.cpp: Removed tabs and trailing whitespaces.

	* ace/FILE_Connector.h,
	* ace/OS.h (ACE_OS): Clarified the weak semantics of O_APPEND

 	  reporting this.

Wed Jan  2 12:43:00 2002  John Aughey  <jha@aughey.com>

	* ace/INET_Addr.h
	* ace/INET_Addr.cpp : Added set_host_name method and moved
	  relevant code into this method.  Changed signature of
	  set_address method to take a void pointer rather than a
	  char *.

Wed Jan  2 12:30:01 2002  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/RB_Tree.i
	* tests/RB_Tree_Test.cpp : added check for valid current node to
          forward_i and reverse_i methods of iterator base class.  Thanks to
          Craig L. Ching <cching@mqsoftware.com> for reporting this!

Wed Jan  2 08:19:18 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

	* tests/README: Clarify that run_test.pl should be used rather
	  the run_tests.sh.

	* tests/run_tests.bat: Clarify that run_test.pl should be used
	  on Win9x.  Thanks to Edward A Thompson <ed4becky_2000@yahoo.com>
 	  for prompting this.

Wed Jan  2 07:37:01 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

Tue Jan  2 11:39:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.i:
          Added missing ACE_UNUSED_ARG in ACE_OS::event_timedwait

Tue Jan  1 15:36:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU: Added support
          for the buildbits=64 make option.

Tue Jan  1 20:05:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Name_Request_Reply.{h,cpp}:
          Changed type of 3 constructor arguments from size_t to ACE_UINT32
          because the members in which these arguments are stored are also
          of type ACE_UINT32

        * ace/OS.i
          In ACE_OS::umask method, changed the type in the ACE_OSCALL_RETURN
          macro from int to mode_t because that is the return type of the
          method

Tue Jan  1 08:47:25 2002  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@siesta.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Thread.h: Clarify how the ACE_Thread_Adapter is deleted

 	  <prez@srealm.net.au> for reporting this confusion.

Tue Jan  1 14:09:26 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/Map_Manager/test_hash_map_manager.cpp:
          Made this example compiling when ACE_USES_WCHAR is set

        * Makefile.bor:
          Added examples directory because all examples for which there are
          BCB makefiles now build when ACE_USES_WCHAR is set

Tue Jan  1 00:02:12 2002  Nanbor Wang <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.vcp: Added String_Base_Const.*.
