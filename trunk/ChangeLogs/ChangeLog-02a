	* configure.in:

	  Only define ACE_HAS_XT if both the Xt headers and libraries are
	  available.  Previously, the existence of the Xt libraries was
	  not part of the XtReactor enable criterion.

	* m4/compiler.m4 (ACE_SET_COMPILER_FLAGS):

	  Added C++ preprocessor flag documentation and trivial support.

	  Many AIX related compiler flag updates.

	* m4/platform.m4 (ACE_SET_PLATFORM_MACROS):

	  Moved/consolidated platform-specific settings from configure.in
	  to here.

	  Improved AIX support (updates, fixes, etc).

Fri Jan  7 10:48:55 2000  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/run_all_list.pm: Added missing commas.

Thu Jan 06 22:26:42 2000  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/OS.i (fcntl): There was a special fcntl() for Win32.
	  Removed that special version and added ACE_LACKS_FCNTL to
	  config-win32-common.h.

	* ace/ACE.cpp: Removed the non-"_n" versions of send/recv
	  functions that deal with message blocks.  Since we deal with
	  continuation chains and linked messages, we are essentially
	  dealing with "_n" style functions.  Also, improved the error
	  handling in case of timeouts.

	* ace/Strategies_T.cpp
	  (ACE_Cached_Connect_Strategy::connect_svc_handler): If an error
	  occurs while activating the handler, the <activate_svc_handler>
	  method will close the handler.  We must set the handler to zero
	  to make sure that the higher layer doesn't try to close the
	  handler again!

Thu Jan  6 15:00:56 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

	* aclocal.m4:
	* configure:
	* All Makefile.in:

	  Removed these files.  They are automatically generated, so they
	  should not be in the repository.  Thanks to David for pointing
	  out that my ACE+autoconf updates caused CVS conflicts when
	  updating existing workspaces.

Wed Jan  5 10:09:35 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

	* ace/Dirent.h: Added an ACE_Export on the ACE_Dirent class.  I'm
	  surprised this hasn't been a problem before...  Thanks to
 	  Dominic Williams <dom@connected-place.co.uk> for indirectly
 	  motivating this change.

	* ace/SString.h: Updated the documentation for the various string
	  wrapper facades to clarify that they don't perform any locking.
	  Thanks to Jerry Jiang <javalist@21cn.com> for motivating this.

Wed Jan 05 09:53:04 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SOCK_Stream.[hi] (sendv_n): added const to iov[]
          argument declaration.  Thanks to Rob Ruff <rruff@scires.com>
          for reporting that TAO's AV service failed to compile
          with Sun CC 5.0 because of this.

Tue Jan  4 15:06:41 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Added note that asks user to use stock ACE build procedure
          detailed in ACE-INSTALL.html in the event that the configure
          script fails.

Tue Jan  4 14:40:17 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          AIX defines "off64_t" as its 64 bit offset type.  Typedef
          ACE_LOFF_T as that type if ACE_HAS_LLSEEK or ACE_HAS_LSEEK64 is
          defined.  This should correct a problem that occurred during an
          AIX configure script run.  Thanks to Mike Winter for pointing
          this out.

Tue Jan  4 14:09:51 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Fixed test that checks if sched.h is needed for thread
          scheduling definitions.  This should correct problems discovered
          on RedHat 6.1 installations.  Thanks to

          Improved sys_nerr and sys_errlist[] tests by checking for
          external global variables in libraries.  This should correct a
          problem discovered in an AIX configure script run.  Thanks to
          Mike Winter for providing feedback.

Tue Jan  4 13:23:26 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config: Updated the documentation for the various
          open() methods and the constructors.  Thanks to Christopher
          Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jan  4 12:58:54 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

          man/man3/Makefile.am and man/html/Makefile.am previously weren't
          being labelled.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

Mon Jan  3 21:01:53 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests: Updated the
          README file so it'll point to the right documentation!  Thanks
          to John Buttitto for reporting this.

Tue Jan 04 07:26:24 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.11 released.

Mon Jan 03 07:34:38 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): return res instead of *res, because
          the function returns a struct tm *, not a struct tm.

Sun Jan  2 11:02:54 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): We should return *res rather than
          *result to make the behavior correct for Win32.  Thanks to
          J. Afshar <jafshar@vignette.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 02 00:50:00 2000  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.{cpp, h, i}
          ace/Signal.cpp
          ace/Synch.cpp
          ace/config-psos-diab-ppc.h: Added support for native mutexs,
          condition variables, and thread-specific storage in pSOS.  Native
          pSOS mutexes, where available, support several cool features,
          including lock recursion and priority inheritance protocol and
          priority ceiling protocol support.

Sat Jan 01 09:16:39 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ChangeLog,Makefile: moved to ChangeLog-99b.
