Fri Jul 27 12:18:49 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Fixed compile error - missing "" around
          's' for the %S case.

Fri Jul 27 11:07:26 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/OS.h:

          After conversation with Steve Huston, I am reverting his change
          pertaining to HPUX from "Tue Jul 10 18:15:39 2001  Steve Huston
          <shuston@riverace.com>".

Fri Jul 27 10:57:24 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram_Bcast.cpp:

          Fix the ACE_SOCK_Dgram_Bcast::mk_broadcast() which was completely
          broken on AIX.  The broadcast_client in docs/tutorials/008 now
          works with the help of this change.

Thu Jul 26 22:09:19 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Extend behavior so that all printf
          formatting conversion specifiers can be used with all legal
          ACE_Log_Msg format characters. This allows the caller to line
          up columns on any field, like line number or program name, or
          thread ID. Thanks to Paul Caffrey <pcaffrey@iel.ie> for
          motivating this extension.

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp: Added a new function, test_format_specs,
          that verifies the formatting. Right now it does not detect the
          correctness of the strings produced - they have to be examined
          in the log file to check. This needs to be fixed still.

Thu Jul 26 11:48:16 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * bin/count_lines:
          Add a few new file types.

Wed Jul 25 23:49:43 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_g++.GNU:

          Fixed some missing defines in the Makefile for DEC Unix versions
          4.0D, 4.0E. We don't support or suggest this combination. Hence
          the oversight in missing the needed defines.

          Thanks to Martin Krumpolec <krumpo@pobox.sk> for reporting this.

Wed Jul 25 23:49:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:

          Remove extraneous rapi = 0.

Wed Jul 25 18:53:18 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * html/index.html:

          Added CORBA Security Service main page link to the list of
          documentation.

Wed Jul 25 17:41:43 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ltcf-c.sh:
        * ltcf-cxx.sh:
        * ltconfig:

          Removed these libtool related files.  New versions of libtool
          (GNU libtool >= 1.4b) no longer use them.

        * config.guess:
        * config.sub:
        * ltmain.sh:

          Removed these files.  We no longer need to keep custom copies
          lieing around since libtool 1.4b includes all of our local
          changes (i.e. our changes have been folded into the upstream
          libtool sources).

        * install-sh:
        * missing:
        * mkinstalldirs:

          Removed these files.  Automake will automatically add these when
          necessary.

Wed Jul 25 16:29:48 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.cpp: ACE-ified the code and fixed
          a number of ACE_DEBUG %p directives without a corresponding
          string. Also, closed a 2 handle-per-try handle leak, which
          may have affected test results on some platforms.
        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.h: Added a destructor to the
          test class - it's used to close the acceptor handle down.

Wed Jul 25 15:21:22 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          Fixed the _XOPEN_SOURCE checking to _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500 to fix
          incorrect declaration of prototype. This fixes the warnings when
          compiling with gcc-3.0. Thanks to Ossama for suggesting the fix.

Wed Jul 25 08:05:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.h:
        * tests/Thread_Pool_Reactor_Resume_Test.cpp: Fixed a subtle race
          condition. This hardly showed up in many of our daily
          builds. The race condition had to be fixed to show the users of
          the cautious approach that one needs to take if they are
          resuming the handle in the application itself.

Tue Jul 24 16:41:57 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Thread_Manager.cpp :
          Added "&& ! defined (ACE_HAS_PACE)" ifdefs to already existing
          #if defined (VXWORKS) sections of code to get ACE_HAS_PACE to
          compile on VxWorks.

        * ace/OS.i :
        * ace/OS.cpp:
          Fixed formatting of some comments and added needed PACE
          calls for ACE_HAS_PACE on VxWorks.

        * ace/OS.h :
          Put #if !defined guards around the ACE_THR_PRI* macros
          so that we can define them in the config*.h files if
          they need to be corrected. For instance, ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_MIN
          has a different value on SunOS 5.8 than it does on SunOS 5.7,
          i.e., -20 vs. 0 respectively.

          Also, added some needed typedefs and #define for ACE_HAS_PACE
          on VxWorks and updated some comments concerning ACE_OS::thr_create
          flags.

        * ace/Sched_Params.cpp (priority_min, priority_max):
          Changed to return correct thread priority min/max for
          Solaris threads. We now use the ACE_PRI_THR* macros
          for these values while still calling ACE_OS::priority_control
          for process and LWP priorities.

        * ace/config-sunos5.8.h:
          Added setting of ACE_THR_PRI_OTHER_MIN to be correct
          for SunOS 5.8.

Tue Jul 24 13:47:32 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h (ACE_SSL_Asynch_Stream):
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp: Added a open () method that
          matches the signature of ACE_Service_Handler. This should fix
          the warnings in Borland builds that complain about hiding
          the virtual functions.

Tue Jul 24 10:56:04 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/generate_doxygen.pl (TAO_DOCS):

          Added "tao_security" and "tao_ssliop" Doxygen configurations to
          the list of documentation to generate.

Tue Jul 24 07:45:03 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Containers_T: Fixed some problems with the lack of
          const for the ACE_DLList and ACE_Double_Linked_List classes.
          Thanks to Michael Kircher for reporting this.

        * ace/config-cygwin32-common.h: Removed the ACE_LACKS_FORK
          macro since this is apparently working on Cygwin.  Thanks tj
          Stefan Kluehspies <Stefan.Kluehspies@gmx.net> for reporting
          this.

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h: Removed the #define _CLOCKID_T
          macro, which should now be handled by the following change.

        * ace/OS.h: Added a #defined for _CLOCKID_T_.  Thanks to
          Stefan Kluehspies <Stefan.Kluehspies@gmx.net> for
          reporting this.

Tue Jul 24 11:10:59 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h:

          Fix the compile errors seen on gcc-3.0 with -pedantic and
          -Wno-long-long. This should fix all the errors.

Tue Jul 24 10:07:31 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU:

          Add an optimize override to 0 for g++ 3.0.  The compiler breaks on
          a tremendous amount of files, even with -O.

Tue Jul 24 10:04:52 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.cpp:

          Corrected a run-time error on Tru64 with gcc.  Any executable
          that called ACE_INET_Addr::get_host_name() would core dump.
          This was caused by the call to ACE_OS::gethostbyaddr_r().

Tue Jul 24 08:20:02 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:

          Change -O2 to -O.  The optimizer seems to be a tiny
          bit broken, which is demonstrated by a few TAO and orbsvcs
          tests.

Mon Jul 23 17:38:46 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * etc/tao_security.doxygen:
        * etc/tao_ssliop.doxygen:

          New Doxygen files for TAO's CORBA security libraries.

Mon Jul 23 13:48:26 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/MEM_Connector.cpp (connect):

          Disable non-blocking on the stream after its handle has been
          set.  Previously, non-blocking was disabled on an uninitialized
          MEM_Stream, after which the handle was set (i.e. initializing
          the stream).  In order to properly disable non-blocking on a
          stream, its handle must be set first since ioctl() operations
          are typically performed on the underlying stream handle.

Mon Jul 23 13:06:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (event_handling): Corrected the loop check
          to account for a zero ACE_Time_Value *, avoiding a crash in
          tests/Reactor_Timer_Test, as well as any other program that
          called ACE_Reactor::handle_events with a zero timer pointer.

Mon Jul 23 10:39:55 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.h: Added /**/ between #include and <sys/times.h> to
          avoid warning from CE compiler.

        * ace/ace_dll.vcp: Added Obchunk.cpp to the project.

Sun Jul 22 08:19:43 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h: ADded a #define for_CLOCKID_T.  Thanks to
          Christophe Galerne <christophgalerne@earthlink.net> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/Log_Record.cpp (priority_names_): Added commas after the
          'ACE_LIB_TEXT ("LM_UNK(04000)")' lines.  Thanks to Steve Harris
          <harris_s@ociweb.com> for reporting this.

Sat Jul 21 19:56:08 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Map_T.{h,i}: Made current_value() a const member function.
          Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Fri Jul 20 10:16:46 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Connector.cpp (create_AST): Replaced some calls to
          sh->get_handle () with a cached value of handle.  This fixes a
          bug with gcc 2.96 on Tornado 2.1/VxWorks for SuperH.  Thanks to
          Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de> for reporting this.

        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-acceptor.cpp:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Handle_Thr_Stream.cpp:
        * examples/Connection/non_blocking/CPP-connector.cpp:  Changed the
          SH macro to SVH to avoid clashes with a macro in VxWorks.
          Thanks to Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de> for reporting this.

Thu Jul 19 06:55:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-g++-common.h: Version 2.96 of g++ on VxWorks
          is missing auto_ptr, so let's add the ACE_LACK_AUTO_PTR flag
          there.  Thanks to Frank Wolf for suggesting this.

Fri Jul 20 09:47:38 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp: Fixed WinCE errors.  CE does not support
          UNIX_Syslog.

Thu Jul 19 22:39:32 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/MEM_Stream_Test.cpp:
        * ace/MEM_IO.h:
        * ace/MEM_IO.i:
        * ace/MEM_IO.cpp: On non-Win32 platforms, disable multithreaded
          MEM_IO if _ACE_USE_SV_SEM is defined.

Thu Jul 19 15:25:11 2001  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/MEM_Acceptor.i (mmap_prefix):

          Fix case where a null pointer is passed in.

Thu Jul 19 06:55:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Connector.cpp (connect_svc_handler): Missed one change...
          Thanks to Bala for reporting this!

        * include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU (HOST_DIR): Added
           support for the SH7700 and SH7700LE.  Thanks to Frank Wolf
          <WolfF@Becker.de> for reporting this.

        * ace/OS.i (truncate): Make sure to close the handle that we
          opens.  Thanks to Lothar for reporting this.

        * ace/Connector.cpp: Changed the SH macro to SVH to avoid clashes
          with a macro in VxWorks.  Thanks to Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de>
          for reporting this.

Wed Jul 18 13:15:06 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp (scandir_emulation): Removed the calls to the
          ACE_ERROR_RETURN macros to avoid dependencies on ACE_Log_Msg
          from within the ACE_OS layer.  Thanks to Bala for pointing this
          out!

        * ace/ACE.{h,cpp}: Added a new wrapper method for ACE_OS::select()
          that uses ACE_Handle_Set *'s rather than fd_set *'s.  This is
          motivated by work Steve Huston and I are doing on our new book
          "C++ Network Programming: Resolving Complexity with ACE and
          Patterns."

        * ace/Malloc_T.i (release): Removed an unnecessary "else" to
          make gcc 2.96 happy.  Thanks to Frank Wolf <fwolf@gum.de> for
          reporting this.

        * Happy birthday to me and Angelo Corsaro!

Tue Jul 17 00:34:40 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/SString.h (ACE_Tokenizer): Make sure that the data members
          are protected, not private...  Thanks to Martin Krumpolec for
          reporting this (again)!

Wed Jul 18 16:40:56 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (program_name): Undid the following changes:

          ChangeLogTag:Tue Jul 10 11:32:26 2001  Tibor Kiss

          Tibor will be looking into this further since this change
          currently causes shutdown problems on Win2000.

Wed Jul 18 15:59:03 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-tru64.h:

          Removed _LIBC_POLLUTION_H. It seems that this macro is causing
          problems for some users.  Thanks to Pierre Oberson
          <oberson@nagra-kudelski.ch> for prompting this fix.

Tue Jul 17 13:00:11 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_test.lst: Enabled the MEM_Stream test on Linux.

Mon Jul 16 14:59:32 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Memory_Pool.h (ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool): Added a comment
          that discourages developer from using the ACE_Shared_Memory_Pool
          and points them to the ACE_MMAP_Memory_Pool instead.  Thanks to
          Johnny Chen <jchen@huawei.com> for motivating this.

        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp (readdir_emulation): Fixed a handle leak
          in the event that errors occur.  Thanks to Kevin Burge
          <kcburge@systemware-inc.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp (open): Add an ACE_const_cast()
          to the program name for platforms like LynxOS whose openlog()
          method is char * rather than const char *.  Thanks to Bala for
          reporting this.

Sun Jul 15 11:06:33 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log.cpp: Fixed the implementation so that
          it's consistent with the new program_name() features.  Thanks to
          Chris Kohloff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for this fix.

Sun Jul 15 11:04:26 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL.dsp:
          Removed references to $OPENSSL_ROOT, the user should configure
          those in the Tools -> Option -> Directories tab.

Fri Jul 13 23:02:46 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp:

          Only support asynchronous SSL streams when using OpenSSL >
          0.9.5a.  The BIO method signatures changed in OpenSSL 0.9.6.

Fri Jul 13 22:48:56 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp (methods_ACE):

          Removed excess element in aggregate initializer.

Fri Jul 13 22:29:01 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp (print_error):

          The OpenSSL ERR_error_string_n() function is only supported in
          OpenSSL 0.9.6 or better.

Fri Jul 13 14:59:18 2001  Alexander Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com>

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h (ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Result):
        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp (set_error, set_bytes_transferred):

          Added new methods set_error() and set_bytes_transferred().
          Needed for below changes and new asynchronous SSL stream
          implementation.

        * ace/WIN32_Proactor.cpp (handle_events):

          Fixed error handling semantics so that it is consistent with the
          POSIX Proactor error handling semantics.

          (post_completion):

          Pass the amount of bytes transferred and the completion key to
          the Win32 PostQueuedCompletionStatus() function.  The error, if
          any, will later be extracted in the handle_events() method.

Fri Jul 13 15:59:45 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * netsvcs/servers/main.cpp (main): The server was always outputing
          LM_DEBUG information, even when the program was not run with the
          -d command line argument.  Therefore, changed the following
          lines from:

          if (ACE::debug () == 0)
            ACE_Log_Msg::disable_debug_messages ();

          to:

          if (ACE::debug () == 0)
            ACE_LOG_MSG->priority_mask (~LM_DEBUG, ACE_Log_Msg::PROCESS);

          Thanks to Jerry D. De Master <jdemaster@rite-solutions.com> for
          reporting this fix.

Fri Jul 13 12:16:03 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_BIO.cpp:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.h:
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Asynch_Stream.cpp:

          New asynchrounous SSL stream implementation contributed by
          Alexander Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com>.

        * ace/SSL/ACE_SSL.dsp:
        * ace/SSL/Makefile:
        * ace/SSL/Makefile.bor:

          Added new asynchronous SSL stream source files to these
          Makefiles and project files.

Fri Jul 13 09:40:08 2001  Jerry D. De Master <jdemaster@rite-solutions.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg.*,
          ace/Logging_Strategy.*,
          ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.*:
          Applied patches to ACE_Log_Msg, ACE_Logging_Strategy, and
          ACE_Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog that are required to add the program
          name logging strategy option ('n') and to initialize the UNIX
          syslog facility with the program name.  Also included are Boris
          Kolpackov <bosk@ipmce.ru> patches for ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_TOTALLY
          to ACE_Logging_Strategy.

Thu Jul 12 19:54:27 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * examples/Registry/test_registry_update.cpp (main):

          Fixed unused argument warning.

Thu Jul 12 19:57:12 2001  Frank Hunleth  <fhunleth@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

          Added TAO/tests/RTCORBA/ORB_init to the auto run list.

Thu Jul 12 17:11:35 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/nightlybuilds/builds.lst (WEB):

          Temporarily removed the IA-64 build till some issues get sorted
          out.

Thu Jul 12 06:01:03 2001  John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net>

        * netsvcs/lib/Server_Logging_Handler.cpp:
          Added an an additional #define in config-macosx.h called
          ACE_HAS_MACOSX_DYLIB, and checked to see if this was _not_
          defined before instantiating the offending template in
          Server_Logging_Handler.cpp.  OS X has this thing about .dylibs
          (OS X version of .so) where they can't have any duplicate
          symbols, which is why libnetsvcs wasn't building on OS X
          earlier.  This fixes that.

        * include/makeincludes/platform-macosx.GNU: Added -lACE to the
          LIBS line, which fixed the majority of the build problems.

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Added the ACE_HAS_MACOSX_DYLIB #define
          mentioned above.

Thu Jul 12 06:01:03 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TLI_Connector.cpp (complete): Changed ACE_OS::t_rcvconnect()
          to simply t_rcvconnect().  Thansk to Andreas Geisler for
          reporting this.

Thu Jul 12 09:43:36 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/FILE_Connector.h (ACE_FILE_Connector, connect):

          Removed the default O_EXCL flag I added a few days ago.  It is
          mostly useful for preventing symbolic link attacks in a
          directory with global write permissions.  Pass the
          responsibility of using the O_EXCL flag when necessary on to the
          application developer.

Wed Jul 11 22:31:50 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU (clean.local):

          Added ti_files to remove the template cache generated by KCC.

        * ace/TLI_Acceptor.cpp(open_new_endpoint):

          Fixed a small typo causing compilation errors under Tru64.

Wed Jul 11 13:06:33 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp: Changed the ostream test to close the
          under-test ostream file before trying to open it and read the
          contents. Avoids the "already open" error now that
          ACE_FILE_Connector includes O_EXCL by default, and avoids any
          potential file buffering issues reading an already-open file.

Wed Jul 11 08:31:02 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp:

          Wrapped a string literal with ACE_TEXT, to get rid of a Win2000
          WChar build error.

Wed Jul 11 06:41:43 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/TLI_Stream.cpp,
        * ace/TLI_Connector.cpp,
        * ace/TLI_Acceptor.cpp: Added enhancements so that the code would
          work on Win32.  Thanks to Andreas Geisler
          <Andreas.Geisler@erl9.siemens.de> for reporting this.

Tue Jul 10 19:26:15 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:

          Disabled generation of source browse information.  It was
          causing problems on some existing builds that didn't use it.

        * ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.cpp (ssl_accept):

          Removed certificate verification code.  It is up to the
          application, not the ACE_SSL library, to perform proper
          certificate verification.

Tue Jul 10 23:02:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * tests/Log_Msg_Test.cpp:
          Fix test so it doesn't open output file to write to twice.
          Thanks to Ossama for finding it.

Tue Jul 10 19:10:19 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Corrected the mis-applied patch for ace.icc in
          Mon Jul 09 19:12:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Tue Jul 10 16:01:52 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Sangeetha Ramadurai <Sangeetha.Ramadurai@geind.ge.com> to
          the hall of fame.

Tue Jul 10 18:15:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp (event_handling): Move the logic for
          noticing that the wait timed out, but did not expire any
          timers, into this function. Will remove it from Reactor.cpp,
          to properly move the fix into handle_events() rather than
          needing to call run_reactor_event_loop to get it right.
        * ace/Select_Reactor_T.cpp - still need to add similar logic here.

        * ace/config-sunos5.6.h: Re the following:
          Mon Jul  2 15:26:32 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>
          Replaced ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM, and left ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM out.
          Solaris does indeed have POSIX semaphores in 2.6 and later, but
          requires the changes to OS.i below to work right.

        * ace/OS.h: For ACE_PROC_PRI_OTHER_MIN (and MAX), on HP-UX,
          convert the HP-UX priority value to the POSIX range.

        * ace/OS.i (ACE_OS::sema_init, named POSIX semaphore): On Solaris
          and HP-UX, the name of a POSIX semaphore needs to start with
          a slash (further restricted on Solaris). Enforce that here by
          prepending a slash, or by chopping off parts of the name.

Tue Jul 10 16:08:04 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:

          Fixed the default flags so that it enables the user to override
          settings. Now that the long pending fix to wrapper_macros.GNU is
          through, this should work fine now.

Tue Jul 10 13:37:31 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp (readdir_emulation):

          Removed the hard cast to char* of one of the two arguments in
          a call to strcpy. In the WChar win32 build, this cast was
          causing the source and target strings to be of different widths.

Tue Jul 10 11:32:26 2001  Tibor Kiss  <tkiss@mindmaker.hu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp:
          Completed the ACE_Log_Msg::close method with the
          ACE_Thread::keyfree (log_msg_tss_key_) and key_created_ = 0; to
          ensure restartability by multiple successive ACE::init and
          ACE::fini calls.  This fix prevent leaks from occurring when
          ACE::init() and ACE::fini() are called multiple times.

Tue Jul 10 11:12:00 2001  Chris Gill <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.{h, inl}: refactored XDIR, dirent usage for pSOS -
          user is no longer responsible for buffer deallocation after each
          readdir call, only for passing the pointer returned from opendir
          into closedir when all done.  ACE_DIR structure is now used
          consistently for all pSOS dirent calls.

Tue Jul 10 06:06:07 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@ace.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Repository.h: Updated the insert() comment to
          clarify the return values.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for
          suggesting this.

        * ace/Service_Repository.{h,i}: Made the current_size() and
          total_size() methods const.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for
          suggesting this.

        * ace/Service_Repository.h: Fixed a typo in the comments.  Thanks
          to Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Tue Jul 10 08:39:04 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:

          Added the macro ACE_LACKS_UNIX_SYSLOG.

Tue Jul 10 08:26:57 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp:

          Added a macro, ACE_LACKS_SETLOGMASK, for platforms that have
          syslog, but don't have setlogmask().

        * ace/config-chorus.h:

          ChorusOS 4.0.1 happens to be one of them.

Tue Jul 10 09:00:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS_Dirent.h
          Made the member 'd_name' of the 'dirent' struct non-const, because
          BCB had problems with it

Mon Jul 09 22:41:43 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU (exceptions):

          Include platform_macros.GNU before the default for "exceptions"
          is set.  This fixes a problem where the default native
          exceptions setting in platform_linux.GNU was not set due to the
          fact that it was previously set in wrapper_macros.GNU.  Thanks
          to Hans Utz <hans.utz@informatik.uni-ulm.de> for tracking down
          the problem.

Mon Jul  9 16:40:02 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp (ACE_Dirent_Selector):

          Correct order of initialization of members to match order of
          declaration.  Fixes a warning issued from GCC.

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.inl:

          Added missing RCS ID keyword.  Fuzz was whining about the lack
          of it.

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.h:

          Corrected some Doxygen comments.

Mon Jul 09 19:12:42 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Added Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog and Log_Msg_NT_Event_Log
          modules to the LOGGING component. Added Dirent_Selector to the
          UTILS component.

Mon Jul  9 15:59:56 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-lynxos.h:
          Added ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP since LynxOS doesn't seem to have
          this.

Mon Jul  9 15:28:29 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp:
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.h:

          Added ACE_INLINE guards around inclusion of Dirent_Selector.inl.

        * ace/ace_dll.dsp:
        * ace/ace_lib.dsp:

          Added Dirent_Selector.{h,i,cpp} to these projects.

Mon Jul  9 06:52:09 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Makefile.bor (OBJFILES): Added the Dirent_Selector.obj file.

        * tests/Dirent_Test.cpp: Integrated a new test for the
          ACE_Dirent_Selector class.

        * ace/Makefile (UTILS_FILES),
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.h,
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.inl,
        * ace/Dirent_Selector.cpp: Added support for a C++ wrapper facade that
          encapsulates ACE_OS_Dirent::scandir().  Thanks to Rich Newman for
          contributing this, as well.

        * ace/OS_Dirent.h,
        * ace/OS_Dirent.inl,
        * ace/OS_Dirent.cpp: Added support for the scandir() feature, which
          makes it possible to selectively pick which files in a directory
          to iterate over.  Also fixed a bug in the emulation of dirent.
          Thanks to Rich Newman <RNewman@directv.com> for contributing
          these fixes.

Mon Jul 09 14:39:50 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (thr_getprio and thr_setprio): Changed these two
          function such that if we are on Solaris and we have pthreads
          enabled, we should use the pthread calls rather than the native
          Solaris calls.  The reasons for choosing the pthread calls is
          due to following problems with the native calls:

          - thr_getprio() is evil because on Solaris 5.8, a thread with
          priority -20 (SCHED_OTHER) is reported to have priority 80.

          - thr_setprio() is evil because it cannot set the negative
          priorities on Solaris 5.8.

          - Also, thr_setprio() cannot change the priority of a thread
          with negative priority to a positive priority on Solaris 5.8
          (even though there is no error reported and thr_getprio() shows
          that the change happened but pthread_getschedparam() shows that
          no change happened).

          - In addition, suppose a thread of policy SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO
          uses thr_setprio() to reset its priority, the priority will be
          reset but the scheduling policy will be dropped to SCHED_OTHER.
          This happens with both Solaris 5.7 and Solaris 5.8.

Mon Jul  9 13:33:43 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU:
          Change PACE path to start at $PACE_ROOT rather than $ACE_ROOT/PACE
          since the latter is not as flexible. Defined PACE_ROOT if not
          already defined. Also, added inclusion of PACE library for VxWorks
          even when inlining since not all the PACE functions should be
          inlined.

Mon Jul 09 10:59:22 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * THANKS:

          Added Mouna Seri <seri@crhc.uiuc.edu> to the hall of fame.

Mon Jul  9 11:10:44 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-win32-msvc-5.h:
        * ace/config-win32-msvc-6.h:

          Added conditional definitions for ACE_LD_DECORATOR_STR
          "mfc" and "mfcd" so that the MFC release and debug versions
          of libraries can be dynamically loaded in the same way that
          the non-MFC release and debug versions are. Thanks to
          Francois Bernier <fbernier@gel.ulaval.ca> for suggesting
          this enhancement.

Mon Jul 09 11:31:12 2001  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/pre.h
        * include/makeinclude/compiler.bor

          Removed the disabling of the compiler warning 'parameter never
          used'. Unused parameters are handled by ACE_UNUSED_ARG macro.
          A missing ACE_UNUSED_ARG is now shown as warning in the BCB build
          log.

Sun Jul 08 11:26:23 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (mkstemp):
        * ace/OS.i (mkstemp):

          New mkstemp() wrapper.  It is assumed to be available on the
          given platform, unless ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP is defined.

        * ace/FILE_Connector.h:

          Added O_EXCL to the default flags.  This is a security hole
          fix.

        * ace/FILE_Connector.cpp (connect):

          If mkstemp() is available, then use it to create a temporary
          file rather than mktemp() (via ACE_FILE_Addr) since mktemp() is
          susceptible to a denial-of-service attack.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
        * ace/config-vxworks5.x.h:

          mkstemp() is not supported on MS Windows and VxWorks.  Define
          ACE_LACKS_MKSTEMP in these headers.

Sun Jul  8 08:13:12 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h: Added a comment explaining what
          the ACE_HAS_REACTOR_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE macro means.  Thanks to
          Kobi Cohen-Arazi <kobic@bvr.co.il> for motivating this.

Sat Jul  7 18:53:49 2001  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:

          Revert the changes made to this file. Please see the file for a
          lengthy description.

Fri Jul 06 21:53:26 2001  Christopher Kohlhoff  <chris@kohlhoff.com>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h:
          Reverted addition of ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION.

Fri Jul  6 19:55:23 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Reactor/Multicast: Adding the support for UNIX Syslog
          broke this example because LOG_DEBUG was suddenly defined as a
          macro (it's in syslog.h).  I've fixed this by renaming the LOG_
          enums to LM_ instead.  Thanks to Bala for reporting this.

Fri Jul 06 20:23:41 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Refcoutned_Auto_Ptr.i (null): Change const_cast<> to
          ACE_const_cast() to build on older compilers, like IBM C/C++ 3.6.6.

Fri Jul 06 20:13:29 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Name_Handler.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Server_Logging_Handler_T.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Token_Handler.cpp:

          More ACE_DEBUG disables.

Fri Jul  6 15:55:54 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * ace/OS.h (ACE_FD_SETSIZE):

          Integrated patch from Jody Hagins <jody@atdesk.com>.  Set the
          default reactor file descriptor set size to be an integer
          constant rather than a preprocessor constant.  Some third party
          software #undef FD_SETSIZE in their header files, causing build
          problems in ACE.

Fri Jul 06 18:20:39 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp: #if 0'd out a bunch of
          ACE_DEBUG statements that aren't appropriate for use in commercial
          logging. These can be #if 1'd if there's some doubt while debugging
          this stuff, but they aren't useful once debugged, and are
          distracting since they're interespersed with application records.

Fri Jul  6 13:40:20 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.cpp: Fixed a warning in g++.

Fri Jul 06 11:39:41 2001  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/INET_Addr.h: Clarified (and improved doxygenation) of
          constructor and set() methods regarding byte orders.

        * tests/Max_Default_Port_Test.icc: New file for this test.
        * tests/tests.icp: Added Max_Default_Port_Test

Fri Jul  6 08:36:20 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * netsvcs/Makefile: Don't build this if ACE_COMPONENTS does not
          contain Other.  The netsvcs library requires Naming_Context.

Fri Jul  6 05:44:13 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Makefile (LOGGING_FILES): Added support for
          Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.

        * ace/Log_Msg_UNIX_Syslog.{h,cpp}:
        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp,
        * ace/OS.h: Added support for a new UNIX syslog backend for the
          ACE_Log_Msg class.  Thanks to Jerry D. De Master
          <jdemaster@rite-solutions.com> and Robert Davidson
          <robert@rdavidson.freeserve.co.uk>.

        * ace/SOCK_Dgram.h: Fixed a typo in one of the send() method
          comments.  Thanks to Alain Decamps <Alain.Decamps@PIDPA.be> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Added a new file courtesy of John
          Zorko so that things will work on MacOSX.

          Fixes that were required for fixing bug 575. Merged in from
          branch bug_575_stage_2.

Thu Jul  5 23:09:29 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp (ACE_InputCDR): Fixed a long standing bug in
          the branch. This caused the DSI_Gateway test to fail. The
          problem was from setting the write pointer to a wrong position
          during the construction.

Thu Jul  5 14:39:45 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Merged with the main trunk and moved it to a new branch by name
          bug_575_stage_2.

Thu Jun 28 15:25:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.h (ACE_Reactor):
        * ace/Reactor.cpp: Added a new method resumable_handler () to the
          reactor interface. This would indicate whether the application
          can take advantage by resuming the handlers themselves or
          not. Not all reactors can allow this feature.

        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h:
        * ace/Reactor_Impl.cpp: Added a pure virtual function so that all
          the implementations can decide whether the handlers are
          resumable or not.

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h:
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.h:
        * ace/TP_Reactor.cpp:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h:
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp:Implemented resumable_handlers ().

Sun Jun 24 11:25:07 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Created this file. Got the whole stuff in ace to a new branch by
          name bug_575_stage_1. This ChangeLog file will be in branch
          bug_575.

Fri Jun 22 16:52:13 2001  Balachandran Natarajan <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/CDR_Stream.cpp: Changed the copy constructor for the
          ACE_InputCDR's. Instead of duplicating the ACE_Data_Block we
          now use the new copy constructor in the ACE_Message_Block.

        * ace/Message_Block.h:
        * ace/Message_Block.cpp: Added a new copy constructor to the
          ACE_Message_Block. This copy constructor does a deep copy from
          the data block if the data block of the incoming message block
          is on the stack or does a shallow copy of the data block (by
          incrementing the ref count) if it is on the heap.

        END of entries from bug_575_stage_2.

Thu Jul  5 22:07:33 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added the new perl script in LongUpcalls
          in the  daily builds.

Thu Jul  5 20:36:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-win32-borland.h
            define ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION
        * tests/Token_Test.cpp
            Fix template instantiation problem.

Wed Jul  4 15:35:47 2001  Joe Hoffert  <joeh@cs.wustl.edu>

        * tests/run_tests.vxworks:
          Removed invocation of CDR_Array_Test. According to the ace
          config files the compiler we are using is pre 2.8 (i.e.,
          ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 is defined). Therefore don't run
          CDR_Array_Test since the Makefile doesn't build it (due to
          the ACE_HAS_GNUG_PRE_2_8 macro).

Wed Jul 04 14:26:10 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.h (class ACE_Acquire_Method): Moved the enums from
          the Reverse Lock class into ACE_Acquire_Method, a non-template
          class.  These enums should have been inside the reverse lock
          class, but some lame compilers cannot handle enums inside
          template classes.

Wed Jul 04 12:43:22 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.i (ACE_Reverse_Lock): Fully specified the
          ACE_ACQUIRE_METHOD type.

Tue Jul  3 15:43:25 2001  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp: Fixed a warning in g++.

Tue Jul  3 14:44:00 2001  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigues@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Borland C++ apparently
          does not support the "extern template class" Microsoft VC++
          proprietary extension.  Thanks to Chris Kohloff <chris@kohlhoff.com>
          for the fix.

Tue Jul 03 12:26:33 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.h (class ACE_Reverse_Lock): Added a parameter to the
          constructor of the reverse lock.  The ACE_ACQUIRE_METHOD
          parameter is used to indicate which acquire() method will be
          called on the real lock when the release() method is called on
          the reverse lock. REGULAR indicated the acquire() method, READ
          indicates the acquire_read() method, and WRITE indicates the
          acquire_write() method.  Note that the try_*() methods are not
          represented here because we have to make sure that the release()
          method on the reverse lock acquires a lock on the real lock.

          Thanks to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for suggesting this.

Tue Jul  3 06:20:13 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Reactor.h,
        * ace/Reactor_Impl.h,
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.cpp,
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.i,
        * ace/Select_Reactor_Base.h,
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.cpp,
        * ace/WFMO_Reactor.h: Added an enhancement that allows the
          Reactor to selectively purge event handlers from its
          notification queue according to their Reactor_Mask type.  Thanks
          to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for contributing this.

        * tests/Reactor_Notify_Test.cpp (run_notify_purge_test):
          Added a new set of tests for the new selective notification
          purging features of the Reactor.  Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edana@bandwiz.com> for contributing this.

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp: Removed the
          ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Result (handler, act, event, 0, 0, priority,
          signal_number), initializer since we no longer use virtual
          inheritance.  Thanks to Alexander Libman
          <alexander.libman@baltimore.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h: Removed the virtual inheritance from
          ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Result for the ACE_Asynch_Read_Stream_Result
          and ACE_Asynch_Read_Dgram_Result classes.  Thanks to Alexander
          Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h: Made the destructor of
          ACE_Refcounted_Auto_Ptr virtual so that users can override it
          locally.  Thanks to Jenny Kowald <jkowald@oz.agile.tv> for
          reporting this.

Tue Jul  3 09:40:59 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0_g++.GNU:

          Allow users to set options like debug, exceptions, ... without
          using override.

Tue Jul  3 08:38:47 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_dup_proactor.dsp:

          Fixed a mistake in the link to the ACE library.

Mon Jul  2 16:23:04 2001  Jeff Parsons <parsons@cs.wustl.edu>

        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_multiple_loops.dsp:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.dsp:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_proactor.dsw:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_timeout.dsp:
        *  examples/Reactor/Proactor/test_udp_proactor.dsp:

          Fixed settings on release version of test_udp_proactor.dsp,
          added it to the workspace, and removed unused file folders
          from the FileViews of the other projects.

Mon Jul  2 15:26:32 2001  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/config-sunos5.6.h: Removed ACE_HAS_POSIX_SEM and
          ACE_LACKS_NAMED_POSIX_SEM.  Thanks to Glenn Popelka
          <gpp@gpopelka.com> for helping track this down.

Mon Jul 02 11:45:57 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/make_release:

          Disabled bootstrapping of ACE's autoconf support.  It isn't
          ready for general use.  Doing so reduces the amount of
          confusion.  Thanks to Holger P. Krekel <krekel@merlinux.de> for
          motivating this change.

Mon Jul  2 13:18:14 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * Moved ACE-configurations.txt into the docs directory.  Also
          removed the hopelessly out of date BIBLIOGRAPHY file.

        * Moved all the ChangeLog-* files into the new ChangeLogs
          directory.  Thanks to Holger P. Krekel <krekel@merlinux.de> for
          this suggestion.

Mon Jul 02 11:20:52 2001  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * config.guess:
        * config.sub:

          Updated to the latest versions from the GNU FTP site.

Mon Jul 02 11:30:20 2001  Irfan Pyarali  <irfan@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Synch_T.i: Since the release() method on the reverse lock
          calls the simple acquire() method on the real lock, it is
          assumed that it is a simple acquire/release protocol with the
          real lock.  Therefore, I think all the other methods on the
          reverse lock tryacquire(), acquire_read(), acquire_write(),
          tryacquire_read(), tryacquire_write(), and
          tryacquire_write_upgrade() should not be allowed.  This falls in
          line with the original concept of using reverse locks with
          regular guards.

          Thanks to Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for pointing this out.

Mon Jul  2 11:17:37 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Profile_Timer.cpp:

          Cleaned up the conditional macros.  Added method bodies for
          ACE_Profile_Timer::get_rusage() and
          ACE_Profile_Timer::elapsed_rusage() when neither ACE_HAS_PRUSAGE_T
          nor ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE is defined.

        * Reverted the reverted changes in this entry.
          "Fri Jun 29 22:31:56 2001  Balachandran Natarajan
          <bala@cs.wustl.edu>".  These changes are ok, I just
          needed to fix the bug in Profile_Timer.cpp.

Mon Jul  2 09:40:45 2001  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU:

          Add the output filter to the linker to avoid the duplicate symbol
          warnings on AIX.

Mon Jul  2 05:40:54 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Logging_Strategy.cpp: Enhanced the code so that it works with
          ACE_LACKS_IOSTREAM_TOTALLY.  Thanks to Nir Drang <nir@bandwiz.com>
          and Edan Ayal <edana@bandwiz.com> for reporting this.

        * ace/SPIPE_Addr.cpp (set): Added a "+ 1" to the computation of
          the size of the SPIPE_Addr to account for the trailing NUL.
          Thanks to Oren Zeev-Ben-Mordehai <oren@phonedo.com> for
          reporting this.

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.{h,i}: Added support for a "null()"
          method to check if a refcounted auto ptr is NULL.  Thanks to
          Jenny Kowald <jkowald@oz.agile.tv> for reporting this.

        * ace/config-macosx.h,
        * ace/platform_macosx.GNU: Enhanced these files to support MacOSX.
          Thanks to John Zorko <j.zorko@att.net> for contributing this.

        * ace/Synch.h: Fixed the Doxygen documentation for all the
          removed_ fields, which where somehow messed up.  Thanks to
          Johnny Willemsen for reporting this.

Sun Jul  1 11:49:13 2001  Alexander Libman <alexander.libman@baltimore.com>

        * ace: Enhanced the POSIX and Sun Proactor implementations as
          follows:

          . POSIX_SIG_Proactor is now based on POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor

          . All classes ACE_POSIX_SIG_Asynch_XXXX are removed.
            POSIX_SIG_Proactor uses the ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Asynch_XXXX
            classes now.

          . ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::register_and_start_aio (...)
            now calls a new virtual method: int
            ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::allocate_aio_slot
            (ACE_POSIX_Asynch_Result *result).

          . The strategy of free slot allocation in SIG_Proactor is
            a bit different from AIOCB and SUN Proactors.  The
            allocate_aio_slot() method is responsible for setting
            notification information for aio request
            (SIGEV_NONE/SIGEV_SIGNAL).  For SIG_Proactor, the field
            aio_sigevent.sigev_value.sival_int now contains index of aiocb
            in the aiocb_list_, not a pointer.

          . The ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::find_completed_aio (int &error_status,
                                              int &return_status, size_t
                                              &index, size_t &count)
            parameter index defines initial slot to scan and the new
            parameter count tells us maximum number slots to scan.  On
            return: index contains value to start scan next time, count
            contains remained number of slots.  Scanning is performed in
            "wheel" style to allow all requests be handled with equal
            priorities.

          . ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor::check_max_aio_num () checks for
            max_number_files to open and tries to setup max_number_files
            equal to aiocb_max_size_. if we failed than cut off
            aiocb_max_size_ value to existing max_number_files.

          . POSIX_Proactor added member int os_id_ and constructor sets up
            os_id_ (compilation time + run_time function) to know
            OS(Sun/HP/Linux/...) and version.  We need such info for
            POSIX_SIG_Proactors to take into account the behavior of
            different OS.

          . Delivery of simulated/"post_completed" Asynch_Results
            (Timers, AsynchAccept,Wakeup ...).  As both Proactors have no
            reliable mechanizm for delivery "post_completed" results, so
            the reliable queue of "post_completed" results was
            implemented.  The new member of AIOCB Proactor
            ACE_Unbounded_Queue<ACE_POSIX_Asynch_Result *> result_queue_
            has been added.  Also added protected methods to the
            ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Proactor.

          . We had an error in all previous versions (from major ACE 5.1):
            post_completion (int how_many) does not guarantee that all
            completions will be delivered to the different threads running
            event_loop (sometimes several completions could be delivered
            to the one thread, in another thread performs during long time
            application_spesific_code ()).  Moreover, you can run now
            Proactor event_loop in any number of threads (more than
            SIGQUEMAX).

Sun Jul  1 11:49:13 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Reactor/Proactor: Integrated a test that exercises the
          support for asynchronous UDP operations.  Thanks to Roger Tragin
          <r.tragin@computer.org> for contributing this.

        * ace/Synch_T.i: Changed the implementations of all the
          acquire*() method to call release().  Thanks to Edan Ayal
          <edana@bandwiz.com> for reporting this.

Sat Jun 30 12:44:11 2001  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Connection/blocking/SPIPE-acceptor.cpp: Added better
          support for shutting down the server when a signal occurs.
          Thanks to Rich Newman <RNewman@directv.com> for this
          enhancement.
