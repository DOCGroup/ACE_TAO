	* ace/Dirent.h: Added an ACE_Export on the ACE_Dirent class.  I'm
	  surprised this hasn't been a problem before...  Thanks to
 	  Dominic Williams <dom@connected-place.co.uk> for indirectly
 	  motivating this change.

	* ace/SString.h: Updated the documentation for the various string
	  wrapper facades to clarify that they don't perform any locking.
	  Thanks to Jerry Jiang <javalist@21cn.com> for motivating this.

        * ace/SOCK_Stream.[hi] (sendv_n): added const to iov[]
          argument declaration.  Thanks to Rob Ruff <rruff@scires.com>
          for reporting that TAO's AV service failed to compile
          with Sun CC 5.0 because of this.

        * configure.in:

          Added note that asks user to use stock ACE build procedure
          detailed in ACE-INSTALL.html in the event that the configure
          script fails.

        * ace/OS.h:

          AIX defines "off64_t" as its 64 bit offset type.  Typedef
          ACE_LOFF_T as that type if ACE_HAS_LLSEEK or ACE_HAS_LSEEK64 is
          defined.  This should correct a problem that occurred during an
          AIX configure script run.  Thanks to Mike Winter for pointing
          this out.

Tue Jan  4 14:09:51 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * configure.in:

          Fixed test that checks if sched.h is needed for thread
          scheduling definitions.  This should correct problems discovered
          on RedHat 6.1 installations.  Thanks to

          Improved sys_nerr and sys_errlist[] tests by checking for
          external global variables in libraries.  This should correct a
          problem discovered in an AIX configure script run.  Thanks to
          Mike Winter for providing feedback.

Tue Jan  4 13:23:26 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Service_Config: Updated the documentation for the various
          open() methods and the constructors.  Thanks to Christopher
          Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for reporting this.

Tue Jan  4 12:58:54 2000  Ossama Othman  <othman@cs.wustl.edu>

        * Makefile (CONTROLLED_FILES):

          man/man3/Makefile.am and man/html/Makefile.am previously weren't
          being labelled.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

Mon Jan  3 21:01:53 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests: Updated the
          README file so it'll point to the right documentation!  Thanks
          to John Buttitto for reporting this.

Tue Jan 04 07:26:24 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.0.11 released.

Mon Jan 03 07:34:38 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): return res instead of *res, because
          the function returns a struct tm *, not a struct tm.

Sun Jan  2 11:02:54 2000  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.i (gmtime_r): We should return *res rather than
          *result to make the behavior correct for Win32.  Thanks to
          J. Afshar <jafshar@vignette.com> for reporting this.

Sun Jan 02 00:50:00 2000  Chris Gill  <cdgill@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.{cpp, h, i}
          ace/Signal.cpp
          ace/Synch.cpp
          ace/config-psos-diab-ppc.h: Added support for native mutexs,
          condition variables, and thread-specific storage in pSOS.  Native
          pSOS mutexes, where available, support several cool features,
          including lock recursion and priority inheritance protocol and
          priority ceiling protocol support.

Sat Jan 01 09:16:39 2000  David L. Levine  <levine@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ChangeLog,Makefile: moved to ChangeLog-99b.
