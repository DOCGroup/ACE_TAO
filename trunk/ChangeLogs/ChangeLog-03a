	* ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-02b:
	* ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-03a: New files having all the old ChangeLog
	  entries till 5.3.1.
	* ChangeLog: Shortened the changelog for ease of use. 

Thu Feb 20 10:35:15 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/Strategies_T.h:
	* ace/Strategies_T.cpp:

	  Reverted part of changes that introduced extensive use of
	  traits since they were forcing the introduction of the
	  ACE_TYPENAME macro in more places than is desirable at this
	  point in time.  They may be reintroduced in the future.

Thu Feb 20 09:24:00 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/Service_Config.h:

	  Forward declare ACE_Service_Object.  Necessitated by inter-header
	  dependency reductions.

Thu Feb 20 09:23:51 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* ace/Acceptor.h:
	* ace/Connector.h:

	  No need to include "ace/Service_Config.h" and
	  "ace/Svc_Handler.h".

	  Include "ace/Synch_Options.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
	  dependency reductions.

	* ace/Acceptor.cpp:
	* ace/Connector.cpp:

	  Include "ace/Svc_Handler.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
	  dependency reductions.

	* ace/Atomic_Op.h:

	  Fixed doxygen documentation.

	* ace/Atomic_Op.i (operator++, operator--):

	  Implement these post{in,de}crement operators in terms of their
	  corresponding pre{in,de}crement operators to ensure consistent
	  semantics.

	* ace/Atomic_Op_T.h (mutex_, own_mutex_):

	  Improved const-correctness by making these mutex members
	  mutable.  This allows us to avoid casting away the constness.

	* ace/Atomic_Op_T.i (operator==, operator>=, operator>):
	  (operator<=, operator<, value, operator=):

	  Do not cast away the constness of the mutex.  That hack is no
	  longer necessary since the mutex is now mutable.

	* ace/Basic_Types.h:

	  Improved doxygen documentation.

	  Moved endianness determination macros prior to ACE_U_LongLong
	  class.

	  (operator=):

	  Added ACE_ULongLong assignment operator declarations that accept
	  32 bit signed and unsigned integers.

	  (operator++, operator--):

	  Added missing ACE_ULongLong post{in,de}crement operator
	  declarations.

	  (data_):

	  Make declaration order of lower and upper 32 bit members (lo_
	  and hi_) of this structure dependant on the endianness of the
	  platform.  This mimics what is done for the ACE_LongLong type
	  in the ACE_CDR classes.

	* ace/Basic_Types.i (operator=):

	  Added ACE_ULongLong assignment operator implementation that
	  accept 32 bit signed and unsigned integers.

	  (operator++, operator--):

	  Added missing ACE_ULongLong post{in,de}crement operator
	  implementations.

	* ace/CDR_Base.cpp (mb_align):

	  Uninlined this method in order to reduce inter-header
	  dependencies.

	  (operator<, operator<=, operator>, operator>=, operator==):
	  (operator!=):

	  Added these missing operator for the ACE_LongLong type.

	  (Float, operator=, operator!=):

	  Fixed potential unused argument warnings for the Cray/UNICOS
	  case.

	* ace/CDR_Base.h:

	  Include "ace/OS.h" instead of "ace/Message_Block.h", and forward
	  declare ACE_Message_Block in order to reduce inter-header
	  dependencies.

	  Changed all uses of typedefs like "u_char" and "u_long" to their
	  non-typedef counterparts, e.g. "unsigned char" and "unsigned
	  long".  Makes it possible to avoid including headers that
	  contain those typedefs.

	  (operator=):

	  Added ACE_LongLong constructors assignment operators that accept
	  32-bit integers.

	  (operator==, operator!=, operator<=, operator<, operator>=):
	  (operator>):

	  Added these missing ACE_LongLong relation operators.

	* ace/CDR_Base.inl (operator=):

	  Added ACE_LongLong constructors assignment operators that accept
	  32-bit integers.

	  (operator==, operator!=, operator<=, operator<, operator>=):
	  (operator>):

	  Added these missing ACE_LongLong relation operators.

	* ace/CDR_Stream.h:

	  Moved definition of the ACE_CDR_BYTE_ORDER macros from OS.h to
	  this header.  Helps with header dependency reduction.

	* ace/Capabilities.h:

	  Use ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex instead of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager.
	  Doing so saves us three template instantiations.

	* ace/Capabilities.i:

	  Cosmetic changes.

	* ace/Capabilities.cpp:

	  No need to include "ace/Map_Manager.h".

	  Added missing ACE_RCSID macro.

	  Improved conformance to ACE coding conventions.

	  Removed explicit template instantiations for the
	  ACE_Hash_Map_Manager template.  That template is no longer
	  used.

	  (reset_caps):

	  Use ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex template traits instead of the
	  actual template type.  Makes for cleaner code.

	* ace/Configuration.cpp:
	* ace/Configuration.h:
	* ace/Strategies_T.cpp:
	* ace/Token_Collection.cpp:
	* ace/Token_Collection.h:
	* ace/Token_Invariants.cpp:
	* ace/Token_Invariants.h:
	* ace/Token_Manager.cpp:
	* ace/Token_Manager.h:
	* ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.cpp:
	* ace/WIN32_Asynch_IO.h:

	  Take advantage of template traits to improve clarity of code.

	* ace/Copy_Disabled.h:

	  Corrected comment.

	* ace/Default_Constants.h:

	  Moved ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_BUFSIZE, ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_EXP_GROWTH_MAX,
	  ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_LINEAR_GROWTH_CHUNK,
	  ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_MEMCPY_TRADEOFF macros from OS.h to this
	  header.  Helps with inter-header dependency reduction.

	* ace/Dynamic_Service_Base.cpp:
	* ace/Parse_Node.cpp:
	* ace/Service_Manager.cpp:
	* ace/Service_Repository.cpp:
	* ace/Svc_Conf.y:
	* ace/Svc_Conf_y.cpp:

	  Include "ace/Service_Types.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
	  dependency reduction.

	* ace/Filecache.h:
	* ace/Filecache.cpp:
	* ace/Hash_Map_With_Allocator_T.h:
	* ace/Hash_Map_With_Allocator_T.cpp:
	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.h:
	* ace/Local_Name_Space.cpp:

	  Use ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex instead of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager.
	  Doing so saves us three template instantiations.

	* ace/Future_Set.h:
	* ace/Map_T.h:

	  Include "ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.h" instead of
	  "ace/Hash_Map_Manager.h".  The former is all that is needed, and
	  the latter already includes the former.

	* ace/Hash_Map_Manager_T.i (operator++, operator--):
	* ace/Map_Manager.i:
	* ace/RB_Tree.i:

	  Implement the post-{in,de}crement operators in terms of their
	  pre-{in,de}crement operator counterparts to ensure consistency.

	* ace/Local_Name_Space_T.cpp:

	  No need to include "ace/Auto_Ptr.h"

	  Use template traits to improve code clarity.

	* ace/OS.h:

	  Moved ACE_CDR_BYTE_ORDER macro definition to CDR_Stream.h.
	  Helps with inter-header dependencies.

	  Moved ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_BUFSIZE, ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_EXP_GROWTH_MAX,
	  ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_LINEAR_GROWTH_CHUNK,
	  ACE_DEFAULT_CDR_MEMCPY_TRADEOFF to Default_Constants.h.  Helps
	  with inter-header dependency reduction.

	* ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.cpp:

	  Added missing ACE_RCSID macro.

	  (bytes_transferred):
	  Use map template traits to improve code clarity.
	
	* ace/POSIX_Asynch_IO.h:

	  Redefined old map typedefs in terms of the map traits.

	* ace/Parse_Node.h:
	* ace/Service_Repository.h:

	  No need to include "ace/Service_Types.h".  A forward declaration
	  for ACE_Service_Types is enough.

	* ace/Service_Config.h:

	  No need to include "ace/Service_Types.h" and "ace/Signal.h".
	  Forward declaring ACE_Service_Types and ACE_Sig_Adapter is
	  enough.

	* ace/Strategies_T.h:

	  No need to include "ace/Service_Config.h" and
	  "ace/Synch_Options.h".

	* ace/Synch_Options.h:

	  Changed all uses of typedefs like "u_char" and "u_long" to their
	  non-typedef counterparts, e.g. "unsigned char" and "unsigned
	  long".  Makes it possible to avoid including OS.h.  A big win in
	  compile time reduction.

	  Include "ace/Time_Value.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
	  dependency reduction.

	* ace/Synch_Options.cpp:

	  Changed all uses of typedefs like "u_char" and "u_long" to their
	  non-typedef counterparts, e.g. "unsigned char" and "unsigned
	  long".  Makes it possible to avoid including OS.h.  A big win in
	  compile time reduction.

	  Include "ace/Trace.h".  Necessitated by inter-header
	  dependency reduction.

	* ace/Template_Instantiations.cpp:

	  Removed all ACE_Hash_Map_Manager related template
	  instantiations.  The ones for ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex are all
	  that are needed.

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Acceptor.h (ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor):

	  Inherit privately from ACE_SSL_SOCK, instead of publically.
	  ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor is IMPLEMENTED-IN-TERMS-OF ACE_SSL_SOCK.
	  It does not satisfy the IS-A relationship.

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Connector.cpp (ssl_connect):

	  Use ACE_Countdown_Time to take into account the time between
	  each call to select() instead of using the same timeout value in
	  each loop iteration.

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.cpp (get_remote_addr):

	  Retrieve the remote addr from the parent ACE_SSL_SOCK class, not
	  ACE_SOCK.  Addresses potential inconsistencies in the future.

	* ace/SSL/SSL_SOCK_Stream.h (ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream):

	  Removed friend declarations for the
	  ACE_SSL_SOCK_{Acceptor,Connector} classes.  They are
	  unnecessary.

Wed Feb 19 12:50:58 2003  Heather Drury  <oci@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.3.1 released.

Mon Feb 17 15:21:18 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst: The Server_Protocol and the ORB_init
	  test in RTCORBA will not run in ST builds since the operations
	  ACE_OS::thr_getprio () are not supported.

Fri Feb 14 09:53:43 2003  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-osf1-4.0.h: Tru64 lacks the clearerr
          function when built without threads (thread=0).
          Thanks to Abhay Kulkarni <Abhay.Kulkarni@veritas.com> 
          for reporting the problem.

Thu Feb 13 17:50:07 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cse.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU: Build static libraries
          using xargs with the list of all the object files instead of
          using them directly on the command line. This works around
          brokenness of systems that have a small limit on the length of
          the command-line arguments. Thanks to Abhay Kulkarni
          <Abhay.Kulkarni@veritas.com> for reporting the problem.

Thu Feb 13 12:43:27 2003  Pradeep Gore  <pradeep@oomworks.com>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst:
	  Added TAO/examples/RTCORBA/Activity/run_test.pl to this list.

Thu Feb 13 07:36:40 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* THANKS: Added Dmitri Belogaj to the hall of fame.

Wed Feb 12 12:40:21 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Prevented a few RTCORBA tests to be run
	  in our daily builds since changing priorities requires root
	  access.

Wed Feb 12 12:06:05 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* ace/Strategies.h: Added this file for backward
	  compatibility. Backward compatibility was broken with the
	  following checkin

	  "Tue Nov 20 12:48:39 2001  Balachandran Natarajan
	  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>". Thanks to  Dmitri Belogaj
	  <belogaj@nentec.de> for reporting this problem.

Wed Feb 12 10:18:21 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/vc7.mpd: Checked in Chad's
	  missing ssl_libs fix.

Wed Feb 12 08:59:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/UPIPE_Addr.h:
          Removed ACE_UPIPE_Addr class which isn't used, typedef ACE_UPIPE_Addr
          still is there.

Tue Feb 11 22:19:39 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cse.wustl.edu>

        * examples/DLL/Makefile.Today (SHLIB):
        * examples/DLL/Makefile.Newsweek (SHLIB):

          Removed extra space at the end which caused compilation to
          break. Thanks to Bill Cassanova <BCassanova@weather.com> for
          reporting the problem.

Wed Feb 12 00:00:12 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* ace/OS.h:
	* ace/OS.i (thr_setprio): Add a new default thr_policy parameter which
	  allows us to explicitly set the policy in pthread_setschedparam().
	  Introduced to eliminate a bug discovered in RT-CORBA implementation.

Tue Feb 11 14:01:21 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* vc7_nightly.mwc: Added a temporary file specifying core nightly
	  build targets.  Notice this file includes both ACE and TAO.

	* ace/ace.mpc: Added XML_Svc_Conf.cpp.

	* ace/SSL/ssl.mpc: Fixed dllflags setting.

Mon Feb 10 18:08:12 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* THANKS: Added Otis Nyandoro to the hall of fame.

Mon Feb 10 18:02:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.h: Don't special-case SEH support on ACE_HAS_WINCE. First,
          CE can do SEH; second, the switching of this on/off can and should
          be done in the config file.

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: Enable ACE_HAS_WIN32_STRUCTURAL_EXCEPTIONS
          for WinCE.

          Thanks to Emmanuel Thevenot Beaufort
          <emmanuel.thevenot-beaufort@jci.com> for this fix.

        * ace/Handle_Set.{h i}: Remove the ACE_Handle_Set destructor for
          ACE_HAS_WINCE. The need for this predates the supported vc 3 and 4
          compilers, and having it in there triggers an SEH warning.

        * ace/SPIPE_Stream.i: Follow-up to:
          Mon Feb 10 09:22:04 2003  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>
          Added the need for ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2 to enable this code. The calls
          and structures used aren't available in Winsock1.

        * ace/config-wince.h: Disable Winsock2 for CE versions less than 4.0.

Mon Feb 10 12:14:35 2003  Jeffrey Graham <jgraham@titan.com>

	* bin/ace-install:

	  Fixed problem where all TAO executables were not installed.

	  Fixed installed file permission problem.  Files that should have
	  global access didn't have it.

	  Fixed problem where the script did not easily flatten the
	  install directory, requires the ACE_ARCH subdirectory trees be
	  built.

	  Fixed problem where all binaries were not filtered out.

Mon Feb 10 19:42:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/ATM_Acceptor.h:
          Converted old style documentation to doxygen style

        * ace/Arg_Shifter.h:
          Added private declaration of copy constructor and assignment
          operator. Instances of these class can not be copied using the
          default ones. Also fixes a MSVC6 level 4 warning.

        * ace/Configuration.cpp:
          Removed not needed MingW ifdef, the normal code also compiles with
          MingW

        * ace/config-win32.h:
          Removed cygwin from this file. For cygwin the config-cygwin32.h
          must be included directly in config.h

        * ace/Notification_Strategy.h:
        * ace/Notification_Strategy.inl:
          Made mask() method const

        * include/makeinclude/ace_flags.bor:
          If TAO_ROOT isn't defined, define it as $(ACE_ROOT)/TAO

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/bor.mpd:
        * include/makeinclude/build_dll.bor:
        * include/makeinclude/build_exe.bor:
          Thanks for Christopher Kohlhoff <chris@kohlhoff.com> for providing
          a fix for the singleton template with Borland. The problem is that
          with a singleton template the code is implicitly generated into
          every object file that references it. The linker then strips out
          all but a single copy of the code. When linking an exe that refers
          to a singleton template in a dll, the linker would choose one
          of the template code instances in the exe's .obj files, and
          completely ignore the instance that was exported by the dll.

          The key to the solution is that it appears that the borland linker
          chooses the first instance of the template symbols that it sees. The
          linker will let you list the .lib files in the place normally used
          for object files. By listing the library files before any of the
          object files, it resolves the template code against the dll exports.

        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/Makefile:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/Makefile.Timer:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/Misc/Makefile.main:
          Splitted the original GNU makefile in multiple files, one for the
          shared library and one for the exe and one to trigger the other
          two. This fixes the compile errors with this example with Cygwin
          and MingW. Thanks for Vince Mounts <vince@mounts.cc> for making
          these makefiles.

Mon Feb 10 09:22:04 2003  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * ace/SPIPE_Stream.i: Added a special case for win32 platforms to
          ACE_SPIPE_Stream::send_handle() and recv_handle() to allow handle
          passing. The extension is necessary since the receiving side must
          open the duplicate handle before the sending side closes it.

Fri Feb  7 17:22:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/OS.cpp (ACE_OS::thr_create): Moved the pthread_setstack() call
          (and the check for whether it's available) from inside the
          Pthreads draft 4/6 section to the Pthreads standard section
          and corrected the condition it's used (defined
          ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SETSTACK, not !defined ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SETSTACK).

          Also see:
          Thu Jan 16 19:06:19 2003  Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu>

Fri Feb  7 16:55:58 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Reverted change to aix config file:

          Fri Feb  7 15:27:40 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

Fri Feb  7 15:37:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_aix_ibm.GNU: Define DCCFLAGS with the
          debugging options for xlC_r; Change DCFLAGS to just -g (for the C
          compiler). Thanks to Trevor Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com> for
          reporting this problem.

Fri Feb  7 15:27:40 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-aix-4.x.h: Restored the defining of
          ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE for AIX VisualAge 5,
          which is needed for building TAO.  Thanks to Trevor
          Fields <fields_t@ociweb.com> for this fix.

Fri Feb  7 13:04:51 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/ace_wchar.h: Added a new macro, ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_WCHAR(STRING).
          It's the inverse of ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR - whatever STRING is,
          the macro produces a wide-char string. Thanks to
          Emmanuel Thevenot Beaufort <emmanuel.thevenot-beaufort@jci.com>
          for this macro.

Thu Feb  6 19:30:18 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * tests/SString_Test.cpp: Added a test for wide-string compares of
          equal-length strings that differ in the last character.

        * ace/String_Base.i (compare): When memcmp()-ing to compare, take
          the size of CHAR into account when calculating byte length. Thanks
          to Emmanuel Thevenot Beaufort <emmanuel.thevenot-beaufort@jci.com>
          for this fix.

Thu Feb  6 16:06:29 2003  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-tru64.h: Added a guard around the
          ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF as versions earlier than 5.0 do not seem
          have this function.

Thu Feb  6 15:03:04 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Make the removal of IDL
          generated files in realclean target dependent upon the
          definition of IDL_FILES. MingW make crashes on empty "rm -f "
          commands.

Thu Feb  6 15:19:28 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.h:
        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.i: Made the other get() method const. See
          previous ChangeLog entry.

Thu Feb  6 07:13:06 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.{h,i} (get): Made the get() method const.
          Thanks to Jenny Kowald <jkowald@agile.tv> for suggesting this.

Wed Feb  5 20:48:47 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cse.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Added rules to generate
          object files from C++ file extensions .cxx, .C and .cc, in
          addition to .cpp.

Wed Feb  5 20:15:18 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cse.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU: Removed the conditional
          setting of VSHOBJS and VSHOBJS1 based on PRELIB. There is too
          much bogosity here. This should fix HP-UX and AIX breakage.

Sat Feb  1 08:43:53 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Stream_Modules.cpp (put): Return 0 rather than -1 to be consistent
          wrt the put() semantics elsewhere in ACE.  Thanks to Jody Hagins
          <jody@atdesk.com> for help with this.

        * tests/FIFO_Test.cpp (server): Only compile this on platforms
          that aren't Win32 since FIFO's don't work there.  Thanks to Carl
          Halvorson <cyberdesk@yahoo.com> for reporting this.

Wed Feb  5 09:45:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
          Removed desciption to MINGW_BASE.

Tue Feb  4 13:13:08 2003  Krishnakumar B  <kitty@cs.wustl.edu>

        * include/makeinclude/rules.lib.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/rules.bin.GNU:

          Generalized the creation of objects from source files by
          removing the dependency that the source files be named *.cpp.
          Also removed a lot of junk.

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Removed some more
          accumulated cruft.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.nested.GNU: Fix recursive make so
          that users can name the makefiles in sub-directories as
          something other than Makefile by introducing a new variable
          SUBDIR_MAKEFILE.

        * ace/Makefile: Fix the Makefile to use the above extension when
          recursing into directories.

        * include/makeinclude/rules.local.GNU: Add a new local target
          clean_idl_stubs.local which cleans all the IDL generated files.
          This target is linked to realclean so the IDL generated files
          will only be cleaned with realclean.

          Thanks to James Mansion <james.mansion@uk.nomura.com> for
          reporting the bugs and suggesting some fixes.

Tue Feb  4 11:21:13 MST 2003 Rob Andzik <andzik@rtlogic.com>

         * ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU
            - Added three new variables
                         GCC_VERSION (defaults to gcc-2.96)
                         VXWORKS_VERSION_FLAG (defaults to -DACE_VXWORKS=0x542)
                         VXWORKS_STDINC_FLAG (defaults to <null>)

            - Modified all sets of GCCLIB_DIR to use GCC_VERSION
            - Modified all references to ACE_VXWORKS to use VXWORKS_VERSION_FLAG
            - replaced -nostdinc with VXWORKS_STDINC_FLAG

         * ACE_wrappers/ace/config-vxworks5.x.h
            - Added define ACE_LACKS_CLEARERR (wrapped in ACE_VXWORKS check)

         * ACE_wrappers/ace/OS.i
            - Added ACE_UNUSED_ARG where warnings occurred.

Mon Feb  3 16:33:02 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h: msgsnd() with const parameter was recently
          added to FreeBSD-CURRENT. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues' for this change.

Sat Feb  1 09:34:45 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst:

          Disable TAO's IORInterceptor test for the GIOP 1.0 build
          configuration.  The test requires IOR tagged components that are
          not supported in GIOP 1.0.  Fixes a false positive in our
          scoreboard.

Sat Feb  1 07:50 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * Our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the crew of
          the US Space Shuttle Columbia, which was lost over Texas this
          morning.

          "We shall never forget them nor the last time we saw them, as
          they prepared for their mission and waved good-bye and slipped
          the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God."

             - President Reagan (addressing NASA employees following the
               tragic loss of the Challenger 7 crew on STS-51L.)

          Ad astra per aspera.

Sat Feb  1 09:00:00 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Space Shuttle Columbia breaks up at 200,000ft altitude at
          12,500mph. 7 astronauts killed; the US and Israel mourn their loss.

Fri Jan 31 12:55:26 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * tests/Reactor_Exceptions_Test.cpp (worker):  Added #if defined
          (ACE_HAS_THREADS) guard around worker () function to remove a
          compiler warning on single threaded configurations that have
          exceptions enabled.

Thu Jan 30 21:57:58 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * examples/Threads/thread_specific.cpp (worker): Added __OpenBSD__
          to the list of OS/compilers that can check printf arguments.
          This removes a compilation warning.

Thu Jan 30 21:50:27 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h: Added ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED, since it turns
          out that sched_setscheduler hasn't been implemented on OpenBSD.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Disabled the MT_Cubit test for OpenBSD,
          since it fails completely when sched_params returns an error.

Thu Jan 30 10:34:02 2003  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

        From Olivier Brunet <o.brunet@free.fr>
        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp (report_error):

          Corrected format specifier for wide string case.

Wed Jan 29 12:31:51 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
        * ace/config-openbsd-pthreads.h: Merged config files together and
          removed config-openbsd-pthreads.h like what was done for
          FreeBSD.

        * include/makeinclude/platform_openbsd.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_openbsd_pthreads.GNU:  Merged files
          together and removed platform_openbsd_pthreads.GNU like
          FreeBSD.  Also removed gratuitous link of -lstdc++.  g++ already
          does that for us.  Thanks to Craig Rodrigues' changelog entry.

Wed Jan 29 11:47:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACEXML/tests/ContentHandler_Test.cpp: Fixed compile errors by
          adding/correcting use of the ACEXML exception macros.

Wed Jan 29 08:30:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Vector_T.cpp:
          Fixed bug in resize() method, of the original vector, the last
          item was lost during resize(). Thanks to Denis Parnaland
          <denis.parnaland@tde.alstom.com> for reporting this.

        * tests/Vector_Test.cpp:
          Extended this test to test the resize() method of ACE_Vector.

        * THANKS: Added Denis Parnaland.

Tue Jan 28 18:46:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.cpp (parse_element): When converting
          an escape sequence, add its length, don't lose the length of
          already-parsed content. Thanks to Emmanuel Thevenot Beaufort
          <emmanuel.thevenot-beaufort@jci.com> for this fix.

        * ACEXML/tests/ContentHandler_Test.{cpp dsp}: New test that
          illustrates the problem above and validates the fix.

        * ACEXML/tests/Tests.dsw:
        * ACEXML/Makefile:
        * ACEXML/Makefile.bor: Added ContentHandler_Test.

        * THANKS: Added Emmanuel Thevenot Beaufort to the Hall of Fame.

Tue Jan 28 15:47:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_aCC.GNU: For distrib builds,
          changed the +h option to not specify the whole path; put the path
          in the path search option (+b).

Mon Jan 27 14:28:16 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU: Remove unnecessary use
          of GNU make basename command.  Supplied by Ganesh Pai <gpai@sonusnet.com>.

Sun Jan 26 16:42:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU:
          When AIO support is found, set the right define but also add the
          library liblrt to the lists to link with. Only when building with
          threading support link with the pthread library.

Sun Jan 26 16:42:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_borland.GNU:
          Don't set any BUILD_DLL defines in this file, the BUILD_DLL defines
          are set in the specific makefiles.

Sat Jan 25 20:31:56 2003  Frank Hunleth  <frank@hunleth.com>

        * ace/config-openbsd.h:
        * ace/config-openbsd-pthread.h: Added ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF since
          OpenBSD has snprintf() and to fix buffer overflow tested for by
          tests/Log_Msg_Test.

Sat Jan 25 18:15:48 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added a new test to the daily builds.

Sat Jan 25 13:39:23 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Removed the usage of MINGW_BASE. This is not needed for using MingW.
          Thankx to Viktor Ransmayr <viktor.ransmayr@t-online.de> for
          confirming that this is not needed.

Fri Jan 24 07:54:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/OS.h:
          VxWorks 5.4 lacks some ANSI prototypes. These are defined by
          VxWorks 5.5 so we only define these ANSI prototypes when defined
          ACE_VXWORKS and this is equal or smaller 0x540. Else we just
          include apra/inet.h.

Thu Jan 23 17:57:05 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * ace/README: Deleted non-ascii characters around ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SETSTACK.

Thu Jan 23 17:44:38 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_freebsd.GNU: Remove gratuitous link
          of -lstdc++.  g++ already does that for us.

Wed Jan 22 21:08:48 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/WFMO_Reactor_Logging_Server.cpp (Quit_Handler):
          Sync with code in the book.

Wed Jan 22 18:12:41 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * examples/C++NPv2/Service_Reporter.cpp:
        * examples/C++NPv2/Configurable_Logging_Server.cpp: Change the
          name of the static service descriptor from Reporter to
          Reporter_Descriptor. This is more descriptive and matches
          the book.

Wed Jan 22 18:08:27 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h: Add ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF.  Fixes Log_Msg_Test.

Wed Jan 22 18:03:35 UTC 2003  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_icc.GNU:
        * include/makeinclude/platform_linux_kcc.GNU:
          Remove defines of _POSIX_THREADS and _POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS.
          These POSIX constants are not meant to be defined by
          the user.  The user must include <unistd.h> and *check*
          the value of these constants.  On Linux glibc systems,
          after including <unistd.h>, the header <bits/posix_opt.h>
          will be eventually be included...these constants are
          defined by the glibc implementation in that header.

Wed Jan 22 10:55:39 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-tru64.h: Added ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF. Thanks to Vladimir
          Chovanec <Vladimir.CHOVANEC@asset.sk> for this fix.

Wed Jan 22 01:24:51 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Message_Queue_T.h: Corrected the documentation for
          ACE_Message_Block_Ex so it says ACE_MESSAGE_TYPE rather than
          ACE_Message_Block.

Tue Jan 21 21:44:04 2003  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACEXML/examples/SAXPrint/broken.xml: Added a new broken XML file
          to make sure we handle this case properly.

        * ACEXML/parser/parser/Parser.i (get): Added a check for
          successful <get> operation from the input CharStream to avoid
          out of the infinite loop when reading broken XML files.  Thanks
          to Volodymyr Orlenko <vorlenko@jaalam.com> for reporting this
          and submitting the patch.

Mon Jan 20 20:32:55 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/Log_Msg.cpp (log): Added a '}' at line 1531 to fix a
          nasty compiler bug on Digital UNIX.  Thanks to Igor Pisarenko
          <Igor.Pisarenko@computershare.com.au> and
          Pit Linnartz <Pit.Linnartz@t-mobile.de> for reporting this.

Tue Jan 21 19:29:04 2003  Heather Drury  <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Disabled orbsvcs/Test/EC_MT_MCast on
          static builds.

Tue Jan 21 08:43:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_doxygen.pl: Fixed a cut and paste error.

Mon Jan 20 16:22:43 2003  Heather Drury <drury_h@ociweb.com>

        * ace/NT_Service.cpp: Modified return statement as the
          wait_for_service_state function is declared as void and it was
          returning an int.

Mon Jan 20 15:48:35 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added a TAO test to the daily builds.

Mon Jan 20 13:58:25 2003  Rich Seibel <seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * ace/config-macosx.h: Added ACE_HAS_SNPRINTF as well as
          ACE_LACKS_PERFECT_MULTICAST_FILTERING to make the ACE
          Mac OSX 10.2.x build pass the Log_Msg_Test and the
          Multicast_Test.  Thanks to John Michael Zorko <j.zorko@att.net>
          for providing this patch.

Mon Jan 20 18:59:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * examples/C++NPv2/Makefile.CLD:

        * examples/C++NPv2/Makefile.TPCLS:
        * examples/C++NPv2/Makefile.TPLS:
        * ace/RMCast/Makefile:
          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler. Thanks to Vince Mounts
          <vince@mounts.cc> for providing the patches.

Mon Jan 20 11:58:00 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_doxygen.pl: Fixed the spaces in the file names
          of generated man pages. Thanks to Olver Kellogg for providing
          this patch.

Sun Jan 19 11:40:10 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ace/NT_Service.{h,cpp}: Enhanced the wait_For_service_state() so
          that it actually uses the wait_time parameter.  Thanks to Theo
          Landman <tlandman@justcroft.com> for contributing this.

        * ace/Process_Manager.cpp (spawn): Cleanup dynamically allocated
          memory if the spawn() fails.  Thanks to Kobi Cohen-Arazi
          <kobi@mivzak.com> for this fix.

Sun Jan 19 15:03:13 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * websvcs/lib/Makefile:
          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Sat Jan 18 17:49:20 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * Makefile: Removed PACE references.

Sat Jan 18 17:11:21 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/make_release: Use doxygen 1.2.18 as opposed to doxygen
          1.2.13.1.

Fri Jan 17 09:00:17 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@macarena.cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html (make): Removed all claims that we support
          SunC++ 4.2.  Thanks to Kirat Singh <kirat.singh@gs.com> for
          reporting this.

Sat Jan 18 09:07:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * tests/Makefile.DLL_Test:
        * tests/Makefile.Framework_Component_DLL:
        * tests/Makefile.Service_Config_DLL:
        * examples/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/Makefile:
          Set the correct x_BUILD_DLL defines. These are needed for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Fri Jan 17 12:34:51 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ACE-INSTALL.html: Updated platform and compiler information.

Thu Jan 16 19:06:19 2003  Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS.cpp:
        * ace/config-linux-common.h:
        * ace/config-freebsd.h:
        * ace/README:

          Added a new macro called ACE_HAS_PTHREAD_SETSTACK for systems
          that use the newer glibc (2.3+). Eliminates linker warning about
          not using the pthread function called pthread_setstack.

Thu Jan 16 16:25:45 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.lst: Added a TAO/orbsvcs/tests/EC_MT_Mcast
          test to the daily builds.

Thu Jan 16 12:27:24 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * COPYING: Extended the validity of the copyright notice from 2002
          to 2003. Should have been done yesterday, anyway, better late
          than never.

Wed Jan 15 18:02:01 2003  Bala  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

        * ACE version 5.3 released.

Wed Jan 15 10:48:11 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/make_release: Did the following enhancements

          - If it is a minor release do not append the beta version. Looks
            like somone broke this and the script started writing out
            things as x.3.0, whcih is bad BTW.

          - We now POSIX.1 tar, instead of old tar format with the -H
            option in cpio. This helps to tar files deep in the hierarchy
            tree to be properly zipped. We were loosing this in many
            betas.

          - Fixes for the generated filenames copied into the
            previous_versions directory.

          - Fix to get the right Version.h file in TAO.


Tue Jan 14 18:51:49 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Auto_Ptr.h: Added pragma to disable warning 4284 for Microsoft
          compilers. The warned-of behavior is exactly what is intended.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcpdll.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcpdllexe.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcplib.mpt:
        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/em3vcplibexe.mpt:
          Added a "WCE emulator" configuration section. This allows builds
          for the WinCE emulator, necessary for working with the WinCE.NET
          Standard SDK emulator.

Tue Jan 14 14:56:12 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h: For WinCE, don't include wce.h unless
          building with MFC. wce.h is an MFC file.

        * ace/config-WinCE.h: Add pragmas to link _with_ corelibc.lib and
          _without_ oldnames.lib. These weren't needed with WinCE 3/PocketPC
          (but they don't hurt) and are needed for WinCE .NET. The ATL headers
          do these pragmas, but we don't want to add a dependency on ATL.

Tue Jan 14 11:07:06 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_export_file.pl: Added a patch from
          Gonzalo Diethelm <gonzalo.diethelm@aditiva.com> which generates
          an empty CVS Id string.

Mon Jan 13 12:53:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/config-win32-common.h:
          The MingW compiler can handle the export/import macros.

        * ace/config-cygwin32.h:
          Corrected the guards around this header file.

Sat Jan 11 09:37:24 2003  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@tango.doc.wustl.edu>

        * ace/OS_String.cpp (wcslen_emulation): Fixed a nasty formatting
          glitch that made the code hard to read.  Thanks to Ruslan
          Zasukhin <sunshine@public.kherson.ua> for reporting this.

Fri Jan  3 21:46:00 2003  John Michael Zorko  <j.zorko@att.net>

        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Client/Makefile: Added $(ACELIB) to
          ACE_SHLIBS to fix multple -lACE problem.  This wasn't an
          issue on Mac OS X 10.2, but could be on other platforms.

        * examples/ASX/CCM_App/Makefile: same as above
        * netsvcs/clients/Naming/Dump_Restore/Makefile: same as above

Wed Jan  8 19:27:49 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/Message_Block.h: Doxygenized comments for release() and copy().

        * ace/UPIPE_Stream.{h cpp}: Removed the remaining_ member; use the
          ACE_Message_BLock::length() member function to find the amount
          of remaining data.

Wed Jan  8 12:17:10 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/ace-install: Fixed the improper usage of "or" in the "find "
          command used to find the inlined files with extensions .i and
          .inl. Thanks to Oliver Kellog for providing the patch.

Tue Jan  7 13:08:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ACEXML/common/Makefile:
          Set ACEXML_BUILD_DLL when building the shared lib.

Mon Jan  6 18:31:09 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/generate_topinfo_charts.sh: Removed the range for the
          Y-AXIS, for the graphs to auto-adjust while plotting.

Mon Jan  6 16:56:04 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/topinfo_iorsize_stats.sh: Scripts for capturing the size of
          the server and client when shipping large IOR's

        * bin/topinfo_stats.sh: Renamed to topinfo_simple_stats.sh. This
          is a better to show that we capture the sizes of a simple server
          and client.

        * bin/topinfo_simple_stats.sh: New file. We need to do some code
          sharing between these two scripts. Just postponing that for the
          timebeing.

Mon Jan  6 11:23:12 UTC 2003  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_gnuwin32_common.GNU:
          Removed setting ACE_OS_HAS_DLL to 1, this should be done more
          specific in the makefiles

Sat Jan  4 18:46:19 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/config-aix5.1.h: Add a #define ACE_AIX_VERS 501 if ACE_AIX_VERS
          isn't already defined. Helps to build with Visual Age C++ incremental
          mode. Support for incremental mode is going away after ACE 5.3, but
          this crutch can be used for now.

        * ace/Makefile.ace: Remove SOCK_Dgram_Mcast_T from TEMPLATE_FILES. See
          Tue Jun 25 23:22:09 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

        * ace/ace.icc: Corrected the list of source files to build ACE with.
          In addition to updating the source list, if building with Visual
          Age C++ 5, add the TEMPLATE_FILES to the sources that get compiled.
          Visual Age C++ 5 incremental needs to see them all.

        * examples/C++NPv1/Makefile: Add .NOTPARALLEL since some of the
          sub-makes share object files and they can get confused.

        * tests/makeicc.pl: Add additional template-getting stuff for
          Visual Age C++ 5.

          don't build. They require explicitly including the needed template
          source files names in the .icc file. I don't have time to add them
          all now - if anyone uses this compiler, please contact me. No wonder
          IBM ditched this piece of junk.

Fri Jan  3 17:58:21 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * ace/SSL/SSL_Context.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Name_Handler.cpp:
        * netsvcs/lib/Server_Logging_Handler.cpp: Add __hpux to condition
          where template members are explicitly instantiated. Also see:
          Tue Dec  3 20:47:39 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

Fri Jan  3 17:45:29 2003  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_hpux_gcc.GNU: Use HP's /usr/bin/ar
          instead of GNU ar (which may be picked up first in PATH). GNU ar
          crashes - missing libfl.sl.

        * performance-tests/Misc/test_singleton.cpp: Add __hpux to conditions
          for explicitly instantiating ACE_Singleton::singleton_.

Fri Jan  3 07:49:09 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * bin/aix_shr:

          Changed the name of the AIX template instantiation macro and
          commented on why it's needed.

Thu Jan  2 17:44:29 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-cygwin32-common.h: Set the custom export
          macro's. These will be used when building dynamically with the
          cygwin compiler.

        * bin/MakeProjectCreator/templates/gnu.mpd: Generate dllflags and
          libflags into the GNU makefiles. These are important for the
          Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

Thu Jan  2 16:11:38 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * ace/config-freebsd.h: Fix use of macros for FreeBSD 4.6:
          ACE_LACKS_RWLOCK_T, ACE_LACKS_READDIR_R, ACE_LACKS_SETSCHED,
          ACE_LACKS_PTHREAD_THR_SIGSETMASK. Do not define SCHED_RR,
          SCHED_IO, SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_OTHER for FreeBSD >= 4.0, since they
          are defined in sched.h. Thanks to Craig Rodrigues for providng
          the patch.

Thu Jan  2 13:33:01 2003  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * ace/Refcounted_Auto_Ptr.i:

          Added #include of ace/Log_Msg.h for ACE_ASSERT.

        * bin/aix_shr:

          Added -DTAO_INSTANTIATING_TEMPLATES to the link command line.

Thu Jan  2 12:38:55 2003  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * ace/Makefile.ace: Set the dllflags in Makefile. This makes it
          possible to do __declspec (dllexport) for the symbols in the
          dll. This is needed for the Cygwin/MingW and Kylix compiler.

          Thid change takes care of the static and dynamic library cases.

Thu Jan  2 08:57:26 2003  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * include/makeinclude/platform_cygwin32.GNU:  Add
          --enable-auto-import to the linker flags. This will result in
          the linker doing auto-import without giving warnings about
          it.

Wed Jan  1 14:26:09 2003  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * bin/topinfo_stats.sh: Forgot that we run this scripts in cron
          environment. Set the path and other details that would help to
          ease things.
