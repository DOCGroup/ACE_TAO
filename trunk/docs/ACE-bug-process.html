<H3>ACE+TAO Bug Fixing Policies</H3>

As <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</A> have grown in
popularity the volume of mail on the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE+TAO users
mailing list</A> and USENET newsgroup <A
HREF="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">comp.soft-sys.ace</A> has grown
considerably.  While this increase is healthy, and a natural
consequence of the larger number of ACE and TAO users, it is straining
the resources of the DOC <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-members.html">research
group</A> at <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-center.html">Washington
University</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-lab.html">UC Irvine</A> to
respond to all the traffic immediately.  Moreover, our prompt bug
fixes may actually be discouraging the creation of a larger community
of users who have deep knowledge of how ACE and TAO work and can help
provide bug fixes and new features. <P>

Therefore, in order for us to continue supporting ACE and TAO
effectively and to allow the ACE and TAO user community to evolve, we
abide by the following policies:

<UL>

<LI> All bug reports that are submitted using the appropriate bug
report form in <A
HREF="../PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM">$ACE_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM</A>
or <A
HREF="../TAO/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM">$TAO_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM</A>
will be given a tracking number and entered into our <A
HREF="http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla">bug tracking database</A>.
Please use these forms since bug reports that are not submitted in
this form are likely to fall through the cracks.  Here is our policy
for addressing these bug reports: <P>

<OL>

<LI> If a report or question is from someone <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-sponsors.html">sponsoring</A>
our work we will respond to it in a timely manner.  Please contact <A
HREF="mailto:schmidt@cs.wustl.edu">me</A> if you'd like to become a
sponsor. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report along with a fix we will also apply this
in a timely manner. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report that will prevent ACE or TAO from working on
a major platform used by our sponsors we'll try to fix it as time
permits. <P>

</OL>

<LI> If it's a bug report that doesn't fall into the preceding three
categories, the submitter should enter it into our <A
HREF="http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla">bug tracking database</A> for
future processing.  We will address these bugs as time permits, but
may not get to it for a while unless it affects our work or the work
of our sponsors.  If you'd like an immediate response, please contact
<A HREF="mailto:schmidt@cs.wustl.edu">me</A> about becoming a sponsor
or contact <A HREF="http://www.riverace.com">Riverace</a> or <A
HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com">OCI</A> for commercial support of ACE
or TAO, respectively. <P>

We encourage bug reports for those without support to be posted
initially to the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE users</A>
(<A HREF="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ace-users@cs.wustl.edu</A>)
or <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-mail.html">TAO
users</A> (<A
HREF="mailto:tao-users@cs.wustl.edu">tao-users@cs.wustl.edu</A>)
mailing lists, where the ACE+TAO user community may already have
developed, or have an interest in developing, a solution.  While the
core ACE+TAO development team will continue to participate in this
mailing list we can not guarantee immediate response to all
postings. <P>

<LI> If you find a problem with a version of TAO that was released by
    <A HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com/">OCI</A> then please report it
    to <A
    HREF="mailto:taosupport@ociweb.com">taosupport@ociweb.com</A> since
    their version of TAO is somewhat different from the DOC group's
    version of TAO and thus they provide their own support. <P>

<LI> If it's a general question about how to use ACE or TAO feature
we'll try to respond as time permits, though we will also rely on the
experience of the ACE and TAO user community to field these types of
questions, as well.  If you have a question about TAO, you should
first check out the TAO <A
HREf="http://www.theaceorb/faq">online FAQ</A> to see if your
question has already been answered.  If you require consulting support
for ACE and/or TAO, please contact <A
HREF="http://www.riverace.com">Riverace</a> or <A
HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com">OCI</A>, as well. <P>

</UL>

Naturally, we encourage other ACE+TAO users to continue to help
provide fixes and advice in response to postings on the ACE and TAO
mailing list. <P>
