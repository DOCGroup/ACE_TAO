<H3>ACE+TAO Bug Fixing Process</H3>

As <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</A> have grown in
popularity the volume of mail on the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE users
mailing list</A> and USENET newsgroup <A
HREF="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">comp.soft-sys.ace</A> has grown
considerably.  While this increase is healthy, and a natural
consequence of the larger number of ACE and TAO users, it is straining
the resources of the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-center.html">DOC Center</A>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-members.html">research
group</A> at <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/">Washington
University</A> to respond to all the traffic immediately.  Moreover,
our prompt bug fixes may actually be discouraging the creation of a
larger community of users who have deep knowledge of how ACE and TAO
work and can help provide bug fixes and new features. <P>

Therefore, in order for us to continue supporting ACE and TAO
effectively and to allow the ACE and TAO user community to evolve, we
are instituting the following policies:

<UL>

<LI> All bug reports that are submitted using the appropriate bug
report form in <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/BUG-REPORT-FORM">$ACE_ROOT/BUG-REPORT-FORM</A>
or <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/BUG-REPORT-FORM">$TAO_ROOT/BUG-REPORT-FORM</A>
will be given a tracking number and entered into a database (which
will soon be available for public viewing on the Web, like the rest of
our documentation and source).  Please use these forms since bug
reports that are not submitted in this form are likely to fall through
the cracks.  <P>

<LI> If a report or question is from someone <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-sponsors.html">sponsoring</A>
our work we will respond to it in a timely manner.  Please contact <A
HREF="mailto:schmidt@cs.wustl.edu">me</A> if you'd like to become a
sponsor. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report along with a fix we will also apply this
in a timely manner. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report that will prevent ACE or TAO from working on
a major platform used by our sponsors we will fix it in a timely
manner, as well. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report that doesn't fall into the preceding
category we will treat it like all other bug reports and assign it a
tracking number and enter this into our bug report database for future
processing.  We will try to address this bug as time permits.  If
you'd like an immediate response, please contact <A
HREF="mailto:schmidt@cs.wustl.edu">me</A> about becoming a sponsor or
contact <A HREF="http://www.riverace.com">Riverace</a> or <A
HREF="http://www.ociweb.com">OCI</A> for commercial support of ACE or
TAO, respectively. <P>

We encourage bug reports for those without support to be posted
initially to the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE users</A>
mailing list at <A
HREF="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ace-users@cs.wustl.edu</A> where
the ACE+TAO user community may already have developed, or have an
interest in developing, a solution.  While the core ACE+TAO
development team will continue to participate in this mailing list we
can not guarantee immediate response to all postings. <P>

<LI> If it's a general question about how to use ACE or TAO feature
we'll try to respond as time permits, though we will also rely on the
experience of the ACE and TAO user community to field these types of
questions, as well.  If you require consulting support for ACE and/or
TAO, please contact <A HREF="http://www.riverace.com">Riverace</a> or
<A HREF="http://www.ociweb.com">OCI</A>, as well. <P>

</UL>

Naturally, we encourage other ACE+TAO users to continue to help
provide fixes and advice in response to postings on the ACE and TAO
mailing list. <P>
