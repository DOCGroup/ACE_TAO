<H3>ACE+TAO Bug Fixing Policies</H3>

As <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</A> have grown in
popularity the volume of mail on the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE+TAO users
mailing list</A> and USENET newsgroup <A
HREF="news:comp.soft-sys.ace">comp.soft-sys.ace</A> has grown
considerably.  While this increase is healthy, and a natural
consequence of the larger number of ACE and TAO users, it is straining
the resources of the DOC <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-members.html">research
group</A> at <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-center.html">Washington
University</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-lab.html">UC Irvine</A> to
respond to all the traffic immediately.  Moreover, our prompt bug
fixes may actually be discouraging the creation of a larger community
of users who have deep knowledge of how ACE and TAO work and can help
provide bug fixes and new features. <P>

For us to continue supporting ACE and TAO effectively and to allow the
ACE and TAO user community to evolve, please make it a point to abide
by the following policies:

<UL>

<LI> All bug reports to the ACE+TAO <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">mailing
lists</A> should be submitted using the appropriate bug report form in
<A HREF="../PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM">$ACE_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM</A>
(for ACE) or <A
HREF="../TAO/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM">$TAO_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM</A>
(for TAO).  Please use these forms since bug reports that are not
submitted in this form are likely to fall through the cracks.  Here is
our policy for addressing these bug reports: <P>

<OL>

<LI> If a report is from someone <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-sponsors.html">sponsoring</A>
our work we will respond to it in a very timely manner.  Please
contact <A HREF="mailto:schmidt@cs.wustl.edu">me</A> if you'd like to
become a sponsor. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report along with a fix we will also apply this
in a timely manner. In general, people who submit good bug
    reports with fixes tend to get much better help from the core DOC
    group team, irrespective of whether they are sponsors or not since
    they are helping our overall effort move ahead. <P>

<LI> If it's a bug report that will prevent ACE or TAO from working on
a major platform used by our sponsors we'll try to fix it as time
permits. <P>

</OL>

<LI> You should also consider entering your bug report into our <A
HREF="http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/bugzilla">bug tracking database</A>
so that it's archived for future processing.  We try to address these
bugs as time permits, but may not get to them for a while unless it
affects our work or the work of our sponsors.  If you'd like an
immediate response, please contact <A
HREF="mailto:schmidt@cs.wustl.edu">me</A> about becoming a sponsor or
contact one of the companies that provides <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/commercial-support.html">
commercial support</A> for ACE+TAO. <P>

We encourage bug reports for those without support to be posted
initially to the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html">ACE users</A>
(<A HREF="mailto:ace-users@cs.wustl.edu">ace-users@cs.wustl.edu</A>)
or <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-mail.html">TAO
users</A> (<A
HREF="mailto:tao-users@cs.wustl.edu">tao-users@cs.wustl.edu</A>)
mailing lists, where the ACE+TAO user community may already have
developed, or have an interest in developing, a solution.  While the
core ACE+TAO development team participates in this mailing list, we
can not guarantee responses to all postings. <P>

<LI> If you post something and don't get a reply, please do
    the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>
 Check to see whether your posting made it to the list, which you
  can see by checking out the <A
    HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.soft-sys.ace&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en">comp.soft-sys.ace</A> newsgroup to see if your posting is visible. <P>

<LI> If it's not visible, please make sure you're <A HREF="ACE-mail.html">subscribed to the mailing
  list(s)</A> you sent the report to since we have a "members only" posting
  requirement to minimize spam. <P>

<LI> If it is visible and you haven't received a reply this probably means
  that either no one knows the answer or no one has time to answer it.
  As always, if you need more predictable help please contact one of 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/commercial-support.html">commercial support</a> companies for ACE+TAO.<P>  

</UL>

<LI> If you find a problem with a version of TAO that was released by
    <A HREF="http://www.theaceorb.com/">OCI</A> then please report it
    to <A
    HREF="mailto:taosupport@ociweb.com">taosupport@ociweb.com</A> since
    their version of TAO is somewhat different from the DOC group's
    version of TAO and thus they provide their own support. <P>

<LI> If it's a general question about how to use ACE or TAO feature
we'll try to respond as time permits, though we will also rely on the
experience of the ACE and TAO user community to field these types of
questions, as well.  If you have a question about TAO, you should
first check out the TAO <A HREf="http://www.theaceorb.com/faq/">online
FAQ</A> to see if your question has already been answered.  If you
require consulting support for ACE and/or TAO, please contact one of
the companies that provides <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/commercial-support.html">commercial support</A> for ACE+TAO.<P>

</UL>

Naturally, we encourage other ACE+TAO users to continue to help
provide fixes and advice in response to postings on the ACE and TAO
mailing list.  But please be sensitive to the fact that the core team
is <EM>very</EM> busy so we simply don't have time to address problems
reported by non-sponsors. <P>
