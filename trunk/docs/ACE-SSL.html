<H3>What is ACE+SSL?</H3>
<p>ACE plus SSL is an addition to the core classes which allow the use of the Secure Socket Layer
with the ACE framework. The following are the core classes conditionally compiled in when you run
<code>make ssl=1</code>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ACE_SSL contains the interface to the ssl library OpenSSL.
	<li>ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream uses an interface and behavior nearly identical to
		ACE_SOCK_Stream, only with the additional ssl layer functionality.
	<li>ACE_SSL_SOCK_Acceptor/Connector are again similar to their ACE_SOCK counterparts
</ul>

<p>The ssl library we use is OpenSSL which is available at
<A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">www.openssl.org</A>. This library must be
installed in order to use ACE+SSL. We cannot answer all of the questions you may have about
OpenSSL, but hopefully through using the ACE+SSL interface your questions will be reduced.</p>

<H3>What is the status of ACE+SSL</H3>
<p>ACE+SSL is currently still in early development. If forced to name names, I would call the core
functionality beta, while the interface and niceties are still in an alpha stage of development.</p>

<H3>How do I get ACE+SSL?</H3>
<p>Due to the relaxation of export restrictions we have gained permission to distribute ACE+SSL along with the normal ACE distribution. It can be found in $ACE_ROOT/ace/SSL/. Also in the works is SSLIOP for TAO, which can be found in $ACE_ROOT/TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/SSLIOP/.
