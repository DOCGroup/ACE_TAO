    <h1>DOC Center Bug Tracking System Usage</h1>

<p>
The
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/doc-center.html">
Center for Distributed Object Computing</a> uses the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org//bugs/source.html">Bugzilla</a> bug
tracking system to keep track of existing problems and enhancement
requests.  Use it to enter problem reports or make a request for
particular feature that you'd like to see integrated into
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a> or
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</a>.

<p>
You can also use it to track the status of a particular bug or
enhancement.  In addition, the bug tracking system can be used to add
comments and attachment that contain solutions or simple test cases.

<p>
The bug tracking system is located at the following web site:
<a href="http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugzilla/">
	<samp>http://ace.cs.wustl.edu/bugzilla/</samp>
</a>

<p>
If all you want to do is browse through the bugs in our bug tracking
system or view bug summary reports, then you can use the bug tracking
system right away.  However, if you want to be able to submit bug
reports then you will have to create a bug tracking system account.

<p>
Upon entering a bug or enhancement request for the first time, you
will be asked to enter an e-mail address.  Once you've done that, you
will be mailed a password that you can use to log on to the bug
tracking system.  You will only be asked to do this once.  Any changes
to bug reports you submit will be mailed to the e-mail address you
provide.

Once you've logged on, you will have the ability to enter bug
reports and modify existing ones.  Other than adding comments, fixes
and attachments, please do not modify bug reports you haven't
submitted.

For more information about using Bugzilla, and about bug reporting in
general,  please see the following web sites:

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/bugs">
      <samp>http://www.mozilla.org/bugs</samp>
</a>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html">
      <samp>http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html</samp>
</a>

Keep in mind that the Bugzilla installation at the above web site is
<em>not</em> the same Bugzilla installation at Center for Distributed
Object Computing.  All bug reports and enhancement requests should be
done at the Center for Distributed Object Computing's Bugzilla web site.
