<P>Ok, so we've got a main() loop that sets up the acceptor and we've seen
how easy it is to create the acceptor object.&nbsp; So far, we've hardly
written any code at all.&nbsp; Well, that's just about to change...

<P>First, we look at <I><A HREF="client_handler.h">client_handler.h</A></I>
for the declaration of the Client_Handler object.&nbsp; Then we look at
the definition where all of the real work of the application takes place.

/*
   Our client handler must exist somewhere in the ACE_Event_Handler object
   hierarchy.  This is a requirement of the ACE_Reactor because it maintains
   ACE_Event_Handler pointers for each registered event handler.  You could
   derive our Client_Handler directly from ACE_Event_Handler but you still have
   to have an ACE_SOCK_Stream for the actual connection.  With a direct
   derivative of ACE_Event_Handler, you'll have to contain and maintain an
   ACE_SOCK_Stream instance yourself.  With ACE_Svc_Handler (which is a
   derivative of ACE_Event_Handler) some of those details are handled for you.

   about.  That's beyond our scope here but we'll come back to it in the next
   tutorial when we start looking at concurrency options.

     The destroy() method is our preferred method of destruction.  We could
     have overloaded the delete operator but that is neither easy nor
     intuitive (at least to me).  Instead, we provide a new method of

     our derivatives and our friends can delete us. It's a nice

     Most ACE objects have an open() method.  That's how you make them ready

     to create this overrride.  ACE_Acceptor<> will invoke this method after
     creating a new Client_Handler when a client connects. Notice that the
     parameter to open() is a void*.  It just so happens that the pointer
     points to the acceptor which created us.  You would like for the parameter
     to be an ACE_Acceptor<>* but since ACE_Event_Handler is generic, that
     would tie it too closely to the ACE_Acceptor<> set of objects.  In our
     definition of open() you'll see how we get around that.

     When there is activity on a registered handler, the handle_input() method
     of the handler will be invoked.  If that method returns an error code (eg
     -- -1) then the reactor will invoke handle_close() to allow the object to
     clean itself up. Since an event handler can be registered for more than
     one type of callback, the callback mask is provided to inform
     handle_close() exactly which method failed.  That way, you don't have to
     maintain state information between your handle_* method calls. The _handle
     parameter is explained below...
     As a side-effect, the reactor will also invoke remove_handler()
     for the object on the mask that caused the -1 return.  This means 
     that we don't have to do that ourselves!

     activity for us, our handle_input() will be invoked. The _handleg
     provided is the handle (file descriptor in Unix) of the actual connection
     causing the activity.  Since we're derived from ACE_Svc_Handler<> and it
     maintains it's own peer (ACE_SOCK_Stream) object, this is redundant for
     us.  However, if we had been derived directly from ACE_Event_Handler, we
     may have chosen not to contain the peer.  In that case, the _handleg
     would be important to us for reading the client's data.
