<P>Ok, so we've got a main() loop that sets up the acceptor and we've seen
how easy it is to create the acceptor object.&nbsp; So far, we've hardly
written any code at all.&nbsp; Well, that's just about to change...

<P>First, we look at <I><A HREF="client_handler.h">client_handler.h</A></I>
for the declaration of the Client_Handler object.&nbsp; Then we look at
the definition where all of the real work of the application takes place.

   object hierarchy.  This is a requirement of the ACE_Reactor because
   it maintains ACE_Event_Handler pointers for each registered event
   handler.  You could derive our Client_Handler directly from
   ACE_Event_Handler but you still have to have an ACE_SOCK_Stream for
   the actual connection.  With a direct derivative of
   ACE_Event_Handler, you'll have to contain and maintain an
   ACE_SOCK_Stream instance yourself.  With ACE_Svc_Handler (which is
   a derivative of ACE_Event_Handler) some of those details are

    this method after creating a new Client_Handler when a client
    connects. Notice that the parameter to open() is a void*.  It just
    so happens that the pointer points to the acceptor which created
    us.  You would like for the parameter to be an ACE_Acceptor&lt;>* but

    up. Since an event handler can be registered for more than one
    type of callback, the callback mask is provided to inform
    handle_close() exactly which method failed.  That way, you don't
    have to maintain state information between your handle_* method
    calls. The &lt;handle> parameter is explained below...  As a
