Creating a MultiThreaded Server </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>Our next step in building the multi-theaded server is to define the
classes which will carry out the processing after a connection has been
accepted by the acceptor. Given that the overall purpose of this tutorial
was to have a thread and reactor for each connection, we could also implement
multiple connections per reactor. Althought this is not necessary in this
example, it is beneficial to examine how this could be done for future
tutorials that will build on the concept. To do this we need some mechanism
for tracking the number of connections that are associated with a particular
reactor. We can achieve this by deriving a class from base class <I>ACE_Reactor</I>
and holding a private variable associated with the derived <I>Logging_Handler
</I>object. This will be incremented and decremented as client connections
are added and deleted respectively. Yeah, I know this mechanism is crude
..... but show me another way of doing it !! The dervied class definition
is as follows : </P>

<UL>
<PRE>1. class Reactor_Derived : public ACE_Reactor

        {       

        

        public :

2.             Reactor_Derived() : ()

                {

3.                     counter = 0;

                }

                

4.             virtual ~Reactor_Derived()

                {



                }

        

        private :

5.             friend class Logging_Handler;

                

                // counter is used to keep track of the number of service handlers

                // registered with this reactor

6.             int counter;

        };

<P>Here's the step-by-step explanation:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Declaration for the subclassed-reactor which is derived from the ACE_Reactor
base class. In our <I>Logging_Handler</I> object we will declare an object of this type instead of declaring an object of type <I>ACE_Reactor</I>.</LI>

<LI>Constructor for our subclassed-reactor. Notice the empty parentheses
- This calls the parent class constructor.</LI>

<LI>Set our connection counter variable to 0.</LI>

<LI>Our default constructor does nothing. We've moved anything with failure
potential into the <I>open</I> function. Should the constructor be virtual?</LI>

<LI>Declare the Logging_Handler class to be a friend class of this object.
This allows the Logging_Handler class to access our private connection
counter variable , allowing it to detect when all of our connections have
been terminated for this reactor object.</LI>

<LI>Our private counter variable which is used to count the number of connections
registered with this reactor. </LI>

<P>Now that the special reactor has been defined, we will define the final
class in our multi-threaded server, the Logging_Handler.</P>
