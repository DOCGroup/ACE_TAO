<HR WIDTH="100%">

<p><b>ACE_Stream</b> is handy when you have several <b>ACE_Task</b> objects
that you would like to link together.

<p>An intermediate class you we will deal with is the <b>ACE_Module</b>.

<p>The basic plan is to wrap your <b>Task</b> into a <b>Module</b>, push
the <b>Module</b> onto the <b>Stream</b>.  Do this for each <b>Task</b>,
 and then inject <b>Message_Block</b>s into the <b>Stream</b>.

<p>Each <b>Task</b> then processes the <b>Message_Block</b>, and forwards
it on to the next <b>Task</b> in the <b>Stream</b>.

<p>If you are not already familiar with <b>Message_Block</b>s and <b>Message_Queue</b>s,
I highly suggest that you check out <A HREF="../#MQ">Tutorials 10-13</A>.

<p>Streams can be used for both downstream and upstream movement of messages.  Used
this way mirrors closely the way System V STREAMS work.  But you don't have to use them
bidirectionally.  In this tutorial, we only use one direction of the Stream.  Down.

Kirthika's abstract:
<ul>
In this tutorial, an ACE_Stream has been implemented which has modules
flowing through it.(literally ;).
The chain of modules in the Stream include the Head and Tail Modules. A
Module is simply a reader-writer pair of ACE_Tasks with the writing side
acting as downstream and the reading side as upstream. Here we are only
concerned with going downstream so we install a Task into the write-side
of the module.
<P>
The task implementation makes use of flags to decide on whether to close
the main task or the service thread. The svc () method follows the
golden rule of copying message blocks before putting them on the queue
until it comes across a hang-up message. It then puts the message back
on the queue for its peers to obtain it and exits.
<P>
Any message put onto the Tail module is an error. So a customised
derivative of the Task class is created, which collects all the garbage
messages put onto the Tail. This End_Task is put into the Stream at the
start itself such that no modules whould ever follow it!
<P>
Then the other modules are pushed from the Tail-end into the Stream.
This is because we are interested in writing and not reading.
(Picture this to be a FIFO (queue) with head and tail nodes such
that the nodes are removed from the front and put into the queue from
the back)
<P>
Each module then opens up the task which spawns threads and begins to
shove messgaes down the stream. Once we have got all the messages into
the stream, our job is completed and we shut down the Stream.
<P>
A simple way to wade down the stream...;)
