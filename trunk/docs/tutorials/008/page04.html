<HR WIDTH="100%">

In <A HREF="broadcast_client.cpp">broadcast_client.cpp</A> we
find out how to send a single datagram to every host on our (sub)network.&nbsp;
I have to say <I>(sub)network</I> because broadcast datagrams typically
are not passed through routers.&nbsp; So, if your network admin has divided
up your network into subnets, your broadcasts will likey stay on the
subnet you're a part of.

<P>I've only commented the parts that are different from the directed_client.

<P>&nbsp;About that subnet thing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you run this client on a host that has multiple network
interfaces, the broadcast will go to all of those (sub)networks.&nbsp;
What do you do, though, if you need to get past a router?&nbsp; My advice
is to write a server that will run on hosts on both sides of your router.&nbsp;
When a server on one side of the router receives a broadcast, it would
send a directed datagram to it's counterpart on the other side of the router.&nbsp;
The counterpart would then re-broadcast the original datagram on that sub-net.&nbsp;
Cheap, simple and effective.</BLOCKQUOTE>
One final word of warning:
<BLOCKQUOTE>When creating your broadcast datagrams you may see something
like this:&nbsp; <I>ACE_SOCK_Dgram_Bcast::mk_broadcast: Broadcast is not
enable for this interface.: Unknown error</I>.&nbsp; There are some interfaces
(ppp, slip) that don't support broadcast datagrams.&nbsp; That's what you're
seeing here.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Ok, one more warning:
<blockquote>If you happen to have multiple servers running on your
network when you invoke this client, the response could come from any
one of them.
