<P>The first thing we want to look at is <A HREF="server.cpp">server.cpp</A>.&nbsp;
This is a pretty simple application that listens for datagrams at a known
port and sends back a response.&nbsp; In order to implement a true "discovery"&nbsp;
mechanism, the server will have to be a little bit more picky about who
it responds to.&nbsp; We'll tackle that issue in the next tutorial though...

<P>And that's really all there is to it.&nbsp; Obviously there is some
room for improvement.&nbsp; The most blatant is the somewhat small buffer
size for receiving the datagram.&nbsp; I've never been able to get a solid
answer on datagram sizes.&nbsp; The theoretical limit is just under 64k
but you have to deal with fragmentation.&nbsp; Some readings indicate that
8k is a reasonable size, others go much smaller.&nbsp; My general rule
of thumb is to keep datagrams relatively small (eg -- under 8k or so) and
test a lot.&nbsp; If you find that your routers are fragmenting your larger
datagrams, back off to something smaller.&nbsp; Of course, if you must
send 100k and can only do so 1k at a time, you'll have to worry about retransmissions
&amp; reordering.&nbsp; At that point, you might consider going to TCP.&nbsp;
Remember:&nbsp; datagrams are unreliable!&nbsp; Don't try to make 'em do
something they werent' designed for!
