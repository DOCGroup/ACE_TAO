    "Broadcast".  This ACE object is clever enough to go out to the OS
    and find all of the network interfaces.  When you send() on a
    Dgram_Bcast, it will send the datagram out on all of those
    interfaces.  This is quiet handy if you do it on a multi-homed

    respond to datagrams directed to this address the same as they
    would to datagrams sent to their hostname.

    Remember, the Dgram_Bcast will send a datagram to all interfaces
    on the host.  That's true even if the address is for a specific
    host (and the host address makes sense for the interface).  The
