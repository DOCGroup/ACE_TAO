<P>In <A HREF="directed_client.cpp">directed_client.cpp</A> we create a
client that knows how to send a datagram to a server on a known host.&nbsp;
This is a good thing if you know where the server lives and want to have
a conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Unix <I>talk</I> utilitiy, for instance,
could be written this way.

<P>That's all neat and good but the point of what we're doing here is not
to talk to a server we know about but to discover servers we don't know
about.&nbsp; Now, you could send a directed datagram to every possible
host address on your network but that's not a very nice thing to do.&nbsp;
On the next page, we'll find out the right approach...
