    Now, lets implement the Acceptor Service. As the first step, let
    us take a look at <I><A HREF="Acceptor_Service.h">Acceptor_Service.h</A></I>.

<font color=red>/* The Client_Handler object we develop will be used to handle clients

<font color=red>/* In our original simple server, we instantiated a
   ACE_Acceptor <Client_Handler, ACE_SOCK_ACCEPTOR> object. We can
   make it much simpler and efficient by inheriting our
   Acceptor_Service from ACE_Acceptor itself.

   Our Acceptor_Service class also needs to inherit from
   ACE_Service_Object. ACE_Service_Object is an abstract class which
   includes methods called by the Service Configurator framework to
   start, remove, suspend or resume our service.

   You might have noticed that we didnt explicitly inherit from
   ACE_Service_Object here. That is because, ACE_Acceptor derives from
   ACE_Service_Object and hence there is no explicitly specify it. */

library on Win.</font>

     suspend mode, the service is not removed completely and is *still
     there*. The difference is that the service is not in a active
     state and doesnot accept requests.*/ </font>

   even the statically linked services. */</font>
