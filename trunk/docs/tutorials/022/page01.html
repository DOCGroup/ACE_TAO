    <h1>ACE Tutorial 022</h1>
    <h1>Using Service Configurator Framework</h1>
    
    <P>Talking about distributed systems, almost means that
      there will be several processes or services running at all
      times. And it is a common scenario that only some or even just
      one of these services needs to be suspended or stopped
      altogether. In this scenario, how good it would be if we can
      configure just that service or services instead of affecting all
      the services leading to an overkill. And, how much convenient it
      would be if we can configure the services dynamically so that the
      services just need to reconfigured and not recompiled or
      shutdown completely.</P>

    <P>Service Configurator pattern helps in all these cases by
      enabling a service to be started, removed, suspended or resumed
      dynamically. It decouples the implementation and configuration
      of a service. New services can be added or unnecessary services
      can be removed or suspended.</P>

    <P>In this tutorial, we will use the simple server and client
      which we developed and used in our tutorial 005 as the base and
      modify as needed.</P>
