<CENTER>    <h1>Using Service Configurator Framework</h1> </CENTER>
    
    <P>When building distributed systems, there will almost certainly
    be multiple processes or services running at all
      times.  It is helpful if these services can (re)configured and
      control at installation-time or run-time. In this tutorial, we
      illustrate how to configure services in a fine-grained manner,
      rather than having to stop and restart all services in an application. </P>

    <P>The examples we show are based on the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/POSA/">Component Configurator</A> pattern,
      which enables a service to be started, removed, suspended or resumed
      dynamically. This pattern decouples the implementation of a
      service from its (re)configuration.  Thus, new services can be added or unnecessary services
      can be suspended or removed.</P>

    <P>In this tutorial, we will use the simple server and client
      which we developed and used in our tutorial 005 as the base and
      modify it as needed.</P>
