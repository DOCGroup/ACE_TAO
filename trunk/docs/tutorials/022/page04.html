   instance of this structure is statically initialized using this
   macro. The First parameter is SERVICE_CLASS i.e. the name of the
   class that implements the service. As we did implicitly, this class
   must derive from ACE_Service_Configurator. The second parameter is
   the NAME of the service. This name is used by the service
   configurator to match the configuration options provided in the
   svc.conf file. The third parameter is the type of the object which
   could be either streams or service objects. The next parameter is
   the name of the factory function which we defined in our header
   file and above using the macros ACE_FACTORY_DECLARE and
   ACE_FACTORY_DEFINE. The fifth parameter are a set of options or
   flags which are used to control the ownership and life cycle of the
   object. The final argument helps us to choose if we want a new
   thread for this service. If the argument is not 0, a thread will be
   dedicated to this service. .. lots of parameters .. Huh !! */  </font>
