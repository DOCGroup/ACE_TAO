<P>Like Tutorial 1, this is also a rather small program.&nbsp; I'm going
to add a couple of new ideas along the way but to make up for it I'm also
going to simplify the acceptor a great deal.

<P>
Kirthika's Abstract:
<UL>
This is a server example made simpler due to the use of off-the-shelf 
components and classes from ACE.
<P>
Here, the Logging_Acceptor is an ACE_Acceptor class which is associated
with the Logging_Handler and the ACE_SOCK_ACCEPTOR. This will now
accept connection requests from the clients on being opened with the
reactor instance passed to it.
<P>
We also implement a signal to capture CTRL-C [ which generates SIGINT ] using ACE_SigAction and
ACE_SignalHandler. This signal can now be used to stop the reactor
from handling events.
<P>
Then, the reactor is allowed to loop infintely until it is shut down
using a ^C, after which both the reactor as well as the acceptor are
destroyed.
<P>
The Logging_Handler derives from the ACE_Svc_Handler instead of the
Event_Handler since the Svc_Handler has inbuilt SOCK_Stream and
provides all the calls needed by the reactor. The Svc_Handler has the
ability to react to events and communicate to remote tasks using the
underlying data stream passed to it.
<P>
A timer is scheduled in the reactor which does nothing but simply
display how it could be used to provide periodic processing when
needed. The ACE_TimeValue is used to set the time period. 
<P>
Also, optimisations have been  made in the form of a separate function
for 
destroying the objects used.
<P>
Thus a simpler server has now been built which successfully
demonstrates how simple a task, writing a server can become on using
the various ACE components judiciously.
</UL>
<P>We begin by looking at the <A HREF="server.cpp">main (server.cpp)</A> portion program:
