In the previous tutorial we learned how to put text into a message queue.
While that may be useful, it isn't very exciting or realistic.  In most
cases you'll need to move complex data structures between your threads.
<P>
In this tutorial I'll expand the previous by moving not only a text string
but also a more complex object.  In the next tutorial I'll change things
again so that we move the complex object a bit more efficiently.
