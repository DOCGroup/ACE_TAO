It is important to notice here that we have done very little application-specifc
code in developing this object. In fact, if we take out the progress information,
the only app-specific code is when we create the new <I>Logging_Handler</I>
object to give to the <I>accept</I> function. You may begin to wonder why
there isn't a C++ template that does all of this coding for you. Actually,
the ACE toolkit happens to have one handy:
<UL>typedef ACE_Acceptor &lt;<I>YourHandlerClass</I>, ACE_SOCK_ACCEPTOR>
<I>YourAcceptorClass</I>;</UL>
We would have used it like this:
<UL>typedef ACE_Acceptor &lt;Logging_Handler, ACE_SOCK_ACCEPTOR> Client_Acceptor;</UL>
This will create a piece of code similar to what I've shown above. The
primary difference is that the <I>handle_input </I>function created by
the template does NOT register the handler with the reactor. In the long-run,
that is good for us because we can then move that logic into the <I>open</I>
function of the <I>Logging_Handler</I> and use a completely-generic acceptor.

<P>Now that we know how to accept a connection request, let's move on to
the next page where we learn how to handle the actual connection. Even
though we just learned about this cool template thing, we will continue
to use the "hand-written" acceptor developed above. As I mentioned, the
only difference will be in the <I>open</I> function of the connection handler
anyway.
