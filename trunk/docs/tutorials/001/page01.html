<hr>
<P>The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to create a very simple
server capable of handling multiple client connections. Unlike a &quot;traditional&quot;
server application, this one handles all requests in one process. Issues
of multi-processing and multi-threading will be handled in later tutorials.</P>

<P>

<P>What do you need to create a server?</P>

<OL>
<LI>Something which accepts connections from clients</LI>

<LI>Something which handles established connections</LI>

<LI>A main program loop that handles it all</LI>
</OL>

<P>The ACE&nbsp;Acceptor provides a solution for our first requirement.
This class is given a TCP/IP&nbsp;port number on which it will listen for
incoming connections. When a connection is attempted, the acceptor will
create a new object (the handler) to deal with the client connection while
the acceptor goes back to listening for other connections.</P>

<P>The ACE&nbsp;EventHandler solves our second requirement. This doesn't
seem obvious now but as we progress through this tutorial it will become
more clear.</P>

<P>Finally, a simple <I>main()</I> function will provide our program loop.
After any program initialization, it will enter an infinite loop which
waits for connection attempts to the Acceptor or data &quot;events&quot;
on the EventHandler.</P>

<P>Before we continue, I need to introduce one more ACE concept: the Reactor.
</P>

<P>I don't want to go into great detail at this time on what the Reactor
is, what it does and how it does it but it is necessary for you to understand
the basic function of a reactor because it is going to be in the first
piece of code you see.  The figure below depicts the interrelationships
between the Reactor, the Acceptor and the application handler.</P>
<P> <center> <img src="simple.gif" align=center> </center>

<P>Briefly:<BR>
The reactor is an object which reacts when things happen to other objects.
These things are called <I>events</I>. The <I>other objects</I> are communications
objects which you have <I>registered</I> with the reactor. At the time
of registration, you also specify which events you are interested in. The
reactor is notified by the operating system when the events of interest
occur within the registered objects. The reactor then uses member functions
of the registered object to process the event. Notice that the reactor
doesn't care what happens because of the event. It is the object's responsibility
to process the event correctly. The reactor simply notifies the object
of the event.</P>

<P>Why use the reactor?</P>

<P>That will become clear as the tutorial progresses. For now, however,
a brief answer would be this: it allows multiple simultaneous client connections
to be processed efficiently by a single-threaded server. </P>

<P>Servers have traditionally created a separate thread or process for
each client served. For large-volume services (such as telnet and ftp)
this is appropriate. However, for small-volume services the overhead of
process creation far outweighs the actual work being done. So... folks
begin using threads instead of processes to handle the clients. This is
good also but still, in some cases, the overhead is too much to bear. Instead,
why not have a single thread handle several clients and use a more intelligent
load-balancing methodology than one-thread-or-process-per-client?
<i>Caveat:  Handling all requests in one thread of one process is really
only good when the requests can be handled almost instantaneously.</i>
</P>

<P>This is where the reactor's power and flexibility come into play. The
developer can create a simple, single-threaded application that is later
modified to thread-per-client, process-per-client or thread-pool solution.
<P>
If all of this is gibberish and makes you think that ACE is way to hard to
learn, don't worry.  We'll go into all the details and explain as we go.
I only went into all of this so that it can kick around in the back of your
mind until you need it later.
