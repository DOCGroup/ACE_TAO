<P>From here, I want to move on to the main program loop. In a way, we're
starting at the final product when we do this, but it is a very simple
piece of code and a good place to start.

<P>The <A HREF="server.cpp">main</A>
program is really quite simple. The real work is done in the ACE derived
classes.

<PRE>/*
&nbsp; Include the header file where our client acceptor is defined.
&nbsp;*/
#include "ace/Reactor.h"

/*&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; For simplicity, we create our reactor in the global address space.
&nbsp; In later tutorials we will do something more clever and appropriate. However,
&nbsp; the purpose of this tutorial is to introduce a connection acceptance and
&nbsp; handling, not the full capabilities of a reactor.
*/
ACE_Reactor * g_reactor;

/*
&nbsp; Include the header where we define our acceptor object.&nbsp; An acceptor is
&nbsp; an abstraction that allows a server to "accept" connections from clients.
*/
#include "acceptor.h"

/*
&nbsp; A TCP/IP server can listen to only one port for connection requests.
&nbsp; Well-known services can always be found at the same address. Lesser-known
&nbsp; services are generally told where to listen by a configuration file or
&nbsp; command-line parameter. For this example, we're satisfied with simply hard-coding
&nbsp; a random but known value.

static const u_short PORT = ACE_DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT;

int main (int, char **)
{
&nbsp; /*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a Reactor instance.&nbsp; Again, a global pointer isn't exactly the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best way to handle this but for the simple example here, it will be OK.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll get cute with it later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Reactor, I'm skimming over the details of the ADDR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object. What it provides is an abstraction for addressing services in the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network. All we need to know at this point is that we are creating an address
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object which specifies the TCP/IP port on which the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will listen for new connection requests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objects have to be open()ed before they're of any use to you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this open() call, we're telling the acceptor where to listen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for connections via the 'addr' object.&nbsp; We're also telling it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that we want it to be registered with our 'g_reactor' instance.

&nbsp; /*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reactor's handle_events member function is responsible for looking at
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all registered objects and invoking an appropriate member function when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anything of interest occurs. When an event is processed, the handle_events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function returns. In order to get all events, we embed this in an infinite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we put ourselves into an infinite loop, you'll need to CTRL-C
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to exit the program.

<P>As I said, the main program is really quite simple:
<UL>
<LI>
Create an address for the <I>port</I> we want to listen to</LI>

<LI>
Create an acceptor which listens on that address</LI>

<LI>
Register the acceptor with a reactor to respond to the connection requests</LI>

<LI>
Enter an infinite loop to let the reactor handle the events</LI>
</UL>
On the next page, we will take a look at the acceptor and how it responds
to new connection requests.
