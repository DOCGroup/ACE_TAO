<P>Ok, so the last time around, we learned how to create a simple client
that can send a chunk of data.  A cooler thing to do is to overload
the C++ put operator (&lt;&lt;) to put some data for us.  That's what
we're going to do this time.  (This tutorial is actually where ACE_IOStream
was born.)
<P>
Kirthika says:
<UL>
The cool thing about this "cooler" client is how we use a C++ trick for
streaming incoming data by using the operator<<() method. Also the
Connector portion is wrapped in the open() method which now takes in the
server hostname and port. The result is a cleaner looking client which
successfully interacts with the server when connection is established.

<P>Ok, now we're done with that.  As you can see, it really isn't
so hard to create an object that makes sending data much more "natural"
than the typical send() or send_n() invocation.  You can even build
up arbitrary objects and do some neat tricks with C++ templates to stream
their data out as well.  (We may go into that a little later.)
Of course, writting the full implementation such that these streams are
interchangable with the standard C++ ostreams is quite a bit more difficult.
In addition, there are a lot of optimizations that this client would benefit
from!

<P>As an exercise to the reader (don't you hate those!) I challenge you
to write the server side of this.  You can take a  look at IOStream_Test
in the ACE distribution if you get stuck...

<P>If you want to compile it yourself, here's the <A HREF="client.cpp">source</A>,
the <A HREF="Makefile">Makefile</A>,
and <A HREF="00SetEnv">Environment
settings</A>.
