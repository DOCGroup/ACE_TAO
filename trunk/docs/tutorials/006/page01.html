<P>In this tutorial, we're going to extend Tutorial 5 to create a thread-per-connection
server.&nbsp; This implementation will create a new thread for each client
which connects to us.&nbsp; The ACE_Reactor is still used but only for
accepting new connections.&nbsp; The Client_Handler objects won't be registered
with the reactor.&nbsp; Instead, they'll be responsible for monitoring
their peer() directly.
<P>
Abstract:<sup>*</sup>
<ul>
Here, we build a thread-per-connection simple server. This is the next
step from a simple single-threaded server towards a multithreaded
server.
<p>
We make use of the Strategy Pattern in this example.
The ACE_Acceptor inherits form the ACE_Acceptor_Base class which
facilitates us to implement various different concurrency strategies
depending on whether the server is single-threaded or the server creates
a new thread per connection. This also allows us to extend the
capabilities of the server in the future by implementing a different
strategy.
<p>
This information is passed on to the Client_Handler
(remember ACE_Acceptor < Client_Handler, ACE_SOCK_ACCEPTOR > ?).
The Client_Handler is an ACE_Svc_Handler as the Svc_Handler is a
derivative of the Event_Handler and is associated with
ACE_Sock_Stream. It is also derived form the ACE_Task class which allows
us to have a thread per connection.
<p>
We incorporate the data processing in the svc() method, which will be
called per thread for the thread-per-connection server.
<p>
Note that here all the Client_Handler objects  aren't registered with the
reactor. The Reactor is only used to accept client connections. Once a
thread has been deicated per connection, the Client  Handler object
reponsible for that client connection now takes up the job of the
reactor and handles future events.
<p>
Thus a simple, thread-per-connection server has been built which doesnt
delve too deeply into mutli-threading issues.
