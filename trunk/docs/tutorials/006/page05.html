   In client_handler.h I alluded to the fact that we'll mess around with a
   Client_Acceptor pointer.  To do so, we need the Client_Acceptor object
   declaration.

   We know that including client_handler.h is redundant because
   client_acceptor.h includes it.  Still, the sentry prevents double-inclusion
   from causing problems and it's sometimes good to be explicit about what
   we're using.

   On the other hand, we don't directly include any ACE header files here.

<P>Well, that's it!&nbsp; After all the talk &amp; the hype, you would
have expected it to be more difficult to create a multi-threaded server.&nbsp;
Surprise!&nbsp; It really is that easy.&nbsp; You still have to handle
contention issues which we haven't addressed here and that is a rather
nasty topic.&nbsp; Still, for the simple case, this is all you have to
do.

<P>The next page is the last for this tutorial.&nbsp; Head on over there
&amp; we'll round up the file list one last time.
