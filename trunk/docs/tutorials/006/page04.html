shows a few more changes than the previous sources.&nbsp; The important
change is the addition of a svc() method where our connection thread will
exist.

   object hierarchy.  This is a requirement of the ACE_Reactor because
   it maintains ACE_Event_Handler pointers for each registered event
   handler.  You could derive our Client_Handler directly from
   ACE_Event_Handler but you still have to have an ACE_SOCK_Stream for
   the actually connection.  With a direct derivative of
   ACE_Event_Handler, you'll have to contain and maintain an
   ACE_SOCK_Stream instance yourself.  With ACE_Svc_Handler (which is
   a derivative of ACE_Event_Handler) some of those details are
   handled for you.

   thread-per-connection then our open() method will activate us into
   a thread.  At that point, our svc() method will execute.  We still

    invoke this method after creating a new Client_Handler when a

    up. Since an event handler can be registered for more than one
    type of callback, the callback mask is provided to inform
    handle_close() exactly which method failed.  That way, you don't
    have to maintain state information between your handle_* method
    calls. The &lt;handle> parameter is explained below...  As a

<P>So... we've added a svc() method and alluded to changes in open().&nbsp;
Let's move on to the object definition and see what all the fuss is about.
