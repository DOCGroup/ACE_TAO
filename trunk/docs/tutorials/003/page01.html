<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Now that we've seen how to create servers, let's spend just a moment
making a client. Since this is so easy, I'm going to do all of it in this
one page.

<P>
Kirthika says, "Here's an one paragraph abstract for a one page client app:"

<UL>
				The server is an Stream object of ACE_SOCK_Stream type. The
				ACE_Sock_Connector does the job of actively making a connection with the
				listening server. It does so using the server_host_address and port
				number which are stored in the ACE_INET_Addr object.Once the
				connection has been established, the client begins its interaction
				with the server and bombards it with messages.
				Note: send_n() call is used since this call sees to the issues of
				network buffering and reliably gets the data across to the server.
				Also, a timeout value is set to provide fault tolerance if the server
				ever dies before the transaction is completed. The server calls a
				close() method
				once it reads in zero bytes during the Event_Handler::handle_input()
				call. This
				proves that the client has severed its connection. The server then
				shuts down.

        data. That is due to network buffer availability and such. If
        the send() doesn't send all of the data, it is up to you to
        program things such that it will keep trying until all of the
        data is sent or simply give up. The send_n() function already
        does the "<font color=green>keep trying</font>" option for us, so we use it.

        Like the send() method used in the servers we've seen, there
        are two additional parameters you can use on the send() and
        send_n() method calls.  The timeout parameter limits the
        amount of time the system will attempt to send the data to the
        peer.  The flags parameter is passed directly to the OS send()
        system call.  See send(2) for the valid flags values.  */</font>

<P>Ok, so that was pretty easy. What would be even easier would be to wrap
all of the connection mess up in an object and overload a couple of basic
operators to make things less network-centric. Perhaps we'll see that in
another tutorial.

<P>If you want to compile it yourself, here's the <A HREF="client.cpp">source</A>,
the <A HREF="Makefile">Makefile</A>,
and <A HREF="00SetEnv">Environment
