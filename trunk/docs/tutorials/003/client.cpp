        the send() doesn't send all of the data, it is up to you to
        program things such that it will keep trying until all of the
        data is sent or simply give up. The send_n() function already
        does the "keep trying" option for us, so we use it.

        Like the send() method used in the servers we've seen, there
        are two additional parameters you can use on the send() and
        send_n() method calls.  The timeout parameter limits the
        amount of time the system will attempt to send the data to the

        system call.  See send(2) for the valid flags values.  */
