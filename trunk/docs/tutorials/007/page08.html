<P>Finally, <A HREF="thread_pool.cpp">thread_pool.cpp</A>
where we have the Thread_Pool object implementation.
<P>
Remember back in <A HREF="../006/page01.html">Tutorial 6</A> when I
      was talking about <i>THR_NEW_LWP</i>?  Look closely and you'll
      see it here.  It's bitwise OR'd with <i>THR_DETACHED</i> just to
      keep things interesting.
