<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
In this tutorial we've expanded on Tutorial 8 to provide a more discriminating
server application.&nbsp; The changes to the clients were trivial, amounting
to not much more than the addition of a timeout when reading a server's
potential response.&nbsp; The server change was a bit more since it had
to compare the clients' query with it's own signature.

<P>In a "real" system, the signatures you swap would probably include version
information.&nbsp; You could even use a major/minor scheme where an exact
match isn't necessary.&nbsp; Another upgrade might be to have a set of
signatures at one or both ends of the conversation.&nbsp; The level of
service provided by the server would be determined by the signature pair
match.
