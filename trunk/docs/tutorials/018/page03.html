Our Test object is a simple derivative of ACE_Task.  Although we've
certainly used templates in other tutorials, this is the first time
we've created one of our own.
<P>
In a lot of ways, you can think of templates as the sophisticated
cousin of the old C-style pre-processor macros.  With templates,
however, you get better type-checking and much easier debugging.  There 
are certainly other benefits but these are my favorites.
<P>
Our template's MUTEX parameter is used to set the mutex type
<i>mutex_t</i>.  That'll be used in svc() so that we can protect
shared resources needed during the processing of data received on our
message queue.
<P>
Note at the bottom how we have to include the <i>cpp</i> file
associated with us.  Most compilers have to see the definition of
templated classes along with their declaration.  You might be tempted, 
therefore, to just put the definitions in the header file.  Resist
that temptation because templates are one of the fastest growing areas 
of compilers.  Including the definition like we do here leads to long
compile times and overly-large binaries.  With luck, the compilers
will get smarter in the future and we won't need definition
inclusion.  If you've already got them broken out then you'll save
yourself a lot of time!

   force our client into using the run() method instead.

   The naming convention *_T is fairly typical for ACE.  The _T suffix
   on the object name (and it's source files) indicates that this is a 
   templated class.  Generally, there is a non-templated class defined 
   also such as foobar.h that would be included instead of foobar_T.h.
