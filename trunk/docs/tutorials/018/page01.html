Welcome to Tutorial 18!
<P>
We've seen various ACE methods for synchronization in this and other
tutorial sections.  Something we haven't yet seen is the ACE_Token.
ACE_Token has a really cool thing:  it behaves in a FIFO manner.
<P>
Why is that cool?
<P>
In the other tutorials, you may have found that one thread will end up 
with all of the work.  Even though other threads are available, the OS 
scheduling and lock management just causes it to happen.  With
ACE_Token, the threads are queued up on the token and served in a
traditional first-in-first-out manner.
<P>
Why is FIFO important?
<P>
Well, if your app is running in a bunch of threads and each is doing
the same thing on the local host then FIFO may not be important.
However, take the case where each thread is connected to a remote
system.  Let's say you have a dozen threads in your app and each is
connected to a different remote system.  Each of the threads will be
given a block of data which will be passed to the remote for some
intense calculation.  If you use the FIFO then you'll spread the work
more-or-less evenly between the remote peers.  If you use the
traditional mutex then one peer may get the lion's share of the work.
<P>
It gets down to a personal decision based on the application's needs.
Consider your application, examine its behavior & decide for yourself
if you want to spread the work evenly or if it's OK to let some
threads work harder than others.
