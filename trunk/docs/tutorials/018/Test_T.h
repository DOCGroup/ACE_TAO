   different locking mechanisms.  We've hidden the open() method to
   force our client into using the run() method instead.

   The naming convention *_T is fairly typical for ACE.  The _T suffix
   on the object name (and it's source files) indicates that this is a 
   templated class.  Generally, there is a non-templated class defined 
   also such as foobar.h that would be included instead of foobar_T.h.
