We'll go back to our tradition of looking at main() first.  The only
change here from our "normal" thread pool is the ability to specify
the number of subtasks for the pool.  (Each subtask is another thread
pool in the chain.  I suppose I should have named that better...)
I've still got the custom Message_Block so that, at this level, we
don't even know about custom Data_Blocks.

Nothing really surprising here...  Just remember that your total
number of threads is ( ( 1 + subtasks ) * threads ).  You probably
don't want to get too carried away with that!
