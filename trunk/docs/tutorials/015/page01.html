In a typical client/server system you will be sending and receiving
      data.  That's the whole point after all.
<P>
In the client/server tutorials that we've done so far it was just a
      matter of sending a buffer of data to the peer.  This was done
      with the send*() and recv*() methods of the ACE_SOCK* objects.
<P>
In a more robust system, one might want to process the data before
      sending it to a peer and "unprocess" it after reading from a
      peer.  These processing steps might include encryption,
      compression, applying checksums or any number of other actions.
<P>
In this tutorial a Protocol_Stream object is created to encrypt and
      compress* data being sent between peers.  Both client and server 
      applications are presented as well.  I present the application
level code first and then go into the details of the protocol stream
and it's helper objects.  If the stream stuff in the application logic 
is confusing then just read on by and come back to it after the later
discussions.

<ul>
Several folks have reported problems with this tutorial on Win32.
There are a couple of ways to solve this.  I've chosen to solve it by
using the ACE_Select_Reactor on all platforms instead of taking the
OS-default.

Kirthika's abstract:
<UL>
The Protocol Stream model consists of a stream layer which pushes the
data towards the underlying SOCK_Stream thru the stages of encryption
and compression. This data is received at the other end of the
SOCK_Stream and sent up to its Protocol_Stream layer via the stages of
decompression and decryption and an optional Reader task. This is very
similar to the model of the TCP/IP stack (specifically the datalink to
physical layer portion).
<P>
ACE_Message_Blocks are used to communicate between the client and the
server across the Protocol Stream, which abstracts the protocol
conformance details. The underlying SOCK_Stream is used to set up the
connection using the ACE_SOCK_Connector class. Once the connector
completes its job, the SOCK_Stream pointer is passed on to the
Protocol Stream which now takes over. The Client has put() and get()
methods to send and receive data from the server. 
<P>
The server is implemented using the ACE_Acceptor to listen at the port
for connections and a reactor for delegating events to the appropriate
event handler. The handle_input () method of the handler simply allows
the stream to receive the data and hand it over to the Handler_Task (a
derivative of the ACE_Task) which will then process it.
<P>
The implementation of this Protocol Stream model is done using the
ACE_Module class. The module for Xmit/Recv is shoved in first
into the stream, followed by the compression and encryption modules. The
optional Reader if defined is bundled with a dummy task
(ACE_Thru_Task class) into a module. The get() and put() methods do
the job of reading and writing to the Stream. Each module is made up
of a pair of Protocol Tasks. A Protocol Task is a derivative of the
ACE_Task and whose recv() and send() methods need to be filled to
perform the appropriate task.
<P>
The Xmit object derives from the Protocol task and has a send() method
which does the task of transmitting data to the underlying
SOCK_Stream. Keeping the fragmentation and reassembly issues in mind,
block-size is also sent across with the block of data.
The Recv object uses a dummy Message Block to provoke the Protocol
Task object to call the recv() on it. This is done by being
foresighted about the use of mutliple threads instead of a single
thread.
<P>
The compression/decompression is bundled in a single Protocol Task
object with the send () method doing the compression and the recv()
doing the decompression. Similarly, the encrption/decryption is done
using a single Protocol Task object.
<P>
This tutorial provides a glimpse on how to design and implement a
protocol in layers and also revises a lot of what has been learnt until
now from the previous tutorials.
(for instance, Message_Block, Task, Acceptor, Connector, Event_Handler
etc.)

<font size=-1>* Ok, I didn't really implement encryption and
        compression objects.  I'll leave that as a thought
        exercise!</font>
