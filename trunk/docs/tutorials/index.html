<H3>ACE Tutorial Introduction</H3><P>

The original audience for these tutorials was the <A
HREF="http://www.lads.com">Automated Design Systems</A> (ADS) IPC
team, lead by <A HREF="mailto:jcej@lads.com">James Johnson</A>. Since
then, the scope has been changed to include anyone who wants to learn
about the ACE framework. Hopefully, even experienced ACE programmers
will find something new here. With a framework as encompassing as ACE,
it is easy to become an expert in one area and know little or nothing
about others.

What is ACE?</H3>
The <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</A> framework
was developed mostly by <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">Douglas
C. Schmidt's</A> team at Washington University. The framework attempts
to abstract the details of many things across many operating systems. Some
of the things abstracted include: network programming, multi-threading,
shared memory and resource locking. ACE has been <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/etc/ACE-porting.html">ported</A>
and tested on a wide range of OS platforms including <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Win32</A>
(i.e., WinNT 3.5.x, 4.x, Win95, and WinCE using MSVC++ and Borland C++
on Intel and Alpha platforms), most versions of UNIX (e.g., <A HREF="http://www.sun.com">Solaris</A>
1.x and 2.x on SPARC and Intel, <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI IRIX</A>
5.x and 6.x, DG/UX, <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP-UX</A> 9.x, 10.x, and
11.x, <A HREF="http://www.unix.digital.com/">DEC UNIX</A> 3.x and 4.x,
<A HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/software/aix_os.html">AIX</A> 3.x and
4.x, DG/UX, UnixWare, <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/">SCO</A>, and freely
available UNIX implementations like <A HREF="http://www.labs.redhat.com/">Linux</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>),
real-time operating systems (e.g., <A HREF="http://www.lynx.com/">LynxOS</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.wrs.com">VxWorks</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.isi.com/">PSoS</A>),
and <A HREF="http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/index.html">MVS OpenEdition</A>.
A single <A HREF="ACE-directory.html">source tree</A> is used for all these
platforms. There is also a <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~eea1/JACE.html">Java</A>
version of ACE.<P>

<H3>Why Use ACE?</H3>
A key reason to use ACE is simple: <I>write a multi-threaded networked
application on one platform and quickly be able to use it on another</I>.
This is important for many projects because it is necessary for applications
to communicate with one another. For instance, many applications will exist
on both UNIX and Win32 platforms within a local area network. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H3>What about TAO?</H3>
In the early stages, these tutorials won't address The ACE ORB (<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">TAO</A>).
However, if you want to request a tutorial on some aspect of TAO or even
create one yourself, I'll be glad to integrate those into these tutorials.
It's rare when folks want to write documentation, so nothing will be refused!

<H3>The Tutorials</H3><P>

The following tutorials have been designed to guide you through the
process of learning ACE.  We will continue to add new tutorials over
time. <P>
