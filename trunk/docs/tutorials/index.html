<H2>Who should be reading this?</H2>

<P>
The original audience was the ADS IPC team.  Since then, the scope has been
changed to include anyone wanting to learn about the ACE framework.  Hopefully,
even experienced ACE programmers will find something new here.  With a framework
as encompassing as ACE, it is easy to become an expert in one area and know little
or nothing about others.

<H2>What is ACE?</H2>

<P>The ACE library was developed mostly by
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">Douglas C. Schmidt's</A>
team at Washington
University. The library attempts to abstract the details of many things
across many operating systems. Some of the things abstracted include: network
programming, multi-threading, shared memory and resource locking. The library
has been ported to many Unix variants as well as Win32 (NT/95).</P>

<P>The reason to use ACE is simple: write a multi-threaded networked application
on one platform and quickly be able to use it on another. This is important
in the scope of the AMS project because it will be necessary for the many
AMS applications to communicate with one another. The applications will
exist on Unix and Win32 platforms within a local area network.</P>

<H2>What about TAO?</H2>

<P>In the early stages, these tutorials won't address The ACE Orb 
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">TAO</A>).
However... if you want to request a tutorial on some aspect of TAO or even create
one yourself, I'll be glad to integrate those into these tutorials.  It's rare
when folks want to write documentation, nothing will be refused :-></P>
