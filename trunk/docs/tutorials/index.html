<H3>ACE Tutorials</H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

The original audience for these tutorials was the <A
HREF="http://www.lads.com">Automated Design Systems</A> (ADS) IPC
team, lead by <A HREF="mailto:jcej@lads.com">James Johnson</A>.  Since
then, the scope has been changed to include anyone who wants to learn
about the ACE framework.  Hopefully, even experienced ACE programmers
will find something new here.  With a framework as encompassing as
ACE, it is easy to become an expert in one area and know little or
nothing about others. <P>

<H3>What is ACE?</H3>

The <A HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a>
framework was developed mostly by <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">Douglas C. Schmidt's</A> team
at Washington University. The framework attempts to abstract the
details of many things across many operating systems. Some of the
things abstracted include: network programming, multi-threading,
shared memory and resource locking.

<H3>Why Use ACE?</H3>

A key reason to use ACE is simple: <EM>write a multi-threaded
networked application on one platform and quickly be able to use it on
another</EM>. This is important for many projects because it is
necessary for applications to communicate with one another.  For
instance, many applications will exist on both UNIX and Win32
platforms within a local area network.</P>

<H3>What about TAO?</H3>

<P>In the early stages, these tutorials won't address The ACE ORB (<A
HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt">TAO</A>).  However, if you
want to request a tutorial on some aspect of TAO or even create one
yourself, I'll be glad to integrate those into these tutorials.  It's
rare when folks want to write documentation, so nothing will be
refused!  </P>
