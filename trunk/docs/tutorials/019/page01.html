      Did you ever wish you could read someone's mind?  Or that they could
      read yours?
    <p>
      Well, we won't be doing that here but we'll try to get close by
      letting your code do something similar:  Shared Memory.
    <p>
      What we're going to do is ask the operating system to set
      aside a part of RAM that we can share with another process.  By
      doing this, we can allow our applications to swap data very
      efficiently.
    <p>
      Along the way, we'll have to come up with some sort of
      coordintation betweent the processes.  That is the most
      difficult part of a shared memory system.  In the tutorial we're 
      just going to take a simplistic approach (eg -- busy loop) but
      real-world applications will need to take a serious look at
      process-level synch mechanisms such as ACE_*_Semaphore.
    <P>
      Caveat:  I've barely begun to use shared memory
      myself.  This tutorial and the next are very simple-minded and 
      primitive.  Anyone who wants to provide more realistic
      replacements is encouraged to drop me a note
      (<A HREF="mailto:jcej@lads.com">jcej@lads.com</A>).
