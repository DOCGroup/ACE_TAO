We'll first take a look at the server side.  As usual with
co-operating applications, you need the server up and running first.
In the case of shared memory applications, the server will create the
shared memory segment.  In this example, it will also remove the
segment when done.  It is important to realize though that the segment
can be created external to your application and can persist beyond
it's lifetime.  In fact, you can use shared memory to create a layer
of persistence between application instances (at least, until the
machine comes down.)

    You can use the ACE_Malloc template to create memory pools
    from various shared memory strategies.  It's really cool.
    We're not going to use it.

    Instead, I want to get to the roots of it all and directly
    use ACE_Shared_Memory_SV.  Like many ACE objects, this is a
    wrapper around OS services.

    With this constructor we create a shared memory area to
    use.  The ACE_CREATE flag will cause it to be created if it
    doesn't already exist.  The SHM_KEY value (from shmem.h)
    uniquely identifies the segment and allows other apps to
    attach to the same segment. Execute 'ipcs -m' before and
    after starting this app to see that the segment is created.
    (I can't for the life of me correlate the SHM_KEY value back
    to the key/id reported by ipcs though.)
