/** A wrapper for ACE_Condition<>.  When you're using an
    ACE_Condition<> you have to have three things: - Some variable
    that embodies the condition you're looking for - A mutex to
    prevent simultaneous access to that variable from different
    threads - An ACE_Condition<> that enables blocking on state
    changes in the variable The class I create here will contain those
    three things.  For the actual condition variable I've chosen an
    integer.  You could easily turn this class into a template
    parameterized on the condition variable's data type if 'int' isn't
    what you want.  */

  /* I've created a number of arithmetic operators on the class that
     pass their operation on to the variable.  If you turn this into a
     template then some of these may not be appropriate...  For the
     ones that take a parameter, I've stuck with 'int' instead of
     'value_t' to reinforce the fact that you'll need a close look at
     these if you choose to change the 'value_t' typedef.  */

  /* These four operators perform the actual waiting.  For instance:

     bool operator!=(int _value)

     is implemented as:

     Guard guard(mutex_)
     while( value_ != _value )
     condition_.wait();

     This is the "typical" use for condition mutexes.  Each of the
     operators below behaves this way for their respective
     comparisions.

     To use one of these in code, you would simply do:

     Condition mycondition;
     ...
     // Wait until the condition variable has the value 42
     mycondition != 42
     ...  */

  // As long as the condition variable is NOT EQUAL TO <value>, we wait
  bool operator!= (value_t value);

  // As long as the condition variable is EXACTLY EQUAL TO <value>, we
  // wait
  bool operator== (value_t value);

  // As long as the condition variable is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
  // <value>, we wait
  bool operator<= (value_t value);

  // As long as the condition variable is GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
  // <value>, we wait
  bool operator>= (value_t value);

  // Return the value of the condition variable
  operator value_t (void);

  /* In addition to the four ways of waiting above, I've also create a
     method that will invoke a function object for each iteration of
     the while() loop.  Derive yourself an object from
     Condition::Compare and overload operator()(value_t) to take
     advantage of this.  Have the function return non-zero when you
     consider the condition to be met.  */

     This is a little odd since we're not really testing equality.
