The ACE framework has quite a few objects for syncronizing your
threads and even processes.  We've mentioned a few in passing already: 
 ACE_Thread_Mutex and ACE_Barrier for instance.
<P>
Another interesting one is the ACE_Condition template.  By using an
ACE_Condition you can have your code wait for an arbitrary condition 
to occur.  That condition is "embodied" in a variable of your choice.
That variable can, in turn, be any data type you wish.  This makes
ACE_Condition much more flexible than a simple mutex, barrier or
semaphore.
<P>
In this tutorial, I'll create a wrapper class around the ACE_Condition 
and the assorted housekeeping items necessary to make it work.  I'll
use a simple integer as the condition variable but keep in mind that
you can use any data type you want.
