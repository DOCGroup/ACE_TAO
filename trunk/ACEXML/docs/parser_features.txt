@{

There are special features in ACEXML Parser that can be
activated/deactivated thru @c setFeature.  Likewise, whether a feature
has been activated or not can be queried using @c getFeature.

@sa ACEXML_XMLReader::setFeature
@sa ACEXML_XMLReader::getFeature

Here is a list of supported features:

<OL>
  <li> namespaces - When this feature is enabled, ACEXML parser allows
  access by namespace qualified names.

  <li> namespace_prefixes - Normally the list of attributes returned by the
  parser will not contain attributes used as namespace declarations
  (xmlns:foo="bar"). When this feature is enabled, the list of attributes
  contains the namespace declarations also.
</OL>
