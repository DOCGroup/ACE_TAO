/**
@page acexml_bugs ACEXML Known Bugs

<ul>
  <li>ACEXML currently do not validate an XML files.  The validator
      hooks have not fully integrated into the parser yet.

  <li>Exception handling is not implemented.  Currently, we use a
      reference of ACEXML::Env, similar to CORBA::Environment, to return
      the status of the execution. ACEXML will reuse the ACE CORBA macros
      to support native exceptions on platforms that support them.

  <li>Need to verify predefined entities are working correctly.  Check
      out the SAXPrint example.

  <li>Currently, replacement of parameterized reference (PEReference) is
      not working.

  <li>The encoding attributes in xml decl element is ignored. We have
      no plan to support different character encoding other than
      UNICODE ones.

</ul>
