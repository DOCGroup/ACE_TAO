/**
@page acexml_bugs ACEXML Known Bugs

<ul>
  <li>ACEXML currently do not validate an XML files.  The validator
      hooks have not fully integrated into the parser yet.

  <li>Exception handling is not implemented.  Currently, we use a
      reference of ACEXML::Env, similar to CORBA::Environment, to
      return the status of the execution.  We should consider reusing
      the ACE CORBA macros to support native exceptions on platforms
      that support them.

  <li>Need to verify predefined entities are working correctly.  Check
      out the SAXPrint example.

  <li>Currently, replacement of parameterized reference (PEReference) is
      not working.

  <li>Although most namespace supporting features/interfaces are
      there, the parser currently does not interpret namespace.

  <li>The encoding attributes in xml decl element is ignore.  We have
      no plan to support different character encoding other than
      UNICODE ones.

  <li>I'm sure this list will grow. :)

</ul>
