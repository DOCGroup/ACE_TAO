  <li>ACEXML currently do not validate an XML files.  The validator
      hooks have not fully integrated into the parser yet.

  <li>Need to verify predefined entities are working correctly.  Check
      out the SAXPrint example.

  <li>Currently, replacement of parameterized reference (PEReference) is
      not working.
