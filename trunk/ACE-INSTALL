  Supported Platforms and Compilers
  
   The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment has been ported and tested
   extensively on a wide range of C++ compilers and uni-processor and
   multi-processor OS platforms including Win32 (i.e., WinNT and Win95),
   most versions of UNIX (e.g., SunOS 4.x and 5.x, SGI IRIX, DG/UX,
   HP-UX, OSF/1 a.k.a. DEC UNIX, AIX 4.x, Linux, SCO, UnixWare, and
   FreeBSD), [7]VxWorks, and [8]MVS OpenEdition. If you have a problem
   compiling the ACE wrappers on the platforms shown below please send
   email to the [9]ACE mailing list and we'll try to fix it for you.
   
   Win32 (Windows NT and Windows '95) 
          
          All of ACE has been ported to the Win32 API (which includes
          Windows NT and Windows '95). The entire release now compiles
          using the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x and 5.0 compilers (the 2.0
          compiler may also work, but we haven't tested it recently). ACE
          can be built as both a static and dynamic library, using the
          Win32 installation process described below.
          
   Sun OS 5.x/4.x (a.k.a. Solaris 2.x/1.x) using Sun CC 3.0.1, Sun C++
          4.0.x, Centerline C++ 2.x, and GNU gcc 2.7.x. 
          
          All the source code and tests should build and run without any
          problems on the Solaris and SunOS platforms using the Sun C++
          compilers.
          
   Sun OS 4.1.x using Centerline C++ 2.x, Sun CC 3.x, and Lucid Energize
          3.2. 
          
          Note that shared libraries do not interact very well with
          Centerline C++ or Sun C++ on SunOS 4.1.x. This is due to odd
          behavior of the SunOS 4.1.x linker, which (1) does not properly
          call constructors of global objects within shared libraries and
          (2) does not call the init() and fini() functions in shared
          libraries, even though the manual claims that these functions
          are called! In particular, this means that the tests in the
          directory
          $(ACE_ROOT)/tests/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/ will
          not work for statically linked services...
          
          Some versions of SunOS 4.1.x do not contain the
          /usr/lib/libnsl.a library. This library seems to be optional
          since System V Transport Layer Interface (TLI) support is
          optional on SunOS 4.1.x (in contrast, it's the "preferred"
          transport interface on Solaris).
          
          The best work-around for now is probably to either add a dummy
          libnsl.a in /lib (which may not be feasible) or simply comment
          out the line:
          
          LIBS += -lnsl
          
          in the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU file.
          Naturally, any programs (e.g., the TLI_SAP tests) that use the
          TLI wrappers aren't going to work!
          
          Note that on SunOS 4.x you may get warnings from the linker
          that "archive has no table of contents; add one using
          ranlib(1)" for certain libraries (e.g., libASX.a, libThreads.a,
          and libSPIPE.a). This occurs since SunOS 4.x does not support
          these features.
          
   AIX 
          
          The ACE port to AIX assumes that the user has installed the AIX
          patch containing the dl*() APIs. To use these APIs, IBM has
          created a separate product (free to AIX licensees) called
          shared library hookable symbols (or slhs/6000). If you don't
          have this patch, the sv* commands for compiling and linking
          will not be present on the system.
          
          BTW, here's a technique from Rob Jordan
          <[10]jordan@hursley.ibm.com> that can reduce the size of the
          ACE libraries by about one third, and can also be applied to
          applications. It works by optimising the sharing of template
          functions, which are created in an ``unusual'' way under AIX.
          It also speeds up compilation.
          
          Here's how to optimise the ACE library generation:
          
          Look at the [11]Makefile in $ACE_ROOT/ace. Create a file called
          ACE_All_Src.cpp, and add a line to #include each of the source
          files listed under FILES= in the Makefile. Create a file called
          ACE_All_Tmp.h and add a line to #include each of the .h files
          listed under TEMPLATE_FILES= in the Makefile. Now update the
          Makefile so that FILES=ACE_All_Src and
          TEMPLATE_FILES=ACE_All_Tmp.
          
   Linux and SCO 4.2 
          
          ACE has been ported to [12]Linux and SCO UNIX using the GNU G++
          2.7.2 compiler.
          
   SGI IRIX 5.x and 6.x 
          
          ACE used to build fine using the SGI C++ and GNU GCC compilers
          for IRIX 5.x. It has been ported to IRIX 6.x using the SGI
          MipsPro 7.1 C++ compiler; be aware that in IRIX 6.2 there is a
          number of patches that have to be installed and exceptions
          appear to fail with the O32 ABI. Please check the config files
          for the details.
          
   HP-UX 9.x and 10.x 
          
          The current HP/UX C++ compiler is incredibly lame and has
          problems compiling ACE templates and achieving template
          closure. I've heard that the next release is better... In the
          meantime, you might try using GNU GCC or SunC++ on HP/UX.
          
   OSF/1 3.2 and 4.0 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX 4.0a) 
          
          The current OSF/1 C++ 5.4 compiler still seems to have problems
          with ACE's templates. It compiles the lib and test programs,
          although giving warnings about template usage. Most tests run,
          some dump core. Hopefully newer compiler releases will
          alleviate these problems.
          
          GNU gcc 2.7.2.1 compiles without problems. All tests run
          (besides minor problems). Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <[13]
          kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de> and David Trumble
          <[14]trumble@cvg.enet.dec.com> for help with this port.
          
   UnixWare 2.01 
          
          Steve Huston <[15]shuston@riverace.com> has ported ACE to work
          with UnixWare 2.01 and its standard C++ compiler.
          
   VxWorks
          
          [16]David Levine <[17]levine@cs.wustl.edu> has ported ACE to
          VxWorks 5.2/5.3/5.3.1 with the GreenHills 1.8.8 and g++ 2.7.2
          compilers.
          
          In addition to all of the other benefits of ACE, it helps work
          around some deficiencies with VxWorks 5.3/5.3.1. Some of these
          apply only with g++, at least thru version 2.7.2. That is the
          version that is shipped with Tornado 1.0.1/ VxWorks 5.3.1. The
          problems are:
          
         1. The program entry point cannot be called ``main''. ACE
            renames it to ``ace_main'' on VxWorks. While this may seem
            trivial, it is important with legacy code. ACE itself ran
            into this problem.
         2. argc/argv isn't used with VxWorks entry points. ACE provides
            a wrapper function that transparently converts shell command
            line arguments to argc/argv form. See [18]below for details.
         3. Unsigned long long support is not available with the g++ that
            is distributed with Tornado 1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1, or with
            GreenHills 1.8.8. The documentation says that it is supported
            by g++, but try using it :-) Wind River technical support
            verified that it doesn't work. ACE provides its own 64-bit
            unsigned integer type, ACE_hrtime_t, so you don't even have
            to worry about this problem if you use it.
         4. There a gory problem with munch that is severely aggravated
            by the presence of a static in the Wind River/g++ iostream.h.
            ACE hides this and provides an easy-to-use workaround in the
            very unlikely situation where it becomes a problem. Please
            see ace/config-vxworks5.2-g++.h for more information.
            
          In addition, as noted [19]below following the discussion of the
          g++ -fno-implicit-templates option, -fno-implicit-templates is
          broken. And, -O2 is not supported on some targets.
          
          The current version of ACE, 4.3, has limited support for
          destroying static objects after program termination on VxWorks.
          To destroy static objects, the module must be unloaded, using
          unld. Static constructors are called when loading the module,
          with ld.
          
   MVS OpenEdition
          
          All of ACE has been ported to OpenEdition by Chuck Gehr
          <[20]gehr@sweng.stortek.com>. The ACE library, all the tests
          and most of the examples and apps build clean. There are still
          some problems that need to be ironed out:
          
          MVS does not support the dynamic linking dl...() calls that the
          Service Configurator uses to dynmically link services at run
          time. As a result, all the examples and apps that use a
          svc.conf file (for dynamically configuring service objects) do
          not work, however, most of these apps can be built/run
          statically. Also, the Svc_Conf_l.cpp and Svc_Conf_y.cpp files
          are generated using flex and yacc on a ascii (not ebcdic)
          machine and as a result they don't work very well with ebcdic
          svc.conf files. We should be able to regenerate these files on
          MVS but MVS doesn't have flex. This is something that needs to
          be done.
          
          Some of the tests do not execute properly. This is a minority
          and over time the goal is to get to 100%.
          
          The make scheme for some of the apps still doesn't work
          perfectly on MVS. This is mainly due to the way shared
          libraries are handled on MVS. See [21]additional build tips for
          MVS for more on this.

    Compiling ACE with GNU C++
    
   If you use the GNU GCC C++ compiler please note the following:
   
     * Earlier versions of G++ may not compile certain parts of ACE
       correctly due to compiler bugs. Please upgrade to G++ 2.7.2 or
       greater.
     * Make sure to update your gcc "config.status" file - this specifies
       whether your gcc install uses, for example, Solaris's
       "/usr/ccs/bin" binary utils or GNU binary utils.
     * Make sure that the linker invoked by GCC produces code that
       initializes static objects. Please see GCC's documentation for
       using collect2.
     * By default, gcc (thru version 2.7.2, at least) uses implicit
       template instantiation. Besides wasting space, this breaks the use
       of ACE_Singleton: instead of one singleton instance, there could
       be one instance per object (.o) file that "sees" the template.
       Therefore, we have overridden this default in ACE by enabling the
       -fno-implicit-templates option to CCFLAGS in all
       include/makeinclude/platform_*.GNU files that set CXX to g++.
     * The disadvantage of this approach is that you must add template
       specializations for all templates that your application uses to
       your own code. (The ACE libraries are self-contained: you don't
       need to add the templates that they use internally.) Examples of
       template specializations occur in quite a few ACE .cpp files; see
       apps/Gateway/Gateway/Proxy_Handler.cpp for one example. An easy
       way to figure out what template instantiations are need is to try
       to build your executable and pipe the output through c++filt. The
       linker will report the missing instantiations as undefined
       symbols. Iteration may be necessary, if the template
       instantiations themselves reference other templates.
     * Alternatively, you could apply the Cygnus template repository
       patches and use the -repo option instead of
       -fno-implicit-templates. Please see the g++ FAQ and gcc manual for
       more information. The g++ FAQ indicates that a new implementation
       of templates planned for version 2.8 will eliminate the
       restriction against static data members in template classes, which
       would allow ready implementation of a correct ACE_Singleton. A
       final alternative is to remove the -fno-implicit-templates option
       from the CCFLAGS macro in your
       include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU, and thereby use the
       default g++ implicit template instantiation.
     * Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <[22] kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
       for reporting the problem with ACE_Singleton on g++, and for
       helping to find and implement these solutions.
     * On VxWorks only, g++ (thru version 2.7.2, at least, distributed
       with Tornado 1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1), -fno-implicit-templates is
       broken. In addition, -O2 is not supported on some targets.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Building and Installing ACE
  
   The following explains how to build the ACE on [23]UNIX and [24]Win32.
   
    Building and Installing ACE on UNIX
    
   Building and installing ACE on UNIX is relatively simple (the
   [25]process for Win32 is different). Here's what you need to do:
   
    1. Install GNU make 3.7 or greater on your system (available via
       anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu directory).
    2. Add an environment variable called ACE_ROOT that contains the name
       of the root of the directory where you keep the ACE wrapper source
       tree. The ACE recursive Makefile scheme needs this information.
       There are several ways to set the ACE_ROOT variable. For instance,
       in my .login file I have the following entry:

% setenv ACE_ROOT /home/cs/faculty/schmidt/ACE_wrappers
       However, if you're building a number of versions of ACE (e.g., for
       different OS platforms or for different releases of ACE) you might
       use the following approach:

% setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd
    3. Edit the $ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h file to update things like default
       hostname and port numbers you'd like the programs in the
       $ACE_ROOT/{apps,tests} directories to use by default.
    4. Set the $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h file to point to the appropriate
       platform/compiler-specific header configurations (such as
       config-sunos5-sunc++-4.x.h). This file contains the #defines that
       are used throughout ACE to indicate which features your system
       supports (see the $ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h file for many examples of how
       the ACE build configuration is affected by these macro settings).
       There are config files for most versions of UNIX. If there isn't a
       version of this file that matches your platform/compiler, you'll
       need to make one. Please send me email if you get it working so I
       can add it to the master ACE release.
    5. Set the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU file to
       point to the appropriate platform/compiler-specific Makefile
       configurations (e.g., platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU). This file
       contains the compiler and Makefile directives that are
       platform/compiler-specific
    6. Note that since ACE builds shared libraries, you'll need to set
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH to whereever you put the binary version of the ACE
       library. For example, you probably want to do something like the
       following

% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    7. When all this is done, hopefully all you'll need to do is type:

% make
       at the root of the ACE source tree. This will build the static and
       shared object libraries and build the tests and the sample
       applications.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    Building and Installing ACE on Win32
    
   ACE contains project files for Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x (*.mdp) and
   5.0 (*.dsw).
   
    1. Create a directory (e.g., C:\ACE) and copy all of the ACE
       distribution into it. This directory will be referred to as
       ACE_ROOT in the rest of this discussion.
    2. Create a file called config.h in the ACE_ROOT\ace directory that
       contains:
       #include "config-win32.h"
    3. Now load up the project file for ACE (ACE_ROOT\ace\ace.mdp or
       ACE_ROOT\ace\ace.dsw). If you are using MSVC 4.x, you will need to
       add paths to your global settings. In Tools|Options|Directories,
       add ACE_ROOT to your include path and ACE_ROOT\ace to your library
       path.
    4. Each project will contain 8 different configurations. These are a
       mixture of Debug/Release, Unicode/non-Unicode, and Static/Dynamic
       library versions. Note: If you use the dynamic libraries, make
       sure you include ACE_ROOT\ace in your PATH whenever you run
       programs that use ACE.
    5. If you are building for Windows NT and plan to use the STL
       implementation that comes with ACE, then you can start building
       now. If you are building on Windows 95, then you should add the
       line
       #define ACE_HAS_WINNT4 0
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h and it will
       turn off Windows NT 4 specific code.
       If you want to use the standard C++ headers (iostream, cstdio, ...
       as defined by the C++ Standard Draft 2) that comes with MSVC 5,
       then add the line
       #define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY 1
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h.
       The default project files which build ACE library have various
       configurations to build dynamic/static, with or without Unicode
       support. Although we recommend using the dynamic library, if, for
       some reasons, you would rather work with static library, you'll
       need to add the line
       #define ACE_HAS_DLL 0
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h. Optionally
       but highly recommended, you can also add the line
       #define __ACE_INLINE__ 0
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h to disable
       inline function and reduce the size of static libraries (and your
       executables.)
       
   ACE TESTS
   
   The tests are located in ACE_ROOT\tests. There are two corresponding
   project files in that directory also (tests.mdp and tests.dsp).
   
   Once you build all the tests (Batch Build works well for this) you can
   run the batch file run_tests.bat in that directory to try all the
   tests.
   
   BUILDING ACE ON A WIN32 MACHINE THAT LACKS A NETWORK CARD 
   
   You may want to run ACE on a non-networked machine. To do so, you must
   install TCP/IP and configure it to ignore the absence of a network
   card. This is one method:
   
    1. Run Control Panel
    2. Choose Network from Control Panel
    3. Add Adapter: MS Loopback Adapter
    4. Configure MS Loopback Adapter with 802.3 (default)
    5. Add Software: TCP/IP Protocol
    6. Configure TCP/IP Protocol with a valid IP address and subnet mask.
       Leave everything else at the default settings.
    7. Add Software: Workstation
    8. Exit and Restart System
    9. Run Control Panel again
   10. Choose Services from Control Panel
   11. The following services are not necessary and may be set to
       Disabled Startup:
       Alerter
       Computer Browser
       Net logon
       Messanger
   12. Choose Network from Control Panel
   13. Confirm the following setup. This is all you need to run ACE:
       Installed Software:
       Computer Browser
       MS Loopback Adapter Driver
       TCP/IP Protocol
       Workstation
       Installed Adapter Cards:
       MS Loopback Adapter
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    Building and Installing ACE on VxWorks
    
   For the most part, you should be able to follow the instructions above
   to build ACE and applications that use it. Use the [26]Unix
   instructions for Unix hosts, or [27]Win32 instructions for Windows NT
   hosts.
   
   You'll have to let ACE know the target type at compile time. There are
   several ways to do this; please see the
   $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU platform
   file for detailed information.
   
   The VxWorks platform_vxworks*.GNU files are set up so that shared
   libraries are not built on VxWorks. Only static libraries, with .a
   extension, are built. Therefore, it's not necessary to set the
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on your host system when building
   for VxWorks targets.
   
   These non-default VxWorks kernel configuration #defines are required
   with ACE:
   
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS           /* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS /* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */

   For completeness, here are the non-default #defines that we use for
   VxWorks 5.3.1/g++ 2.7.2:

#define INCLUDE_CPLUS           /* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS /* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_CONFIGURATION_5_2 /* pre-tornado tools */
#define INCLUDE_DEBUG           /* pre-tornado debugging */
#define INCLUDE_LOADER          /* object module loading */
#define INCLUDE_NET_SYM_TBL     /* load symbol table from network */
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL_SYNC    /* synchronize host and target symbol tables */
#define INCLUDE_NFS             /* nfs package */
#define INCLUDE_PING            /* ping() utility */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */
#define INCLUDE_RDB             /* remote debugging package */
#define INCLUDE_RLOGIN          /* remote login */
#define INCLUDE_RPC             /* rpc package */
#define INCLUDE_SECURITY        /* shell security for network access */
#define INCLUDE_SHELL           /* interactive c-expression interpreter */
#define INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES   /* show routines for system facilities*/
#define INCLUDE_SPY             /* spyLib for task monitoring */
#define INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT  /* execute start-up script */
#define INCLUDE_STAT_SYM_TBL    /* create user-readable error status */
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL         /* symbol table package */
#define INCLUDE_UNLOADER        /* object module unloading */
#define INCLUDE_WINDVIEW        /* WindView command server */

   It probably wouldn't take much effort to modify the ACE library to not
   require INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS, if necessary. If you're first getting
   started with ACE and/or VxWorks, I recommend just building the ACE
   library and tests first. Some of the ACE examples, in System_V_IPC and
   Threads, don't build on VxWorks yet. Then try running the tests.
   Please see $ACE_ROOT/tests/README for the latest status of the ACE
   tests on VxWorks.
   
   Please note that the main entry point is renamed to ace_main on
   VxWorks, to comply with the VxWorks restriction against using main.
   Also, if you run ace_main directly from a shell, you'll probably have
   to restart the shell (using Ctrl-C, if enabled in your configuration)
   in order to be able to unld the module. Alternatively, you can spawn a
   new task to run ace_main, using either VxWorks sp, or ACE'S spa. spa
   can be used from the VxWorks shell to pass arguments to ace_main. Its
   usage is
    spa main, "arg1" [, ...]

   All arguments must be quoted, even numbers.

  Building and Installing ACE Network Services
  
   The following explains how to build the ACE [28]network services on
   [29]UNIX and [30]Win32.
   
    Building and Installing ACE Network Services on UNIX
    
   Building and installing ACE Network Services on UNIX is relatively
   simple (the [31]process for Win32 is different). Here's what you need
   to do:
   
    1. Build and install ACE on UNIX as described [32]earlier. If ACE is
       built at the root of the ACE source tree (and ACE has been ported
       to your platform, of course) the netsvcs static and shared object
       libraries should be built automatically. In addition, the server
       driver program (main) contained in
       [33]$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/main.cpp should also be compiled and
       ready to run.
    2. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to where the binary
       version of the ACE netsvcs library. For example, you probably want
       to do something like the following

% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    3. By default, if the shared object library is built, the services
       are linked into the main driver program dynamically. To specify
       which services should be linked in and executed, edit the
       [34]$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/svc.conf file. During your editing,
       you should update information (such as the default service port
       numbers) that affects the initialization of services in this file.
       Refer to the [35]Service Configurator documentation to learn how
       the configuration file is parsed and how the services are
       dynamically linked and executed. In addition, refer to the
       [36]Network Services documentation to learn more about how to
       configure each network service.
    4. If you only want to link the services statically, simply remove or
       rename the svc.conf file.
       
    Building and Installing ACE Network Services on Win32
    
   Once again, there are supplied project for both MSVC 4.x and 5.0 for
   the Network Services.
   
   If you are using MSVC 4.x, you will need to add another directory to
   your global include and library paths, ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/lib. When you
   use the dynamic libraries, make sure to also include
   ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/lib in your PATH.

    Cloning the Source Tree
    
   On UNIX platforms, I typically like to support multiple platform
   builds using the same ACE source tree. This idiom is supported by ACE
   using the $(ACE_ROOT)/bin/clone.c program. To build clone, perform the
   following steps:
   
% cd $ACE_ROOT/bin
% make
% mv clone ~/bin
% rehash

   Then create a ./build subdirectory someplace (e.g., under $ACE_ROOT),
   and then invoke the top-level Makefile with the "clone" target, e.g.:
   
% cd $ACE_ROOT
% mkdir build-SunOS5
% cd build-SunOS5
% make -f ../Makefile clone
% setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd
% make

   This will establish a complete tree of links. When you do a make in
   this directory you will be producing object code that is not stored in
   the same place as the original source tree. This way, you can easily
   build another platform in a parallel tree structure.
   
   VERY IMPORTANT! 
   
   If you use the "clone trick" discussed above, make sure that the
   symbolic links are correctly in place before starting the build. In
   particular, if you plan to clone the tree, it is preferable to do so
   before you start a build procedure on the original tree. This is
   because the build procedure create object directories (.obj and
   .shobj) and the cloning procedure will clone these directories also.
   You would end up with links pointing to object files of another
   platform. If you clone the tree after you've done a build on the
   original tree, make sure to remove all ".obj", ".shobj" and (any other
   files or directories) in all subdirectories before starting the build
   on your cloned tree.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    Building CORBA Versions of ACE
    
   Note that if you are compiling with IONA's Orbix implementation of
   CORBA or Visigenix's implementation of CORBA, you'll also need to set
   ORBIX_ROOT to point to the root of the Orbix source tree and
   ORBELINE_ROOT to point to the root of the ORBeline source tree. Since
   many platforms don't have these CORBA tools the default for ACE does
   *not* incorporate them. Thus, if you are compiling with Orbix or
   ORBeline, make sure that you set the symbolic links for
   $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU and
   $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h to point to the the config* and platform* files
   that have "-orbix" in them!

    Additional Build Tips for MVS
    
   For all intents and purpose, MVS OpenEdition (OE) is another flavor of
   UNIX, therefore, the instructions under [42]Building and Installing
   ACE on Unix can be used along with the following additional tips:
   
   You can get a copy of GNU make that has been ported to MVS OpenEdition
   from the [43]IBM OpenEdition web site. ACE's make scheme generates
   compile commands that have options and operands interspersed. By
   default, the c89/cc/c++ compiler expects all options to precede all
   operands. To get around this, you must set a special compiler
   environment variable (_CXX_CCMODE) to 1 which tells the compiler to
   allow options and operands to be interspersed.
   
   Note that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is called LIBPATH
   on MVS.
   
   Shared objects are built a little different on MVS than on other UNIX
   implementations. This has been accounted for in the makefiles that
   come with ACE When the linker (via the cxx command) builds the
   libACE.so file it will also create a file called libACE.x. This is a
   side-deck file and it must be included in subsequent link edits with
   application code. For more information on this see the C/C++ MVS
   Programming Guide. If you want to build your application statically,
   i.e., using libACE.a instead of libACE.so, you can set ACELIB to
   ACELIB_STATIC in platform_mvs.GNU.
   
   When the libACE.so file is built (via the MVS pre-linker and binder),
   you will get a rc=4 from the pre-linker. This is ok. This is due to
   some warnings about unresolved references which should get resolved
   during the link step. Note, however, there shouldn't be any unresolved
   references from the binder (linkage editor). You can get pre-link and
   link maps by uncommenting the PMAP and LMAP lines in the
   platform_mvs.GNU file.
