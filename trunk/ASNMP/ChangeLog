	* Started to integrate the code into a more ACE-like style, e.g.,
 	  added a the "asnmp/" prefix to all the header files so that we
 	  don't need to play games with the -I flags and so we can always
 	  know where we're getting the headers from.

        * unpacked snmp++.tar.Z into ACE_wrappers, remove X11 support. If
 	  you need GUI support in a communications package, something's
 	  wrong, very wrong....

	* Change HP-UX Makefiles to use ACE makefile system

	* Change includes to use ACE OS Adaption Layer

	* change all OS calls to use ACE_OS:: versions

	* Add ACE_TRACE macros to all functions.

	* clean up the global namespace by puting all global functions
 	  into C++ classes as static member functions and make public only
 	  those that are used (uxsnmp.cpp, eventlist.cpp)

	* create README from readme.txt, COPYRIGHT files.

	* create tests/ directory rename ConsoleExamples to examples

	* cull out dead code modules and dump them into misc dir:
 	  oidname.cpp, ipresolv.cpp

	* ipresolv.cpp had broken hostname buffer size (200), when DNS has
 	  aways defined a max FQDN as 256...go figure.

	* add General Error handler since existing ones are not very
 	  useful in and of themselves.

	* change all _DEF to DEF_ since _ANYTHING is reserved for compiler
 	  writer namespace, NOT app writer

	* convert cmu code to use C++ new/delete from malloc/free so
 	  entire library uses C++ new constructor
