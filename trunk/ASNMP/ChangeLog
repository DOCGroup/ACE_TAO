	* Added Netbios address support to GenAddress
	  and added DecNetAddress, AppleTalkAddress classes per CISCO-TC.my
	  (ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs)

Tue Aug 19 20:19:32 1997  Michael R. MacFaden  <mrm@mrm-ss20.cisco.com (Michael R. MacFaden)>
      * change IpAddress::is_arpa() to is_private() and update the comments 
         per RFC 1597. Add new test routine to verify this function in 
	 tests/Address_Test.cpp

      * add IpAddress::to_octet(OctetStr& val) which is useful when having to
        send a network address as an Octet String as in CISCO-PING-MIB.my

      * Thanks to Amos Shapira <amos@gezernet.co.il> apply patches 
        to support IRIX 6.3. Stated request for:
          I think it would make things "righter" to make the code use C++
          strings (and maybe vectors?).

      * Begin testing on HP-UX 10.01 (missing ucontext.h)

Sat Aug  2 12:07:43 1997  Douglas C. Schmidt  <schmidt@flamenco.cs.wustl.edu>

	* Started to integrate the code into a more ACE-like style, e.g.,
 	  added a the "asnmp/" prefix to all the header files so that we
 	  don't need to play games with the -I flags and so we can always
 	  know where we're getting the headers from.

      * NOTES: This first version only tested on Solaris 2.5

      * review classes for thread safety. Current thread design only 
        allows for one thread to safely access any ASNMP object created.

      * run purify test of get routine no -memory leaks.

      * verify both shared archive/static archive types work with
 	example programs

      * << Globals Changes >>

        * tested only archiver library version 

	* reformat code to use one brace style. 

      	* changed all manifest constants defined as _XX to XX_ to stay out
 	of compiler namespace

      	* change all OS calls to use ACE_OS:: portability layer, #include
 	<ace/OS.h>

	* reformat code to use one consistent brace layout and redo
        header using ACE 

	* remove semicolons on member functions foo{}; - not necessary 

	* make get() methods const member functions

	* removed unnecessary casts that looked like this: and revamped
 	  all memory allocations via ACE_NEW macro

	  new_oid = (SmiLPUINT32) new unsigned long [ smival.value.oid.len

	  To

	  ACE_NEW(new_oid, SmiUINT32[ smival.value.oid.len])

	* Collapsed default constructors with constructors to constructors
 	  with default arguments.

	* removed unused #include <iostream.h> 

	* Added ACE_TRACE() to classes

	* change get_printable() to to_string() - there will be more java
 	  programmers in the future so this should be the first step...

	* removed ASYNC interface till it can be rebuilt using ACE patterns

	* Attempt to make interface more type strict but leaving generic
 	  interfaces as escape hatch. Example: CTarget becomes UdpTarget
 	  for UDP/IP based agents.
 
      * << Class Specific Changes >>

        * Oid class:
	  - remove char * routines, simplify class
	  - added suboid method and removed get_printable() overloads

	* CTarget class:
	  - renamed to UdpTarget. Stay out of Microsoft Namespace per MSJ
	  Article by Allen Hollub. 

	* Varbind class:
	  - remove generic set_value for char,int, etc. Too easy to get
	  this wrong. Allow just types defined. 
	  - added overload for equality operator (==)
	  - added new constructor to allow setting full vb state oid,value, exception  
	  - add to_string()

	* Address class:
	  - change manifest constants to enums for address lengths, add IP V6 lens

	  - add a netbios name class, still pretty worthless since I don't have spec
	    in front of me yet...

	  - rewrite resolver calls to be thread safe and cleaner by moving to two
	    class (static) member functions:

	    // thread safe routine to lookup ip address given hostname
	    // return <> 0 on error
	    static int resolve_to_addr(const char *hostname, in_addr& quad_addr);

	    // thread safe routine to lookup name given ip address
	    // return <> 0 on error
	    static int resolve_to_hostname(const in_addr& quad_addr, char *hostname)

	* added some interrogation routines to class IpAddress:
	  is_loopback() const;

	* Ctr64 class:
	  - added constructor using long long datatype (needs to be made
	  portable to NT

	* Pdu class: add to_string()

	* Classes added wpdu class:
	  - a new adpater class between CMU and HP pdu, varbind data structures

	* transaction class:
	  - implement get/getnext timeout and retry logic using ACE
	  Reactor class, ACE_Time_Value
 
Sat Jul  5 19:13:30 1997  Mike MacFaden  (mrm@mrm-ss20)

        * unpacked snmp++.tar.Z into ACE_wrappers, remove X11 support. If
 	  you need GUI support in a communications package, something's
 	  wrong, very wrong....

	* Change HP-UX Makefiles to use ACE makefile system

	* Change includes to use ACE OS Adaption Layer

	* change all OS calls to use ACE_OS:: versions

	* Add ACE_TRACE macros to all functions.

	* clean up the global namespace by puting all global functions
 	  into C++ classes as static member functions and make public only
 	  those that are used (uxsnmp.cpp, eventlist.cpp)

	* create README from readme.txt, COPYRIGHT files.

	* create tests/ directory rename ConsoleExamples to examples

	* cull out dead code modules and dump them into misc dir:
 	  oidname.cpp, ipresolv.cpp

	* ipresolv.cpp had broken hostname buffer size (200), when DNS has
 	  aways defined a max FQDN as 256...go figure.

	* add General Error handler since existing ones are not very
 	  useful in and of themselves.

	* change all _DEF to DEF_ since _ANYTHING is reserved for compiler
 	  writer namespace, NOT app writer

	* convert cmu code to use C++ new/delete from malloc/free so
 	  entire library uses C++ new constructor
