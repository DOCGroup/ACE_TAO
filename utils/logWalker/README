This utility is intended to assist in the analysis of large debug output
files generated with -ORBDebuglevel 10. The utility summarizes thread,
connection, and invocation details for a collection of related processes.

This is a work in progress. It currently is limited to parsing logs of
IIOP based apps only.

The executable is installed as $ACE_ROOT/bin/tao_logWalker.

The command line options are:

  -t <version>	 	 where <version> represents a TAO minor version
     			 number, currently 1.5 through 2.0 are supported.
			 As variations in logfile output bound to version
			 are found, this option will expand and may include
			 micro release numbers as well. Default is 2.0.

  -o <filename>		 redirects the output to the named file rather than
     			 standard out.

  -d <directory>         breaks the output into multiple files under the
     			 named directory. The directory will be created if
			 it does not exist. -o and -d are mutually exclusive.

  -p <name=value>	 allows the tagging of processes participating in
     			 a logged run, but for which no log file exists. The
			 name in this case is some alias which will appear in
			 the output, and value is the TCP endpoint used by
			 the phantom process.

  -a <name=value>	 allows for substitution of addresses. Some endpoints
     			 may be logged using a hostname, while other instances
			 may appear as an IP address. This is a simple means
			 of substituting one for the other to improve the
			 recognition of a peer process.

  -m <filename>		 read argument from the named manifest file. For
     			 repeated analysis of may perhaps distributed log files,
			 use a manifest file to minimize keying in long command
			 lines. Each line of the file contains one full argument.

  [alias=]logfile        provide as many log files as needed. The optional
  			 alias gives a way to assign a useful name to the process
			 that generated the log output in the file. If many
			 processes shared a logfile so that their output is
			 comingled or consecutive, each process instance will be
			 given an indexed alias such as alias_1, alias_2, etc.

Below is a sample output resulting from a run of tests/Hello, which can be
reproduced by running: ./tao_logWalker -m hello.mft
