This test specializes in the Interface Repository support of
valuetypes and the IDL extensions that were added to
support the CORBA Component Model (CCM). Testing of most of
the other IDL types can be found in the nearby IFR_Test
directory.

The test can be run automatically by executing the provided
Perl script run_test.pl. If debugging of one or more of
the processes is desired, each can be run by hand, in the
same order that they are found in the script. The script
also shows reasonable command line arguments for each process.

No code is generated from the IDL file. It is there only to
have its contents loaded into the IFR by the Interface
Repository loader, tao_ifr.

The -d option may be passed to the client, which will then
output detailed messages in the event of a test error.
Otherwise, only test success or failure will be output.

All the numeric and string constants, storing the names, flags,
and sequence lengths found in test.idl, appear at the top of
idl3_client.cpp. This allows the test to be easily extended
to cover more complicated use cases.

More information about the Interface Repository can be found in
TAO/docs/releasenotes/index.html.
