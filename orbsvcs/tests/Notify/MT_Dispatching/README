Notification MT Dispatching Test
================================

Description
-----------
This test exercises multi-threaded aspects of the Notification service.
Dispatching, consumer filter evaluation and supplier filter evaluation.  It
also runs the notifcation service in single-threaded mode.

Usage
-----

The test consists of a Structured_Supplier and Structured_Consumer.  The
usage for each as is follows:

$ Structured_Supplier -\?
usage:  Structured_Supplier -o <iorfile> -e <# of events> -f

$ Structured_Consumer -\?
usage:  Structured_Consumer -k <ior> -c <# of consumers> -e <expected events>
                            -f

To run this test, just run the run_test.pl perl script.  It will run both
structured and sequence tests with each of the implemented discard policies.


Expected Results
----------------
********* Running multi-threaded dispatching test *******

********* Running multi-threaded consumer filter evaluation *******

********* Running multi-threaded supplier filter evaluation *******

********* Running single-threaded notification service *******


If an error is encountered, the perl script will exit with an error status.
