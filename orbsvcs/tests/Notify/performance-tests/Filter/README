Notification Performance Test
================================

Description
-----------

Usage
-----

The test consists of a Structured_Supplier and Structured_Consumer as well
as a Sequence_Supplier and Sequence_Consumer.  The usage for each as is
follows:

$ Structured_Supplier -\?
usage:  Structured_Supplier -o <iorfile> -e <# of events>

$ Structured_Consumer -\?
usage:  Structured_Consumer -k <ior> -c <# of consumers> -e <expected events>
                            -f

$ Sequence_Supplier -\?
usage:  Sequence_Supplier -o <iorfile> -e <# of events>

$ Sequence_Consumer -\?
usage:  Sequence_Consumer -k <ior> -c <# of consumers> -e <expected events> -f


To run this test, just run the run_test.pl perl script.  It will run both
structured and sequence tests with each of the implemented discard policies.


Expected Results
----------------
This varies between hardware.
