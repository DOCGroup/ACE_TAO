Portable Interceptors


File: DevGuideExamples/PortableInterceptor/PICurrent_NameService/README


This directory contains an example that shows how the PICurrent can
be used to stop client-side interceptor recursions. This example is
identical to the ../PICurrent example but uses the Naming Service.

This example is based on the Messenger example in GettingStarted
directory.  A message is send by MessengerClient and displayed by
MessengerServer.  When the client receives a reply, it asks the server
for the current time. This causes a recursive call at the receive_reply()
interception point. A flag is passed in the PICurrent to let the client
know the call is recursive.

How to Run
----------

Start the Naming Service:
-------------------------
$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/Naming_Service/Naming_Service \
        -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://localhost:9876

To start the server:
------------------
./MessengerServer \
        -ORBInitRef NameService=iioploc://localhost:9876/NameService

To start the client:
------------------
./MessengerClient \
        -ORBInitRef NameService=iioploc://localhost:9876/NameService

Execution via Perl Script
-------------------------

A Perl script has been created to automate the steps shown
above.  This script can be run via the following command:

./run_test.pl
