        CosEC_Multiple
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test for the Cos Event Service has 2 executables - one for suppliers
and the other for consumers.
Both connect to a running Event Service.

To run a test manually:
1. Start one or more consumers.
2. Run a Supplier, the consumer displays the data received.

The command line parameters for the Supplier are:
 -n <Name of the Event Service>,the default name is "CosEventService"

 -c <event_count>, number of events to send to the CosEC.

The command line parameters for the Consumer are:
 -n <Name of the Event Service>,the default name is "CosEventService"

 -c <event_count>, number of events to receive from the CosEC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Scripts:

run_test.pl - Event filtering using the RtEC.

This test starts up 2 CosEC's connected to one RtEC as shown..

                          ---------
                          | RtEC  |
                          ---------
                             |
                             |
                     ________|____________
                    |                    |
                ____|____            ____|____
               | CosEC1 |            | CosEC2 |
     "cosec1"  _________             _________   "cosec2"
                  |                     |
             _____|________        _____|_______
                |      |            |         |
            consumerA supplierB  consumerB supplierA

The CosEC1 (see fig.) is setup with these parameters:
# cos event service name = "cosec1"
# for ConsumerQOS: EventID = 21, SourceID = 6
# for SupplierQOS: EventID = 20, SourceID = 5

The CosEC2 (see fig.) is setup with these parameters:
# cos event service name = "cosec2"
# for ConsumerQOS: EventID = 20, SourceID = 5
# for SupplierQOS: EventID = 21, SourceID = 6

This setup configures the CosEC's such that consumerA connected to CosEC1 receives events from supplierA connected to CosEC2.
similarly, consumerB and supplierB form the other pair.

Parameters:

-e event_count, The number of events supplied by each supplier
                and also the number of events that a consumer will count
                before shutting down.

To execute this test, run the run_test.pl script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
run_test2.pl: demostrates multiple consumers and suppliers connected
to one CosEC.
This test has the following params -

-e event_count, The number of events supplied by each supplier
                and also the number of events that a consumer will count
                before shutting down.

-c consumers, The number of consumers to connect the Event service.

-s suppliers, The number of suppliers to connect the Event service.
