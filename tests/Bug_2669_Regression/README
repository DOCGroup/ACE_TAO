This test checks that the repository ID is correct for generated AMI reply handler servant classes when different pragma prefixes are used.

It does this by checking that handlers for interfaces in an IDL inheritance relationship can be narrowed to their parents handler types.

_Expected Success Output_

E:\sm\worcvs\tao14\prism\tests\tao439_regression>run_test.pl
Test Passed.

_Expected Regression Output_

E:\sm\worcvs\tao14\prism\tests\tao439_regression>run_test.pl
Error: REGRESSION - Cannot narrow ChildModule::ChildInterface reply handler to i
ts parent handler type.
Error: REGRESSION - Cannot narrow ChildInterface reply handler to its parent han
dler type.
ERROR: client returned 1

(or anything else with the word REGRESSION in)

All other output is an unexpected problem.
