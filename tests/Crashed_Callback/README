@page Crashed Callback Test README File

	On TAO-1.1.12 the ORB would dead-lock when trying to send a
callback to a crashed server.  As far as we know it only happens with
reliable oneways.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
